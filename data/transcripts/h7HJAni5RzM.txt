[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   I should like to call your attention once more to the words which are to be found in
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.640]   the book of Genesis chapter 26 verses 17 and 18.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.680]   And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.720]   And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.400]   his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.360]   And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.320]   We come back again to this incident because we are suggesting that it gives us such a
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.960]   perfect portrayal and representation of the state of the Christian church today.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.480]   We are in need of this vital living water, this life, this life of the Spirit.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.440]   And we realize that it is to be obtained in certain places and in a certain way.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.000]   But as we go and seek it there, we discover that we are confronted by the work of the
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.400]   modern Philistines, even as Isaac was in his day and generation.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.960]   In other words, my suggestion is that there are certain hindrances to revival, and that
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.620]   our first business is to face them and to get rid of them.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.040]   It is not that we can produce revival, but the history of revivals, as the teaching of
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.200]   the Bible indicates very clearly, that this is our work.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.600]   It is for God to grant us the blessing.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.840]   But it seems clear that in the presence of certain things we have no right even to expect
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.840]   revival, nor even to pray for it.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.040]   And therefore we have been considering some of these obstacles, and we have dealt first
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:01.480]   with a failure to believe certain vital and essential truthsâ€”the lack of orthodoxy.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.600]   The history of revivals demonstrates that beyond any doubt at all.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.040]   The men whom God has blessed and used, and the churches that have experienced revival,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:19.560]   have been those who have believed certain cardinal tenets of the Christian faith, invariably.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.760]   And then secondly, we have been looking at what we have called a faulty kind of orthodoxy,
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.000]   and have seen that this in turn can be a hindrance.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.440]   And indeed we have come beyond that to consider what I am describing as a kind of dead orthodoxy.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.800]   For this again can be a hindrance.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   To be orthodox is essential, but to be orthodox alone is not enough.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.680]   There is, alas, such a thing as a dead orthodoxy, which is not only useless, but is even an
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680]   obstacle.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.560]   And we have been considering this condition and its manifestations.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.360]   And we have considered so far a general state of contentment.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.840]   Now I say a general state of contentment, and we have considered its manifestations.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.080]   And then we went on to deal with the fear and dislike of what is called enthusiasm,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.320]   or to put it in another way, the terrible danger of quenching the spirit.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.080]   Though we are orthodox, we may be guilty of quenching the spirit, and it is a terrible
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.340]   thing to do.
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.320]   But I want to proceed with this consideration of this condition of dead orthodoxy, because
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.480]   I have a feeling that it is the one that is of the most vital and urgent importance for
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.780]   us.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.480]   And I am anxious, if I can, to complete this this morning, in order that we may go on to
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.160]   look at the whole subject of revival more directly and more positively.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.080]   But what are the other manifestations of this condition of dead orthodoxy?
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.280]   Well one is a failure to apply the truth.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.600]   Now it is one thing to believe the truth.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.040]   It is a very different thing to apply it.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:17.800]   And there is this dread possibility that we may be content with just listening to the
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:25.120]   truth or reading the truth, and never really applying it to ourselves.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.320]   We have done so initially, otherwise we would not be Christians at all.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:37.360]   But it is possible for us, once we have done the initial thing, to go on, I say, just listening
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.080]   or reading and never applying the truth to ourselves, or if you prefer it in another
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.680]   form, never examining ourselves in the light of the truth.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.440]   Isn't this one of the most alarming possibilities in the Christian life?
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.740]   We may come here or go somewhere else Sunday by Sunday, and we may read the Bible and may
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.900]   read books which help us to understand the Bible, and ever and again we are disturbed.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.160]   We feel a sense of conviction.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.200]   We feel, yes, now that is right, and we are aware of an inadequacy within ourselves.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.240]   But unfortunately we do nothing about it.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   It just comes and it goes.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.120]   As the Prophet Hosea puts it, "Our goodness is like a morning cloud.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.160]   It appears, it vanishes."
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.560]   This is, it seems to me, one of the most terrible dangers in connection with the Christian life
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:47.440]   as a whole, that we are content with surface disturbances, but never really face it, never
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.200]   really get down to the situation and to the problem, never proceed to continue this disturbance
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.400]   and to say, "Well, now what is this and what can I do about it?"
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.960]   I believe this is one of the greatest dangers afflicting all congregations.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.520]   Of course, the very fact that we are in a congregation in itself tends to produce the
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.520]   danger.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.360]   We may feel something during the service, and we may say, "Well, now I am going to
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   deal with that."
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.320]   But then, going out to the service, we start talking to people and we talk about other
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.720]   things altogether, and it is gone, and it never comes back.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.960]   And thus we may spend our lives like that, aware of superficial, temporary disturbances
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.040]   which never lead to anything at all.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.640]   I must not stay with this.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.440]   But it does seem to me that that was the essential trouble with the children of Israel, as we
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:49.120]   find their condition depicted in the writings of the prophets of the Old Testament.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.160]   Slight disturbances and the false prophets healed them too quickly, and we are all false
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.200]   prophets with respect to ourselves.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.420]   Well, now, there is one manifestation of this failure to apply the truth.
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.240]   But I would put it in another way.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:13.640]   Is there not a general tendency to neglect altogether the art of meditation, the art
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.940]   of real thinking?
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.400]   As one reads the story of the Church, and as one reads especially the story of the Church
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:32.240]   in better periods, when God's people and God's cause counted mightily in this land,
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.720]   as one reads about the Church in general and the individual biographies of Christian people,
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.480]   one cannot but be struck by the extraordinary contrast between them and ourselves.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.080]   And this is one of the big things.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.360]   Meditation played such a big part in their lives.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:02.480]   They would spend hours thinking, meditating, ruminating, if you like, upon the Word.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.040]   But this is something that has almost disappeared.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.840]   And our statement, of course, is that we are all too busy, and we are too busy.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.160]   Our whole lives are cluttered up with things that finally won't matter at all.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160]   Our programs are so full.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.600]   We haven't got time, we say.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.960]   We are too busy.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.360]   And you know, you can be so busy in the work even of the Christian Church that you are
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.520]   doing great harm to your soul.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.560]   You can become superficial and dry, and eventually useless.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.760]   No, no, meditation is absolutely essential.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:45.200]   Oh, there's a line in a well-known hymn which puts it perfectly, "Take time to be holy."
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.360]   And you've got to take time to be holy.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.280]   But we today, I say, are busy, rushing hither and thither, full of activities.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.480]   And our Christian spiritual life is so superficial.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:03.320]   Of course, on paper it may look very wonderful, and the religious journals will report it.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.120]   They're only interested in activities, because it's what they call news.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.960]   Somebody's doing something that's news.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.680]   Meditation is something that you can't put into your news columns.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.560]   It's too deep, it isn't sufficiently spectacular.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.280]   And thus, you see, the whole tendency today is to live in terms of activities.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.640]   And it looks so impressive.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.840]   But the way to test a Christian life is by, is depth, the test of depth.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.360]   The test of true understanding.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:39.720]   And that is only obtained by meditation and by thought.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.200]   And this is a bit of the discipline of the Christian life.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:50.640]   And as I say, you will find that it is invariably present in times of true revival.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:56.000]   Well, let's go on to consider another, which follows from that.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.280]   Meditation always leads, of course, to true self-examination.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.280]   But today, self-examination is not popular.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.400]   There are those who would even teach that self-examination is wrong.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.520]   No, no, they say you mustn't do that.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.880]   You must always be looking to the Lord.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.440]   And they say that in a wrong way.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.520]   Of course, our whole life ultimately is a life of looking to the Lord, but not at the
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.240]   expense of self-examination.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:35.600]   The scriptures exhort us to examine ourselves, to test ourselves, to prove our own selves.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:43.840]   And as I say once more, the literature of the past brings this out so clearly.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:49.240]   You read the life of any man who has ever been used of God in a signal manner in connection
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.840]   with revival, and you will always find he has been a man who has examined himself.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.520]   And he has become alarmed at himself.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.120]   It has always been the thing that has led him to God and to prayer.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.480]   His astonishment at himself.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.020]   But if we don't examine ourselves, we will never truly pray.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.560]   And our lives, as I say, will be lived entirely on the surface.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.440]   Now how little do we hear today about self-examination.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.240]   Oh, we believe in having a quiet time, a short reading of scripture, a hurried prayer, off
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.280]   we go, we've done everything.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.660]   But where is self-examination?
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.580]   How much talk is there about mortification of sin?
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.320]   Mortification of our members that are on the earth.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.640]   These are the apostolic injunctions.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.920]   Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.400]   If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:51.440]   These are Paul's instructions, but we never hear about these things.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.040]   You see, we've got a false notion concerning sanctification.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.960]   And we say we are looking to the Lord.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.800]   And thus our life is lived entirely on the surface.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:08.960]   It not only lacks in depth, it lacks in a true and in a vital holiness.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.280]   Well these are but aspects of this failure to apply the truth.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:19.100]   But to balance the truth and to put it fairly, I've got to go on to say this.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.800]   That while it is probably true to say of the majority today that they don't believe in
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:31.080]   self-examination at all and don't do it, there are some who are guilty of a faulty self-examination.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.680]   And this can be equally bad.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:42.680]   There are those who are guilty of a dead orthodoxy because of a misapplied self-examination.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.680]   Now what do I mean?
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.200]   I mean something like this.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.760]   There is a wrong way of examining ourselves as well as a right way.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.940]   The right way of course is the one that's indicated in the scriptures.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.820]   And that always leads to a good result.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.600]   But there is a wrong way of examining ourselves which does not lead to a good result, but
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:11.240]   leads rather to morbidity and leads to a false introspection.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.160]   This is a very subtle matter, but there are many good people today in the Christian church.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.440]   They're absolutely orthodox.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.160]   They do take time and they're concerned about self-examination.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.320]   Yes but they're utterly paralyzed and they're quite useless because in a sense they do nothing
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   else.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.840]   They spend the whole of their time in examining themselves.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.680]   And they look inwards and they dwell upon their own unworthiness and they're so conscious
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.360]   of all their sins and their unworthiness that they never do anything.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.240]   The whole time is taken up about their condition.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.760]   Indeed they're so busy examining themselves and they're so depressed as the result of
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.340]   doing it that they've got no time to pray for revival.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.900]   They never pray for anything else.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:59.220]   They're always praying about their own souls and their own personal condition.
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.600]   Now obviously this is quite wrong.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.060]   And this is quite as bad as the superficial kind of life that never examines itself at
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.480]   all.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:17.660]   So we can lay it down as a principle that the Christian should never be depressed and
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.660]   miserable.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.660]   Never.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.220]   A miserable Christian is a contradiction in terms.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.500]   The Christian has no right to be depressed.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.780]   Well why are people in this condition?
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.980]   And it seems to me the answer is, as I suggested, that they are not examining themselves in
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.620]   the light of the scripture.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.640]   For if you follow the scriptural method you'll do something like this.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.060]   You will allow the truth to search you.
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.180]   You will apply it to yourself.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.100]   You'll preach to yourself.
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.460]   You'll talk to yourself.
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.620]   You'll meditate about these things.
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.140]   You'll bring yourself under conviction and you won't let yourself escape.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.180]   But you don't stop at that.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:05.940]   Having thus found your true condition, you will allow the scriptures to lead you to the
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:12.700]   Lord Jesus Christ and to the cleansing of his blood.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:19.580]   In other words, any Christian who is depressed and morbid and introspective is rarely failing
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:24.100]   to apply the doctrine of justification by faith only.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:29.300]   If you stop in your sins, if you stop in the dust and the ashes and in the sackcloth, I
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.380]   say you're not scriptural.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:38.060]   You must go on from that and look to him and apply again the truth to yourself and be certain
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:45.060]   that you end in a condition of thanksgiving and praise and a realization that your sins
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:51.900]   are covered and blotted out and that you are renewed and that you are able to go forward.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.500]   Well you see how subtle all this is.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.740]   But isn't it true at the present time?
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.660]   There are many who are not praying for revival.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.940]   Well, because they're living such a superficial life they don't even see the need of revival.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.460]   They're busy and active and they're rushing here and there.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.660]   There's no time to think about revival.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.660]   All is well.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.340]   Look at it, at the appearance on the surface.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.820]   Not aware of their real condition as I'm going to show you.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:21.420]   But then there are these others who are so morbidly self-centered and turned in upon
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:27.140]   themselves that rarely they have no time to think of anybody else.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:35.140]   Thus you see the absence of self-examination or a faulty self-examination can lead to this
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.620]   condition of dead orthodoxy.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:43.980]   But come let us turn to something else which is more positive and which I do want to emphasize
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.180]   chiefly this morning.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.100]   I would put it thus as a hidden.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:57.860]   Dead orthodoxy is so commonly guilty of a failure to realize the glorious possibilities
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:07.340]   of the Christian life and therefore of a consequent failure to realize our own poverty.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:12.980]   Now I do trust that this is going to be plain and clear.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:18.980]   I am talking about the failure to realize the possibilities of the Christian life in
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.660]   this present world.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.660]   What do I mean?
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.500]   Well I mean the kind of thing that the Apostle Paul writes about, you remember.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:35.380]   There in the third chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians that we were once considering
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:40.940]   together towards the end of that great chapter, this is the sort of thing I'm referring
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.940]   to.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.900]   Let me read you some of these great verses.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.940]   The Apostle says that he's praying for these Ephesians.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.700]   Oh, they've believed the gospel for some time.
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.300]   They've been sealed by the Spirit.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:56.540]   Yes, they're fine Christian people, but he's praying this for them.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:01.220]   That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.860]   by his Spirit in the inner man.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.080]   That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.860]   That he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.140]   what is the breadth and length and depth and height.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:23.860]   And to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:29.700]   That he may be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.100]   I mean that.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.780]   I mean also the kind of thing that the Apostle had in his mind in that third chapter of his
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.980]   epistle to the Philippians, which we have read at the beginning.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.180]   Here is his position.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:49.220]   He says, "Oh, my concern is that I may be found in him not having mine own righteousness
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.860]   which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.820]   is of God by faith, that I may know him."
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.140]   Says this man who knew him so well.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:08.540]   And the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.100]   unto his death.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.980]   There are what you may call the heights and depths of this Christian life, the possibilities
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.780]   to the Christian in this present world.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.540]   Now you not only find it here in the scriptures.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:32.540]   Once more I say as you read the biographies of the saints, as you read the story of what
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:39.180]   happens to people in a time of revival, you begin to read of people who have realized
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.900]   these possibilities.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:48.400]   They have come into an intimate knowledge of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.060]   They know what it is to be visited by them.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.900]   They know what it is to be raptured by their presence.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.540]   I have often quoted these things to you.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.960]   I remember quoting to you about an old Puritan who had an experience once when he was walking
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:08.140]   over a mountainside of Barren Road and just sat down by a well to drink a little water
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.900]   with the bread that he carried in his pocket as his meal.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:18.900]   And there suddenly the Lord Jesus Christ came to him and gave him manifestations of himself.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.500]   And how this man said that he learned more in that one brief experience than he had learned
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.820]   in fifty years of reading and studying and of meditation.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.820]   That is the sort of possibility.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.980]   And you get it, I say, as you read the biographies of these people.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.700]   You get it as you read the history of revival.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:44.980]   You hear of people talking about these communications and about their dealings with God and with
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:52.900]   the Lord Jesus Christ, the realizations of his presence, the manifestations of his love.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:58.860]   But when did you last hear somebody talking about things like that?
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:05.980]   How frequently are such people given such experiences today?
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.140]   I just put it to you in that form.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.940]   There it is in the scriptures, there it is in the history of the church.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.380]   Where is it today?
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:22.180]   When did you last have somebody coming to you and telling you with almost fear and trembling
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:32.260]   of some gracious visitation of the Spirit of God, of being almost overwhelmed by a sense
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:39.540]   of the nearness of the Lord Jesus Christ, of being filled with a sense of God's glory
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.940]   and of his love?
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.180]   Go and read about these things.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:49.420]   You will find it in the lives of people like Jonathan Edwards, and as I constantly point
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.740]   out, of people of all shades of theological opinion.
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.260]   You will find it in Edwards, you will find it in Whitefield, in Wesley, you will find
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:02.620]   it in the life of a man like Finney, you will find it in the lives of saints, Moody.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.900]   Why are we not experiencing these things, my friends?
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.260]   Do we realize that these are possibilities?
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:18.340]   Revival as we shall see more and more is God making himself manifest in this living way.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.820]   But this is possible apart from revival.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.620]   This can happen to the individual.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.900]   Why don't we know these things?
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:34.540]   Why aren't we thirsting and longing and yearning for these things?
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.620]   I think I can give a partial explanation.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:42.780]   It is because we are so like the people in the church at Laodicea.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:48.460]   This is what is said to them, you remember, by the risen Lord, "Because thou sayest,
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:55.220]   I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:02.300]   art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked."
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.420]   And you know that is the condition of the church today.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.500]   I am speaking even of evangelical people and evangelical churches.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:17.340]   We are poor and naked and wretched and miserable and blind, and we don't know it.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.860]   As I was saying last Sunday, we are the evangelical people.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.860]   We are all right.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.220]   But are we all right?
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.020]   The thing to do is not to examine ourselves in the light of those who are obviously wrong.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.100]   That is a very simple thing to do.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.860]   It may persuade us that we are all right, like the Laodiceans.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.540]   We have got everything, but what have we really got?
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.100]   What have we really got as possession?
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:46.700]   No, I fear that the trouble with us is that we are blind to our true spiritual state and
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.700]   condition.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.700]   Alas!
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.340]   We will persist in examining ourselves in the light of activities, and if we are busy,
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.740]   we imagine all is well.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.140]   But my dear friend, the test of a Christian is not his busyness and his activity.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.340]   It is his knowledge of God.
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:06.580]   It is his knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:14.140]   It is not difficult to be busy, but you try and realize his presence, and you will soon
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.700]   discover that you have got to give time to it.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.420]   Ah, there it is, it is this Laodicean condition.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:32.340]   Or, if I may put it in another way, I believe it is partly due to this also, that in a sense
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:40.700]   we are much too concerned with ourselves rather than being concerned with him.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.900]   Now you see there is a popular teaching, and it has been very popular for a number of years.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:50.940]   It is all put perfectly in the title of a famous book, "The Christian Secret of a
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.940]   Happy Life."
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.020]   That is it, that is the controlling outlook.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.620]   What must I do to be happy?
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.940]   Oh, but that is not the question.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:09.700]   It should be the Christian secret of a life with God, the Christian secret of the knowledge
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.900]   of God.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.740]   What I should aim at is not simply that I be delivered from certain sins that worry
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.740]   me.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.740]   Of course, they should be got rid of.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.820]   But the thing to be concerned about is not even that.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:26.540]   It is this, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.540]   his sufferings.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.180]   Yes, says this man, not as though I had already attained.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.180]   Paul is saying that.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.180]   He is dissatisfied.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:40.660]   Because, you see, his standard was not his happiness, but the possibilities of knowing
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:49.180]   him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.460]   We are too subjective, self-centered, concerned just about ourselves, wanting to get rid of
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.820]   our little problems.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:59.300]   You may feel that you are free from problems, but the question I ask you is this, to what
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.340]   extent do you know him?
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.180]   Do you know much about the breadth and the length and the depth and the height, and to
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:12.620]   know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, and to be filled with all the fullness of
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.140]   God?
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.220]   When did you last test yourself by that standard?
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   That is the question.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:26.500]   You see, if we are not testing ourselves by these standards, though we are orthodox, we
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.700]   are dead.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:35.440]   And another element, it seems to me, in this is that in a most extraordinary way we seem
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.980]   to be excluding experience altogether.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:45.060]   The slogan is, "Take it by faith."
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:53.460]   Of course, that is essential in your conversion, justification by faith only.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:27:01.620]   And it is right to say to a man at that point, "Believe this word.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.220]   Risk your all upon it.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.220]   Trust yourself to it."
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:10.160]   That is the correct initial statement to make to a man, but you must not stop at that.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.560]   You say to him, "Now that is all you do at this moment, but if you do that, you will
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:20.100]   be given an experience you will know for certain."
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.900]   But so often that second step is left out today.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.100]   And the whole of the prevailing teaching seems to be, "Experiences do not matter.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.100]   Do not worry about your feelings.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.740]   We are told right through the whole of the Christian life, from beginning to end, we
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.740]   are to take it by faith.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.180]   Do not worry about your experiences."
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.860]   They say, "Ah," they say almost in a patronizing way.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.060]   There are some people who talk about great experiences.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.860]   "Ah, but that is not great faith.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.940]   You know, real faith is a man who believes, though he has felt nothing."
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.860]   Well, I say that is all right as a preliminary step, but if you have never felt anything,
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.420]   if you have never had an experience, I say it is not faith.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.940]   It is mere intellectual assent and intellectual belief.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:06.500]   Because the whole of the Bible teaches experiences of God, and we are meant to experience God.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.620]   We are meant to know him, not simply to believe and to go on holding on to our belief and
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.620]   taking it by faith.
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:20.220]   That is only the first step, I say, and it is to be followed by a realization, by an
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.180]   understanding.
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:34.160]   And I feel that it is this error at this point that accounts for so much of the dead orthodoxy
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.300]   and is such a grievous hindrance to revival.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.780]   In other words, let me sum it up like this.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:45.060]   I am not interested in experiences as such.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.740]   I am not preaching this morning that men and women should simply seek experiences.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.420]   No, no.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.300]   What I am saying is this.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.820]   Seek God.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.220]   Seek to know God.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.700]   Seek to know his love.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.060]   Seek to be filled with this knowledge and all the fullness of God.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:12.940]   No, no, not the experience itself, but to experience him and to know him.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.620]   These men of the Bible, they knew him.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.780]   They spoke to him.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.400]   They realized his presence.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:24.060]   So have all the others whose lives I have been quoting to you.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.100]   But this seems to have vanished out of our whole conception.
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.340]   It is something you do not hear of these days.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.340]   What is the matter?
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:38.580]   Well, I am suggesting it is because we have become so afraid of false experiences that
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.980]   we are shutting out experience altogether.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:46.460]   As I was saying last Sunday, we are so afraid of certain excesses that we are guilty even
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.040]   of quenching the Spirit.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.300]   This is a painful matter.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.940]   I am preaching to myself as well as to you, my dear friends, but the trouble with all
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.820]   of us is we are much too healthy.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.860]   We are much too healthy.
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:07.380]   Humility is not frequently observed today, but a bouncing superficial self-confidence
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.820]   is the order of the day.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:18.500]   Meekness, humility, mourning for sin, consciousness of unworthiness and imperfection.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.100]   No, no, we are resting on our oars.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.100]   We are satisfied.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.420]   Oh, how unlike the Apostle Paul we are.
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:30.660]   You remember what he says, "Forgetting the things which are behind, they were wonderful
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.660]   things."
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.260]   Go over his story again.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.660]   Remind yourself of it.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.660]   What does he say?
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:41.500]   "Forgetting the things that are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:48.620]   before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.980]   He is pressing forward.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:56.260]   I know very few people who give me the impression of pressing forward.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.580]   It is sitting back today.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:05.540]   I do not see people straining at the leash, longing for more, desiring, seeking, working
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.100]   for more, praying for more.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.740]   I press toward the mark.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.340]   I am not given the impression of Christian people pressing on, forgetting the things
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.740]   that are behind.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:24.540]   Rather, it seems to me that instead of pressing forward toward the mark, we today are simply
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.580]   turning round and round in a circle.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.420]   I do not see much evidence of advance and of growth.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.420]   People are saved, they are given things to do, they are taken here and there, and they
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:39.500]   go on like that the rest of their lives, very busy, very active, some of them so much so
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.580]   that they have nervous breakdowns, they become tired, overworked people.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:44.580]   What is the matter with them?
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.180]   They are going round and round in the circle.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.580]   They are not pressing on toward the mark.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:53.140]   There is no growth, there is no development.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:58.340]   And you may spend fifty years of a very busy life in preaching the gospel or in organizing
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.180]   this or that, and you may know God no better at the end of the fifty years than you did
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.900]   at the beginning, and it is wrong.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.340]   We are meant to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:17.180]   We are meant to be pressing forward toward the mark, forgetting what we have got, desiring
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:23.380]   this, he is holding it out before us, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.460]   and the fellowship of his sufferings.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.780]   It is a terrible thing, but the trouble with us is that our lives are not centered on him.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.940]   They are not dominated by him.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.340]   We say, "Ah, yes, we are working for him," and then we leave him alone and we go on and
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.140]   on in our little activities.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.420]   We ask his blessing upon what we are doing, but oh, how often do we seek him himself,
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:51.020]   God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the presence of the Spirit in our lives.
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.580]   That is true Christianity.
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:59.860]   It is men who have sought that, who have always been used of God in revival, read their stories.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.660]   You need not take my word for it.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.180]   These are always the preliminaries to revival.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.980]   These people have felt that they are like the Laodiceans.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.980]   They say, "We have got nothing.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:17.500]   Oh, how naked we are," and they have gone to him and they have sought him.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.980]   These are some of the manifestations of a dead orthodoxy.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:28.940]   And then all this, of course, inevitably leads to this, a lack of true concern for the glory
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.500]   of God.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.740]   Is that true of us, I wonder?
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:42.900]   Have we a true concern for the glory of God in this godless age?
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.540]   Now, I am not asking, "Are you irritated by the sin of the age?"
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.540]   That is not my question.
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:53.340]   It is a simple thing to be irritated and to be annoyed by the blasphemy and the sin and
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:58.740]   the vice and the lewdness and the perversions and all that we see on our streets and in
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.740]   the newspapers.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.260]   It is an easy thing to be annoyed and to be irritated, but you need not be a Christian
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:08.700]   to be annoyed and irritated.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.260]   The Pharisees were annoyed in that way.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.220]   What is the test of a Christian?
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:26.580]   It is this, a grief and a sorrow in the heart because of the way in which men are not glorifying
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.180]   God.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:35.220]   Indeed the Psalmists, go back to your Old Testament, look at the Psalmist breaking his
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:43.460]   heart as he sees men ignoring God, uttering their blasphemies about him, desecrating his
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.180]   sanctities.
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.100]   The Psalmists broke their hearts.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.460]   They were grieved in spirit.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.900]   They could not sleep.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:56.300]   It was a burden and a concern to them.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:01.540]   Does this modern generation affect us like that?
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:09.580]   Do we know of grief because of the state of God's cause?
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:14.900]   Are we concerned about his glory and his honour amongst the people?
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:21.900]   To what extent do we feel a longing and a desire for the manifestation of God in his
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.220]   glory?
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:31.180]   How often do we say to ourselves, "Oh, that he would arise and scatter his enemies."
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:35.700]   How often are we aware of such feelings within us?
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:40.180]   Or are we simply thinking of it in terms of our activities and the success of our church
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.420]   or some organization we may happen to be interested in?
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.780]   Is it God-centered?
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.300]   Is it a grief for God's sake?
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:51.860]   Is it a desire that he may manifest his glory again?
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.100]   That is what always appears in times of revival.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.420]   Not that the church may be benefited, not that the people may come crowding into the
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.420]   church.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.420]   No, no.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:04.060]   The primary thing is that God and his glory may be made known.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.140]   That is the primary concern.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:13.500]   And then, of course, that in turn leads to the next thing, which is this, which is a
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:19.420]   corresponding lack of a true concern for the souls of those that are outside.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:24.460]   "Oh, but you say I'm very interested in mission work and I'm very active in my support
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.900]   in connection with such things."
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:31.060]   That's not what I'm asking you.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:35.500]   I'm not asking whether you are doing the thing to do in the Christian life, namely to support
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:40.180]   missionary activities home and abroad.
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:47.380]   I am asking whether you really have got a grief in your heart and in your mind because
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:52.860]   of the state of the unbeliever?
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:59.900]   Do we know much about what the fathers used to call a burden for souls?
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.820]   Does the thing press upon us?
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:07.500]   No, Christian people, it should, if we really believe what we claim to believe.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:12.340]   If we really believe that those people are dishonoring God and that they are going to
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:16.260]   hell, I say it would be a burden to us.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.180]   Why isn't it a burden to us?
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:25.540]   Oh, it's again because we are so busy, because we don't stop to think, because we don't
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:32.020]   work it out, because we don't analyze it, because of our inadequate notions of God and
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:39.700]   his glory and of the real state of these people.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:46.740]   Isn't there an absence of this godly concern, this burden for the souls of the lost?
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.780]   Well I think I could prove it to you if necessary.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:53.700]   I've been told by many pastors in all parts of this country that they've had experiences
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.700]   like this.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:59.180]   They say we've got plenty of people in our churches who will attend meetings as often
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:05.300]   and as regularly as you like, if they're big mass meetings particularly, but who simply
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:10.740]   will not come to the weekly prayer meeting.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.740]   Now that's the thing we've got to explain.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:22.260]   If they had a real burden and concern for souls, they would be there praying regularly
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:26.980]   in the unspectacular little prayer meeting.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.860]   That's the test.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:34.660]   The man who is really feeling the burden is a man who is being pressed by it and pressed
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.940]   to his knees and pressed into the presence of God.
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.340]   His supreme activity is prayer.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.740]   He does other things of course, but the big thing, the vital thing to him is prayer, for
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.420]   he realizes that this is a problem that God alone can deal with.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.740]   He knows the burden, and a man who is burdened is a man who prays.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.180]   So I end with that last point.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:05.780]   All this leads to a lack of prayer which is really urgent.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:13.660]   It leads to a lack of prayer that is really hopeful and expectant.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:23.020]   There is praying and praying, and true prayer is only possible when men and women have a
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:34.700]   God consciousness, when they know what it is to realize the presence of the Holy God,
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:40.860]   when they begin to have a zeal for his name and for his cause and the compassion for souls
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:47.760]   and the feeling of the pressure of the burden of their condition upon their spirits.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.500]   It is then and then only that we truly pray.
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:58.500]   Or we can be whipped up to pray, but that isn't prayer.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.520]   We can organize this thing, but that isn't prayer.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:06.080]   People are always ready to be organized because it is so much easier to do things you are
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.240]   commended to do and told how to do it than really to be alone, as it were, just God and
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:18.080]   yourself, and you face this matter and you go on doing so.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.760]   That is the way to prayer.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.520]   It is the only way to prayer.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:29.620]   It seems to me that the diagnosis of the condition therefore today is that our essential trouble
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:37.720]   is that we are content with a very, very superficial and preliminary knowledge of God, his being
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.840]   and his cause.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:51.040]   And content with that, we spend our lives in a busy activism instead of pausing to realize
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:58.540]   the possibilities, instead of realizing our own failure and realizing that we are such
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:03.080]   that we are not attracting anybody to Christ, that they see nothing in us that makes them
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.680]   desire to come to him.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:19.320]   The inevitable preliminary and the constant preliminary to revival has always been this,
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:30.160]   a thirst for God, a thirst, a living thirst for a knowledge of the living God, and a longing
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:42.440]   and a burning desire to see him acting, manifesting himself and his power, and rising and scattering
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.240]   his enemy.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:49.200]   I leave these questions with you.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.900]   God grant that we all may face them and continue to face them.
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:59.500]   To what extent do you know God?
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.580]   To what extent can you say honestly that you are forgetting the things that are behind
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:09.000]   and that you are pressing forward toward the mark, that your supreme desire is to know
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.840]   him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.760]   conformable unto his death?
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.600]   If by any means you might attain unto the resurrection from among the dead, to what
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   extent do we know of the fullness of God and this love of Christ which passeth knowledge?
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.000]   To what extent do we experience these things?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.400]   Do we know them?
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.080]   Are they living realities to us?
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:48.760]   The thirst for God and the longing for the exhibition of his glory is the essential preliminary
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.360]   to revival.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.260]   Amen.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.180]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
