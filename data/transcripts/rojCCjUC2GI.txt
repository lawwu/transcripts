[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.480]   - Another industry in which, I would say,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.780]   the only other industry in which there is automation
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.760]   actually touching people's lives today
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.400]   is autonomous vehicles.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.240]   What the vision you just described of using computer vision
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.360]   and using cheap camera sensors,
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.200]   there's a debate on that of LIDAR versus computer vision.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   And sort of, Elon Musk famously said
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.400]   that LIDAR is a crutch that really,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.760]   camera in the long term, camera only, is the right solution,
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.420]   which echoes some of the ideas you're expressing.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.720]   Of course, the domain in terms of its safety criticality
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.600]   is different, but what do you think about that approach
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.360]   in the autonomous vehicle space?
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.080]   And in general, do you see a connection
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.440]   between the incredible real world challenges
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680]   you have to solve in the home with Roomba?
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.840]   And I saw a demonstration of some of them,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.760]   corner cases, literally, and autonomous vehicles.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.560]   - So there's absolutely a tremendous overlap
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.560]   between both the problems, you know,
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.560]   robot vacuum and autonomous vehicle are trying to solve,
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.740]   and the tools and the types of sensors
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.600]   that are being applied in the pursuit of the solutions.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.920]   In my world, my environment is actually much harder
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.200]   than the environment in automobile travels.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   We don't have roads, we have t-shirts, we have steps,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.280]   we have a near infinite number of patterns and colors
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.080]   and surface textures on the floor.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.440]   - Especially from a visual perspective.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.640]   - Yeah, visually it's really tough.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.760]   - Is infinitely variable.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.440]   - On the other hand, safety is way easier on the inside.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.440]   My robots, they're not very heavy, they're not very fast.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.360]   If they bump into your foot, you think it's funny.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.820]   And, you know, and autonomous vehicles
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.480]   kind of have the inverse problem.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.300]   And so that for me saying vision is the future,
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.680]   I can say that without reservation.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.640]   For autonomous vehicles, I think I believe what
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.460]   Elon's saying about the future is ultimately
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.920]   gonna be vision.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   Maybe if we put a cheap lighter on there
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.640]   as a backup sensor, it might not be
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.700]   the worst idea in the world.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.880]   - So the stakes are much higher.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.720]   - The stakes are much higher.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.080]   - You have to be much more careful thinking through
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.620]   how far away that future is.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.120]   - Right, but I think that the primary
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.220]   environmental understanding sensor
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.660]   is going to be a visual system.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:30.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
