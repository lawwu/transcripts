[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   [Music]
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.400]   Well, it's Sunday night after a day of worship with the people of God, and musical worship
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.040]   is such an important part of our embodied life together.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.760]   But I don't think we've ever looked at lyrics of a contemporary worship song in a question
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.800]   in this podcast, but we do today.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.760]   Hello Pastor John, my name is Samuel, a young minister through music.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.200]   My church's worship team struggles with a new worship song, "What a Beautiful Name,"
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.360]   a widely acclaimed song because of its musical orchestration and because of its reflection
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.280]   on God's glory in the kingship of Christ.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.400]   However, my worship team finds the lyrics of the second verse questionable.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.040]   You didn't want heaven without us, so Jesus, you brought heaven down.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.720]   Our question is, does saying, "You didn't want heaven without us," imply a man-centered
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.000]   gospel?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.240]   The statement isn't necessarily false, but the implications could be skewed.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.520]   That's our fear.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.800]   Additionally, the word "so" is used afterwards, implying that the following statement of bringing
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.800]   heaven down was founded upon the first statement of not wanting heaven without us.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.840]   Much like the word "therefore," "so" implies heaven was brought down in response to God
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.840]   not wanting heaven without us.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.960]   So Pastor John, do you believe these lyrics are biblically valid?
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.120]   So let me start broad and then get specific because I love the issue.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.440]   I love the concern.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.120]   The first thing I want to do is praise God for a worship team that is struggling with
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.840]   issues of truth in song lyrics.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.800]   This is really good news.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.560]   It's a good sign, and I hope all worship leaders who hear this will be encouraged to do the
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.560]   same.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.200]   One of the reasons this is really good news and that it really matters is that a congregation
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:20.720]   learns its theology and takes it down into the crevices of their soul by songs that they
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.520]   sing, not just by the preaching they hear.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:32.000]   I think historically it's the hymnody of the church that has, alongside preaching, been
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.080]   one of the most powerful means by which a church is taught.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.640]   I would guess that in some churches the songs may be even more decisive in the way truth
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.280]   is embraced because the preaching may be so thin when it comes to doctrinal teaching.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.440]   Of course, the songs may be very thin as well.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.560]   You can sing very thin songs that just repeat even great sentences like "His name is great."
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.160]   That's true, but you don't ever say why it's great or how the cross grounds its greatness.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.280]   So I say amen to the struggle and commend every worship team to be vigilant over the
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.600]   lyrics of what their people are singing.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   That's the first thing.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:29.640]   Second thing I would say is that the last 30 years, maybe 40 now, have been an incredibly
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.560]   fruitful time for writing of new lyrics and new music for the church.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.440]   This is a great thing.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.480]   This is a great sign, I think, of life.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.240]   The psalmist says five times, "Sing to the Lord a new song."
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:59.280]   33-3, 96-1, 98-1, 144-9, 149-1, "Sing to the Lord a new song."
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.800]   And Jesus said, to balance things, "Every scribe," you could say every worship leader,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.560]   "who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.920]   out of his treasure what is new and what is old."
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.840]   Matthew 13, 52.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.720]   What this means is that given the hundreds and hundreds of worthy, substantial, rich,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:35.320]   deep old hymns that speak nourishing doctrinal truth, and given the many, many, many new
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:45.720]   songs of the last 30 years that are solid and Christ-exalting and gospel-rich and God-centered,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:55.000]   there is no reason for any church to sing songs that are misleading or even questionable.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.280]   That's the second thing I need to say.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:06.080]   It's not as though any worship team who has access to the internet is backed into a corner
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.520]   not knowing what to sing and having to sing something questionable, because there's hundreds
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.120]   of glorious, rich, beautiful, contemporary and old songs.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:26.320]   So my main response to Samuel is, find the old and the new that are rock-solid, beautiful,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.040]   and use them.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.640]   You are teachers in the church.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.640]   Let this sink in.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.120]   James says, "Let not many of you become worship leaders," because you're teachers.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.240]   Let not many of you become worship leaders because you are teachers, and teachers will
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.640]   be judged more strictly.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.960]   I mean, right after the pastor come the worship leaders who are choosing what teaching is
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.480]   going to happen while people are singing their hearts out and absorbing all this truth or
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.400]   non-truth that these people have put in front of them.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.680]   Now to the specific lyrics Samuel is concerned about.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:09.680]   There's a thread of teaching in some songs today that seems to me to lack the gravity
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.160]   of God's passion for the glory of God above all things.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.960]   Say that again.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.840]   There's a thread of teaching in some songs today that seems to me to lack the gravity
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.080]   of God's passion for his glory above all else.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:37.620]   My sense is that until a congregation is devastated by the outrage and the horror of our sin as
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:46.620]   demeaning and belittling to the glory of God, accompanied by a majestic vision of God's
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:54.820]   glory and justice and holiness and wrath, until those two realities are taught and felt
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:05.560]   deep down, the reality of grace and mercy will not be rightly known and cherished by
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.740]   a congregation, which really matters to me then how we sing about grace.
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:19.980]   Seems to me that we tend to assume that at least there's a strain or a thread of songs
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:29.940]   that tend to assume that people's sorrows and shame and difficulties in life is enough
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:36.020]   of a backdrop, a bad backdrop, to make the mysteries of the glory of the gospel known
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.020]   over against them.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.700]   I don't think so.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.260]   I don't think the sorrows and the shame that people bring without being taught what their
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.180]   real condition is, is enough to help them understand grace.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:56.740]   In fact, I think people are going to distort grace if it's not taught against the backdrop
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:02.100]   of the biblical bad news rather than the bad news that people bring, which they think they
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.060]   understand to be the bad news when it's not the bad news.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:12.400]   The New Testament assumes that people need to be taught what their real terrible condition
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.380]   is under the power of sin before grace can really be the God-exalting reality that it
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.380]   is.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:25.820]   And I see that in Ephesians 2, 1 to 10, and Ephesians 1, 4 to 6, for example.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:34.100]   So I think Samuel is right that the question is not whether a statement in a song is literally
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:40.900]   true by itself, but what effect, what effect it has on the people.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.820]   That is, how does it fit into their view of God?
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:52.020]   So it may be that the same truth will be sung one time in one context, but it will not be
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:58.220]   sung another time in another context because the whole tendency and tone of the context
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.420]   is going to be misleading.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.300]   It's going to confirm error in the hearts of the people.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.380]   I don't favor the lyric he quotes.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:18.540]   It fits too easily into a theology of a God who created because he was lonely and then
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.300]   saved people for the same reason.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.940]   He just can't be happy without us.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:35.460]   To be sure, we should sing about God's amazing delight in us as his children.
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.860]   Witness the father in the parable of the prodigal son throwing a party when his son comes home.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:47.280]   And witness Zephaniah 3.17 where God sings over his people.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:56.220]   But what is so amazing about that is that God is not miserable and lonely without us.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:03.860]   He's not motivated to sing over us because we have just made up for some poor deficiencies
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.020]   that God has.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:12.580]   And now at last his weakening deity is strengthened by our presence and he can be happy finally.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.900]   That's not the picture of the Bible.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:24.840]   His delight in us is the overflow of his fullness, not the compensation of his emptiness.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:30.940]   So does the song help the people feel that wonder?
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.540]   That's the question.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:38.220]   Here's another popular lyric that we just, I just got back from Asia and we sang this
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.220]   in Asian.
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.620]   I kind of wish they weren't singing this.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.700]   And it's very popular, "Like a rose trampled on the ground, you took the fall and thought
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.740]   of me above all."
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.820]   That's not true.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.820]   That's not true.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.820]   It's not helpful.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.140]   I'm not frankly even sure what it means.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.340]   Above all what?
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.460]   Above all other people who he saved?
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.740]   No, can't be that.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.820]   Above all his own glory?
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.700]   No, not his own glory.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.820]   Above all what?
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.900]   That was a beautiful song before it got to that line.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:23.460]   He saved us precisely so that we could see and savor his glory as the supreme treasure
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.660]   of the universe above all.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:32.380]   And I'm not sure what the lyrics mean, but it doesn't communicate to most people that.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:39.860]   So my conclusion is God has been at work in history and he's been at work wonderfully
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:47.220]   in the last 30 years to produce hundreds and hundreds of solid, gospel-rich, doctrinally
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:54.860]   faithful Christ-exalting, big God songs, so many that we don't have to use the ones that
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:01.740]   seem theologically skewed and that may mislead our people.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:08.180]   This is a first for APJ in talking about popular lyrics of a popular worship song.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.180]   And I found it fruitful.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.180]   I found it helpful.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.140]   This is really valuable content, I think, in thinking carefully about what we sing on
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.140]   Sundays.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.380]   So thank you, Pastor John, for investing your time and thought into this response.
