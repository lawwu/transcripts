[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.560]   the 84th Psalm. Looking particularly this evening at the third verse, so I'm going
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:24.040]   to read the first four verses. The first four verses of the 84th Psalm.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.080]   How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.080]   My soul longeth, yea, even fainter for the courts of the Lord;
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.000]   My heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.240]   Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, And the swallow a nest for herself,
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:59.120]   Where she may lay her young, even thine aughters, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.320]   Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; They will be still praising thee.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.080]   Now I want, I say particularly tonight, to deal with the message of the third verse.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.080]   Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, And the swallow a nest for herself,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.200]   Where she may lay her young, even thine aughters, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.920]   Now we are studying together these Sunday evenings the message of this 84th Psalm.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.400]   And we're doing so because it is a psalm written by a man who tells us, as these four
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.800]   verses in and of themselves remind us, that to him the greatest thing in life was to enjoy
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.320]   the blessings of the religious, or if you like, the godly life.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.960]   That is what he sets out to say.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.520]   To him this is more important than anything else.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.120]   He would give the whole world for this.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.600]   It means everything to him.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.140]   It not only means everything to him when all is going well, it still more means everything
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.400]   to him when things seem to be so conspiring against him as almost to drive him to despair.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.600]   There is nothing, he says, in the whole world that is comparable to this.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.440]   So he keeps on offering up his praise.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.040]   How amiable are thy tabernacles!
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.360]   O Lord of hosts, he ends, Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.640]   And you might well translate that word "blessed" by the word "happy."
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.160]   That's what it means.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.560]   Happy is the man that trusteth in thee.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.600]   And as I say, his theme is that there is no happiness on earth which is in any way comparable
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.800]   to the happiness of a man who knows God.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.120]   Now then, the great question for us is, are we able to say that kind of thing?
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.320]   Have we shared the experience of this psalmist?
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.160]   Can we say this evening that as far as we are concerned, the loving kindness of God
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.040]   is better than life itself?
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.880]   That's how another psalmist puts exactly the same thing.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.240]   Are the courts of God's house amiable to us?
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.640]   Which is just another way of saying, is this communion with God which we are enjoying to
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:43.400]   us the supreme thing in the whole of our life and existence and experience here in the world?
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   Very well.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.040]   It is in order that we may discover how to arrive at that, unless we already have it,
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.080]   that I am calling your attention to the message of this great psalm.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.080]   Because this man tells us that there are certain things which are absolute essentials if we
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.520]   are to enjoy it even as he had and was still enjoying it.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.000]   Now I've been dealing with the two great preliminaries so far.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.200]   We've been looking at the psalm in general, and there we have seen that the psalmist lays
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.400]   this down as a fundamental postulate.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.680]   It's no use going any further until we are clear about this.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.400]   Religion, finally, is a question of knowing God.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.440]   It isn't a matter of living primarily.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.880]   It isn't just a question of a good life or doing good.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.880]   No, no.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.840]   The essence of religion is to know God.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.320]   You notice how he keeps on impressing that upon us.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.640]   "O Lord of hosts, my King and my God, blessed is the man whose strength is in thee."
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.360]   That's it.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.160]   This knowledge of God.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.920]   And then he has been careful to tell us, wise teacher as he is, the only way in which that
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.720]   knowledge can be obtained, he says, "I have obtained it at the altars, and there is no
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.720]   other way."
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.440]   There is no way to know God except through Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.880]   This is the center of Christianity.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.540]   This is the beginning of Christianity.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.540]   Men must know God.
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.080]   Well, there is only one way.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.880]   Christ said so himself repeatedly.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.120]   He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.520]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.740]   That's his own claim.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.600]   So if you think you can arrive at God without him, you're already denying the first principles.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:47.560]   No, we've got to come through him, and we have got to realize further that we come through
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.480]   him, through his broken body, through his shed blood.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.320]   There is a new and living way which has been made in that way upon the cross on Calvary's
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.800]   hill.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.640]   The only thing that brings us into the presence of God is, says the author of the epistle
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.920]   to the Hebrews, "the blood of Jesus."
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.120]   Very well, there is the first thing.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.780]   And we've got to start with that, and we've got to realize it.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.200]   And then the second thing we saw was this, that we must realize that it is this objective
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.040]   truth about God that matters supremely.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.880]   We mustn't rest on our own feelings and experiences and moods and states.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.080]   There are many things that can give us happy feelings, but a happy feeling is not of necessity
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.640]   a knowledge of God.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.760]   It may result, it does result, from a true knowledge of God.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:51.120]   But according to this, men, unless we can know and rely upon the character of God in
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.160]   all its greatness and its majesty, we really have no foundation.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.520]   So we criticized a statement which had been made to the effect that the justification
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.800]   of a religion lies not in its truth but in its efficacy.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:16.000]   We assert that the value of any faith or any teaching resides primarily in its truth.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.720]   All right, there are the preliminary considerations, and we must realize them and accept them.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   But now, according to this, men, there is one other thing which we must also realize,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.440]   and that is the truth about ourselves.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:41.080]   There are two things, you see, which are always the two poles, as it were, of Christian truth.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.520]   Christian truth, if you like, is a kind of ellipse.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.320]   And there is one focus, God, but there's this other focus, men.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.280]   And if we are to enjoy the experience of this psalmist, we must be as right about men as
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.520]   we must be right about God.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.120]   He starts with God, we must start with God, but it isn't enough.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.080]   We must then come down and look at ourselves.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.400]   And he tells us that he has arrived where he has, and it's the whole teaching of the
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.440]   Bible, it is the very essence of Christian experience.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.480]   There has never been a Christian, there has never been a saint, who has not at one and
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.960]   the same time realized this two-fold truth, God and himself.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.480]   We've already stressed the fact that we must be right in our thinking about God.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:39.360]   Now tonight, I want to take up the other side and to stress and to emphasize that we must
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.480]   be equally right in our thinking about ourselves.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:51.000]   I just invite you to go through the lives of the saints, read the biographies of men
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.160]   who have trod this earth and have lived in it as you and I are doing at the present time,
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.360]   and who have been able to conquer life and to master it and to rejoice in spite of all
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.680]   adversity, and who have sung the praises of God.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:16.520]   And you will always find a man who has discovered certain things about himself.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.520]   It's invariable.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.600]   Now then, what are these things?
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.760]   Well very fortunately for us, the psalmist puts it in the form of a picture.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.360]   And it's a picture which rarely explains itself.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.760]   I just want to hold it before you briefly this evening.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:41.320]   You notice he puts it like this, he says, "The sparrow hath found a house, and the
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:48.120]   swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young."
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.560]   Now there are some people who completely misinterpret this statement, and they interpret it as meaning
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.040]   that the psalmist is more or less complaining.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:02.600]   He says, "Ah, the sparrow has found a house for herself, and the swallow has found a nest
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   for herself."
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.760]   "They have been able to build a nest on thine altars in the tabernacle, and I am far
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.760]   away from the tabernacle, and I can't find this place."
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.800]   Well the thing of course is monstrous.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.440]   You could never have a nest on the altar where the animal's bodies were broken up and then
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.440]   burnt.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.440]   It's impossible.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.640]   That's no place of safety for a sparrow or for a swallow.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.160]   That's a complete misunderstanding.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.920]   Now what the psalmist is saying is this.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.400]   He says, "I am like a sparrow.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:41.600]   I'm like a swallow, but I'm like the sparrow that has found a house for herself, and I'm
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:48.880]   like the swallow that has found a nest wherein she may lay her young."
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:55.560]   And thank God, he says, "The place where I found the right position and all the right
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:04.120]   conditions for making my nest and laying my young is thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.960]   King and my God."
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.240]   Now then, here then is his comparison.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.360]   Here is the secret, he says.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:20.200]   "It is only when I came to see myself as this man, as a sparrow and as a swallow, that I
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:27.840]   really discovered my need and then went to God and found my answer and my supply."
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.120]   Now then, I'm going to take up this picture.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:36.080]   You'll find it worked out in a more doctrinal and theological manner in many places in the
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.680]   New Testament.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.280]   If you like one at random, here it is for you.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.400]   Our Lord said, didn't he, that he had not come to call the righteous but sinners to
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   repentance.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.720]   He says, "They that are hurl have no need of a physician, but they that are sick."
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:57.960]   Or he says again, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   In other words, you will always find this element, "Man must realize his need."
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:12.960]   And the only man who knows what it is to enjoy the blessings of Christian salvation is a
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.760]   man who has already discovered his need.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:22.480]   The tragedy of so many outside Christ is indeed of all ultimately, is that they've never
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.600]   really seen their need.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.840]   That's why they've never seen a need of Christ.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.320]   That's why they don't fly to him as Savior.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.080]   They've never seen themselves.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.480]   Well now then, let's follow this man.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:40.280]   Let's follow his wonderful picture as he brings out in this pictorial way the needs of the
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:50.840]   soul, the realizations that drive a man to Christ and make him flee to him for salvation.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.800]   What are they?
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.120]   Well these are the things which I find here.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:05.200]   There are certain things that always characterize the truly religious man, the true Christian,
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.040]   and this is the first.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:13.640]   He is a man who has become aware of his own smallness.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.120]   A sparrow, a swallow.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.720]   A sparrow, you see, one of the smallest of the birds.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.400]   And the psalmist is saying, "Yea, in effect, I came to see that I was just like a little
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.520]   sparrow.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.000]   I was just like a little swallow."
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   What's he mean?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.160]   Well, let me put it to you like this.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:44.080]   No man is a Christian without realizing the immensity of life, the greatness of life.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.080]   And no man comes to realize that, of course, without thinking.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.120]   The trouble with us all in this world is that we tend to be absorbed in life and life sees
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.200]   to it that we never are given a moment to think and to meditate and to ponder.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.540]   We just take things for granted and we go on.
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:10.540]   But then suddenly a man begins to think and he begins to discover his own smallness.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.060]   And there are many who have discovered this in this world and it has led them to feel
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.100]   that they are but a sparrow.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.540]   What are you speaking of, says someone?
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.700]   Well, something like this.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.660]   Think of this vast universe in which we are situated.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.580]   And there are many people who argue like this at the present time.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:34.780]   They say that these discoveries of science have unfolded to us, especially during this
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.660]   century, this mysterious universe in which we live.
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.700]   And the scientists talk about billions and billions of miles.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.500]   They talk about all these vast constellations.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.140]   They're almost endless in number.
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.100]   And they say God is at the back of all.
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:56.940]   And then the immediate deduction is, well, who am I in such a vast universe?
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:02.420]   What is man that thou art mindful of him, as the psalmist puts it in the eighth psalm?
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:09.140]   He says, when I look at the heavens and look at the work of thy fingers, when he considers
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:14.340]   the moon and the stars and all these things, what is man that thou art mindful of him?
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.500]   He says the thing is incredible.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:22.020]   And there are many people who face the Christian salvation like that today, and they dismiss
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.700]   it and they divide it.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.340]   They say you Christians are too introspective.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.380]   They say you're too self-centered.
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.780]   You are exaggerating your own importance.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:37.860]   Who are you that the almighty and eternal God should be interested in you as an individual?
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.540]   There are many people who deny and reject Christianity for that reason.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:47.340]   They say I'm nobody, and then they begin to think of other things.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:54.220]   They think of all the teeming masses in this world, of all the millions upon millions of
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.220]   people.
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.500]   And what is the individual, they say?
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.260]   What is the value of the individual?
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.980]   Is he anything more than cannon fodder?
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.300]   When millions of people may be put to death suddenly by the explosion of one bomb, who
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.300]   am I?
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   What's an individual?
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.500]   And he says it's right for me to think about myself.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.940]   Is there any place for me?
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:23.820]   Thus men and women, I say, are overawed by the immensity of creation, by the huge mass
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:29.580]   of humanity and of mankind.
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.260]   And yet, you see, we are aware of ourselves as individuals.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.300]   We are aware of an identity.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:43.380]   I have my own life, and yet how small and how insignificant it seems to be.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.660]   Who can be concerned about it?
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.860]   What hope is there for me?
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.780]   Now there are many today who are appalled and overwhelmed by that consideration.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:58.060]   They say what is man after all but just a speck in a great lump, a great mass of humanity?
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.860]   Is man anything but a little cog in a great wheel?
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.860]   Does anything matter except the wheel?
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.740]   Is there any place for the individual?
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.860]   Thus I say, they become aware at one and the same time of the immensity of it all, of their
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:17.700]   own smallness and their own apparent utter insignificance.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.260]   The sparrow, the swallow.
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:28.860]   Ah, what I'm anxious to leave with you and to emphasize is just this.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:35.220]   That as I understand the teaching of the Bible, no man has ever become a Christian without
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.860]   having just some sense of that.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:46.820]   That here he is, as it were, a little focus in this vast business of life.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:52.660]   And he is conscious of his unutterable smallness, and he's tempted to think that he's so small
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.980]   that he's finally insignificant.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.660]   But let me go on.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:05.580]   In addition to this sense of smallness and insignificance, there is also, isn't there,
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.780]   a sense of homelessness.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.420]   And it's a thing that this man brings out very prominently.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:18.780]   Yea, he says, at last the sparrow hath found a house.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.380]   The sparrow had been looking for this house for some time, and the swallow in the same
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:29.300]   way has at last found a nest for herself wherein she may lay her young.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.260]   She'd been flying about and looking for it.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.620]   That place seemed hopeful.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.620]   She went there.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.620]   No, it wasn't right.
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.980]   Tried another, and the poor swallow was beginning to think that she'd never find a place at
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:39.980]   all.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.420]   And likewise the little sparrow.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:52.940]   But at last the sparrow has found a house, and the swallow a place where she can build
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:59.580]   her little nest and bring up her young in the nest.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.580]   What's all this about?
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.500]   Well, I say, this is a wonderful picture again of a feeling that comes inevitably to every
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.340]   man who finally becomes a Christian.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:16.140]   It's this sense of homelessness, or to put it in other language, it is this great sense
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.700]   of restlessness.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.620]   Here we are, I say, in the world.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.980]   We find ourselves in it.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.140]   We haven't made the world.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.580]   We haven't made ourselves.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.180]   We just find ourselves in it.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.820]   We become aware of its greatness.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:36.820]   We become aware of other forces and factors, and we begin to ask certain questions.
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.700]   What is life?
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.740]   What are we doing here?
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.980]   What's the object and the purpose of it all?
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.700]   Where are we going?
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.500]   Is there any sense or meaning in it?
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.180]   Is there any final object to it all?
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.060]   What is life?
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:01.060]   And the moment you begin to face these questions, you are aware of this restlessness, this homelessness.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.180]   Well, the modern world is full of it.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.320]   I could illustrate it to you at very great length.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.460]   You see, it's because of this very restlessness that men and women are clutching at almost
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:17.220]   anything today in order to try and get a certain amount of peace and a certain amount of rest.
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:22.380]   That's why in an age like this, cults are popular.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:28.500]   You see, the old comfortable philosophy has been shattered by the two world wars.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:35.380]   Oh, there was a time, of course, before 1914, when on paper at Inuit a very good case could
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.900]   be made out for the fact that life at last had outgrown its growing pains and that men
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:46.140]   were settling down and that there was an era of great prosperity which probably would go
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:51.060]   on forever and ever and people getting to know one another would cease to hate one another
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.460]   and would banish war and all would be happy together and life would be harmonious.
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.620]   There seemed to be a great deal to be said for that, but oh, all that's gone.
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.580]   That illusion has been shattered and our whole life has been rocking and shaking and we don't
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.940]   know where we are.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.300]   We are seeking for rest and for peace.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:18.460]   There's a restlessness within.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:24.500]   You're aware, aren't you, of the new diseases that are coming heavily upon us?
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:30.980]   As these so-called miracle drugs cure the old infections and the old diseases one after
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.340]   another, so these other diseases are coming in.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.340]   What do they call them?
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:40.940]   Well, they're diseases of stress, strain.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:48.780]   These diseases of the heart, these diseases of like blood pressure, taut nerves, anxiety,
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.620]   neuroses and all these things, how common they're becoming.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.180]   It's becoming a great problem for the government and for the state.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.260]   Where can all these patients be housed?
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.860]   What are we to do with them?
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:06.980]   Well now, all this you see is a manifestation of this very restlessness which the psalmist
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.780]   describes so graphically to us.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.300]   He says, "I began to feel like a little sparrow.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.140]   I couldn't find a house for myself or I felt like a swallow.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.180]   I wished I could have found some place where I could have built my nest in safety and where
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.140]   I could have laid the eggs and brought up my young, but I couldn't find one.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.620]   And I was flying hither and thither and becoming weary and tired and I didn't know what to
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.500]   do with myself and what could I do?
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:39.420]   I flew helplessly, seeking and searching, I couldn't find."
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.940]   Have you known anything about that, my friend?
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.020]   You see, up until a certain point we don't think about these things at all, do we?
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.660]   We just eat and drink.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.940]   We go on from day to day and we never give a thought to any of these things at all.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:58.380]   But suddenly something will force us to do so, an illness or an accident or a death or
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:03.380]   some calamity, something happens and we begin to say, "Isn't there a place of rest?
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.460]   Isn't there somewhere where I can find a quiet heart?
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.180]   Isn't there some philosophy that can give me tranquility?"
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:14.160]   So we read the novels and they don't satisfy we see through them.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.300]   We say we're drugging ourselves intellectually.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.980]   We may try drink, we may try pleasure, we may take up politics, we may go in for social
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.900]   activities, we may take up a course on philosophy, we may take up a thousand and one things,
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:32.220]   art and music.
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:37.900]   But still there continues the restlessness.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:47.100]   These things seem to pass by and they leave the world to misery and to me.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:57.260]   The dance ends, the play ends, the music ends and you're left alone and you don't know quite
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.060]   where you are.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:06.700]   And you're wondering what you are and what you're destined for and what it's all about.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:11.700]   And you say, "I'd give the whole world if only I could find some place, some house,
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:19.220]   some resting place where there'd be an end to all this searching and seeking."
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.500]   Oh, my dear friends, read it for yourselves.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.660]   Read the confessions of a man like Saint Augustine and that's what he tells you that's what it's
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.660]   all about.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.100]   A brilliant man, great brain as he was, he couldn't find this place of rest.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.540]   He was like the little sparrow, like the swallow, flittering, flying ever and ever, thinking
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.540]   he'd got it and then he hadn't got it.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:44.260]   Finding another and again it was an illusion and on and on it goes.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:50.100]   No man, I say, has ever become a true Christian unless he has known this sense of restlessness,
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.540]   this feeling of homelessness.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.300]   He has an instinct within him which tells him, the homing instinct if you like, that
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.300]   there is a place if he could but find it but he cannot find it.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.420]   Well very well, there's the second thing, let me hurry to the third.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:11.340]   The third is this, a man who is a Christian, a man who enjoys the blessings of religion
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:17.500]   as this psalmist enjoyed them, is always a man who at the same time and for the reasons
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:26.740]   that I've been giving, becomes aware of his own helplessness, his own defenselessness.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.220]   These little birds have got it.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.420]   They know by a kind of instinct that there are certain enemies.
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:41.860]   There are larger birds, there are cats, there are mice, there are all these other beasts,
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.780]   these things that accompany them in creation, that are all watching them.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:51.140]   So they're concerned to find a place, a place of safety, a place beyond the reach of these
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.100]   enemies that are ever threatening them.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.540]   The little sparrow, have you ever watched a sparrow on a lawn?
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.260]   He's there pecking away at something and yet if there's the slightest movement, he jumps
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.260]   at once, he sees behind, he sees in front, he sees on the side, he sees...
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.260]   Have you ever seen a more nervous creature?
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.820]   His instinct is full of this sense of alarm and self-protection.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.380]   At any moment some predatory beast may descend upon him and he flits away.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:20.460]   The defenselessness for smallness, the utter helplessness of the little sparrow or the
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:25.900]   little swallow.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.660]   You know the tragedy of so many lives today is that men and women are not aware of these
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.660]   enemies.
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:37.580]   But I say the moment a man is on the way to being a Christian it's because he begins to
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.180]   become aware of this utter helplessness, this complete defenselessness of his.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.700]   What are these things that attack us?
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:48.100]   Well let me mention some of them.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.300]   Illness.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.220]   Only a man has gone through life without thinking at all until he's suddenly been stricken by
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.420]   an illness.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:02.300]   I've watched it so often.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:08.100]   People have even scoffed at me and my profession of the Christian faith and who haven't hesitated
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.540]   in various ways to tell me that they think I'm a fool.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:18.980]   Everything was all right.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:24.780]   Work or profession going well, no shortage of money, children, wife and children happy,
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.780]   everything perfect.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:34.660]   And they would regard me or any other Christian as just being morbid and introspective.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.540]   Why not enjoy life they say?
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.940]   Why live that miserable existence?
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.500]   Not aware you see of the enemies that were ready to pounce.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.380]   There they are on their lawns as if we're pecking away at their food and enjoying it
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.380]   tremendous.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.900]   Not aware of all the gathering and suddenly one strikes illness.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.900]   Accident.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:07.420]   Have I told you before how a great man, even a great man like the great Dr. Thomas Chalmers,
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.700]   one of the great preachers and teachers in the Church of Scotland in the last century,
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:18.260]   now he tells us that this was his position even as a Christian preacher for ten years.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.580]   He really wasn't a Christian preacher of course.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.940]   He didn't know this gospel.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.140]   He thought he did and he was perfectly happy.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:30.180]   He was a man who preached scientific sermons and he tells us that it took him to find himself
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:35.700]   on a bed for ten months, helpless and stricken, lying flat on his back.
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.420]   That awakened him and he found he'd got nothing.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.020]   He had nothing to fall back upon.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.540]   He was defenseless and he was quite helpless.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.860]   And accident I say and loss.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.300]   Or death may visit our family, death may threaten us.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:56.780]   And we're aware how small we are and how frail and how utterly helpless we are.
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.980]   These things come and we've got no reply and we can do nothing at all about them.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.740]   And we don't know what to do nor where to turn.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:11.340]   And then of course as we become more spiritual in our understanding, we become aware of the
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:21.940]   onslaughts that are made upon us by the world, by the flesh and by the devil.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:29.860]   We start off in life perhaps with high idealisms and wonderful visions and pictures.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:34.380]   As we say, have failed in the past but that's no reason why we should fail.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.300]   We are confident that we can handle ourselves in the situation, that we can go on and all
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.860]   is going to be well.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.180]   But the attack comes and suddenly we've lost something precious which we'd had until that
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.660]   moment, but it's gone.
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:53.140]   Chastity, purity, morality, honesty, certain things which we've priced so highly, they've
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.140]   gone.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.380]   They've been taken from us.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.620]   We are bereft of them.
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.740]   The enemy has come and has attacked and we didn't seem to have any means of defense,
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:07.660]   no means of protecting ourselves from the onslaught, the utter helplessness.
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:18.420]   Ah, you see it's only a man who begins to realize that he's got sin within him, who
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:25.060]   realizes that his very nature is twisted and perverted, that there is something wrong and
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:31.820]   foul in his own heart, and that in addition to that the whole world is set against him,
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:37.260]   and that the flesh is militating against him, and the devil behind it all.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.620]   He begins to see all these things and he's terrified.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.060]   He's afraid of himself.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.940]   He no longer says, "Let any temptation come and I can stand up to it."
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.460]   He discovers that that's the most dangerous thing in the world, that when he thought he
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.600]   was strong he suddenly went down.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.220]   He went out of his house determined never to fall again.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.380]   He'd fallen before he knew where he was.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:02.380]   He begins to realize how helpless he is, how utterly defenseless he is.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.660]   He is like that little sparrow.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.020]   He is like that little swallow.
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:12.180]   These other creatures are so mighty and strong.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.180]   Or let me ask a simple question.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.900]   Had you come to this realization?
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.620]   Have you known anything yet of the moral struggle?
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.700]   Have you known what it is to fight with all your might and yet go down with all these
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.860]   enemies that are attacking you?
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:39.780]   Now no man, I say, becomes a Christian without realizing something of his own weakness in
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.420]   this moral sense.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:48.340]   And he realizes the mighty power of evil, the power of sin within him and without him,
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.780]   the power of the devil, the power of hell.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:57.180]   And he realizes that the whole world is, as it were, set against him.
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:03.660]   The weakness, the helplessness, the defenselessness of the little bird.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.900]   And that brings me to the last thing that I've got to illustrate at this point, which
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.220]   is this.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.180]   And it's one of the most marvelous of all.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:21.740]   "Yea, the sparrow," he says, "hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself,
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.060]   where she may lay her young."
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.380]   Now these little birds have got this wonderful instinct.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:35.540]   They don't understand it intellectually, but they understand it instinctively and intuitively.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:41.620]   They know that the most marvelous thing that they can ever do is to bring up that young,
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:47.220]   to lay the eggs, to sit upon them and to hatch them and to bring up the young and to guard
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:51.340]   them and to feed them until that point when they've so developed and matured that they
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.780]   can fly over the edge of the nest themselves and begin their own life.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.540]   To the little bird there is nothing that is more precious than the young.
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.460]   And that is why the little bird is looking for a house or for a place where she may build
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:10.300]   her nest, that she may lay her young, the most priceless, the most precious possession
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:14.300]   of all.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.420]   What are you speaking of, says someone?
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:23.620]   Well, I'm just saying this.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:28.940]   The ultimate secret of every godly religious Christian man, the real secret of this psalmist
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:35.900]   as he puts it so plainly here is this, that he had come at last to realize that the most
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:41.660]   priceless thing in life was his soul.
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:48.580]   This is a son of King David, a mighty warrior, a man who slew Goliath, a man who could boast
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:53.260]   of many a victory won, who'd conquered his enemies, who was the greatest king that Israel
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.260]   ever knew.
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:59.980]   Here he is and he has great pomp and ceremony and many things about which men like to boast.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:05.980]   No, no, says David.
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:12.340]   I have discovered that the most priceless possession I have, though I'm a great king,
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.620]   is my soul.
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:23.980]   There is nothing more tender, there is nothing more precious than just this soul.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.780]   All these things he realizes I'll have to leave behind me, but there is that within
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.580]   me which is imperishable.
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.420]   There is this within me which goes on through all eternity.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.340]   It's the thing that God has put into me.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.620]   It's the thing that God breathed into man and he became a living soul.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.460]   It's the thing that stamps man as being made in the image of God.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:50.460]   My soul, the most precious thing of all, that's the thing that I want to save God and protect.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.380]   Would you like to hear the Apostle Paul saying the same thing?
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.340]   This is how he puts it.
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:07.340]   I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.860]   committed unto him against that day.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:16.820]   It's all right, says Paul, things are going against me, but I'm perfectly happy.
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.820]   Why?
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:22.460]   Because I have committed my soul and it's safe keeping to God and Christ and I know
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:28.020]   whatever may happen to me, he will keep that which I have committed unto him until that
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.300]   great day of judgment.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.980]   It's safe, I'm all right.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:40.260]   Do you remember how the Lord Jesus Christ put it?
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:45.220]   I read it to you just now after that sixth chapter of Matthew's Gospel.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.700]   He says, look here, don't waste your time in worrying about what you shall eat or what
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.700]   you shall drink or wherewithal you shall be clothed.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.500]   All the nations of the world are interested in these things.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.500]   The Gentiles go after things like that.
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.060]   Well, what are we to be worried about?
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.060]   Here it is.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:05.740]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you.
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.620]   Oh yes, the body is important, but not as important as the soul.
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:15.020]   What of your soul?
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:27.740]   What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:31.100]   Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.740]   Ah, says David, I'm like the little sparrow in the swallow.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.780]   I've got the most priceless possession.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.620]   In their case it's the young, in mine it's the soul.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.180]   And I've awakened to this my soul.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:46.380]   Where can I put it that I may know it is safe with all these enemies attacking and life
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.380]   being what it is?
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:52.580]   Is there no place where I may know that my soul is safe for all eternity?
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.460]   That's what I want to know.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:04.340]   And you see, these are all the inevitable steps, are they not, that cause us all to
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:08.740]   seek and to search for salvation.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:14.860]   You awaken to the fact that there is this soul within you, that when your body is mouldering
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:21.100]   and there in the grave becoming nothing, eaten of worms and disappearing, that this precious,
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:26.620]   priceless thing is going on and will go on and on and on and there's no end to it.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:30.620]   Oh, the safety of the soul, that's the ultimate question.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.540]   Have you become concerned about your soul?
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.860]   Have you become alarmed about your soul?
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.940]   Have you realized that you'll have to give to God an account of your soul and what you've
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.980]   done with it in this world?
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.300]   Very well then, here is the need that the man depicts in terms of the sparrow and the
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.300]   swallow.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.580]   But thank God he puts it positively.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.220]   The sparrow hath found a house.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:59.860]   The swallow hath found a nest for herself where she may lay her young.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.660]   And this is the glory of the Christian gospel.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:07.500]   It satisfies these four needs that I've been putting before you.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:15.980]   It's all found in the gospel, isn't it?
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:22.620]   In a most interesting way, our Lord seems to have put it as a direct answer to the questions
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:23.620]   of this psalmist.
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.700]   Do you remember how he put it?
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.900]   He said this, he said, "Look here, don't be worried and troubled about yourselves."
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:37.180]   He says, "Not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your heavenly Father knowing
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.180]   it."
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.220]   And then he says, "How much better are ye than many sparrows?"
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:45.860]   He says another time, "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:52.180]   And yet your heavenly Father careth for them?"
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:39:00.420]   How much greater, he asks, is his concern and his care for you?
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.580]   Have you felt that you're just like a little sparrow in this world?
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:09.820]   Have you said to yourself, "Well, I'm such a small little being and individual and entity.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.180]   How can I matter in this great world with its teeming masses and so on?"
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.020]   My dear friend, let me give you the answer to it.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.020]   Here it is.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:24.340]   One afternoon, you know, our Lord was going at the request of a great man called Jairus
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.940]   to see the little daughter of Jairus who'd been very ill and who'd died.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.660]   And our Lord was hurrying along to the house to help them.
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.980]   Suddenly he was thronged by a great crowd.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:39.740]   They were there literally surrounding him and pressing in upon him so that they could
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.500]   scarcely move.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:48.460]   Suddenly our Lord astonished his disciples by saying, "Who touched me?"
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:55.220]   And the disciples turned to him in astonishment and said, "Master, the crowd is thronging
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.620]   thee and sayest thou, 'Who touched me?'
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.060]   Why men, a thousand people are touching you."
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:09.260]   "No, no," says Christ, "I'm asking, 'Who touched me?'"
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:16.020]   And a poor woman in the great crowd stepped forward and said, so ashamed of herself that
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:21.900]   she could scarcely lift up her head, she said, "I touched you.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.220]   And in it I touched the hem of your garment.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.860]   I touched him."
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.900]   Yes, she'd touched him in her desperate and awful need.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:35.380]   And here's the thing, you see, that though he was thronged by a great crowd, the Son
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.660]   of God knew of the individual.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:43.620]   The lonely woman with the issue of blood whom nobody could heal, the physicians couldn't
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:47.660]   help, the one isolated individual in the mob, "Who touched me?"
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:51.780]   He knew.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.340]   And that is still the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:59.300]   Though you're one of the teeming masses in this world, and though the world would
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:04.140]   have you believe that you don't count you but a speck in the mass, God says, "I know
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.140]   you."
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:11.020]   Or if you like, look at it in that other incident at the end of our Lord's life.
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:17.580]   There he is dying on the cross, enduring that agony and that shame and all the rest of it,
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:22.820]   and the thief on one side says, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:23.820]   And he did.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.300]   He'd got time for him.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.340]   Though he was bearing the sins of the world, and though he was experiencing things that
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:34.020]   you and I can never imagine, he was ready to listen to the isolated cry.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:40.260]   This one man, he gave himself to him exclusively, as it were, and gave him the glorious promise,
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:46.020]   "This day thou shalt be with me in paradise."
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:51.340]   My dear friend, this is the glorious message of this gospel.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:56.420]   God who made the worlds and the stars and the constellations, this majestic Lord of
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:02.780]   hosts, whose name this man celebrates sometimes, do you know he knows you?
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:09.900]   He's interested in us one by one, the sparrow, the swallow.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.460]   Never again listen to that lie of the devil.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.420]   You'll find rest in this gospel.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:21.380]   You will know that the maker of heaven and earth is interested in you, and sent his Son
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:26.580]   into the world for you, and likewise with our second problem.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.940]   Have you been seeking for rest?
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.220]   Well, I've already given you the answer to that.
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:39.100]   The Son of God stood up and he said, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:46.620]   laden, and I will give you rest."
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.500]   Have you tried the way of the world?
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.620]   Have you tried its pleasure, its laughter?
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:56.260]   Have you tried its philosophy, its thinking, its art, and all its culture?
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:00.500]   Have you been trying to find some place where you can find rest for your souls?
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:05.540]   Oh, I say again, and it's my privilege to remind you, there's only one place in the
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.060]   universe you'll find it.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:10.340]   It's the altar.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.440]   It is only as you look at him there dying on that cross that you'll find rest and peace
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:21.800]   for your soul, for there he tells you this, "Strive no more, make no more effort.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.420]   It isn't your seeking that will enable you to find.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:31.420]   Come unto me, just as you are in your failure, in your helplessness, in your restlessness.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:38.300]   Come unto me and I will give you rest."
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:46.900]   The sparrow has found a house and the swallow a place wherein she may make her nest and
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.500]   lay her young.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:54.740]   The rest and the peace and the quiet that the gospel give, the end of the seeking and
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:44:00.100]   the striving, the finding.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:05.580]   And then, of course, the safety and the protection.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.060]   This man puts it in his own words.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:19.260]   He says, "The Lord God is a sun and shield, a light in darkness, a shield to protect."
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:26.460]   Do you know anybody or anything that can protect you from the world and the flesh and the devil?
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:27.460]   What can you do?
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:32.340]   What can the world do against these forces and powers that are trying to rob you and
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.580]   destroy your soul?
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.220]   There is only one answer again.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:45.580]   The Lord Jesus Christ said, using another analogy, comparing us to sheep and calling
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:52.620]   himself the Good Shepherd, he said, "No man shall be able to pluck them out of my
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.180]   hand."
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:45:00.500]   With the power of the Lord Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit we can say, "I need thee
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.500]   every hour.
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.500]   Stay thou not nearby."
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.500]   Why?
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.620]   Well, temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.660]   "With thee at hand I fear no foe.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.660]   With thee at hand to bless."
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:19.180]   The strength, the power of Christ, he surrounds us.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:22.580]   The name of the Lord is a strong tower.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:30.620]   "Yea," he says, "the apostle Paul, I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:38.020]   angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:45.260]   depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.060]   is in Christ Jesus."
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.380]   We are safe in the nest and no animal can come there.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.380]   We are protected.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.380]   We are surrounded.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.380]   We are safe.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:46:03.260]   Nothing and no one shall ever be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.060]   Jesus our Lord.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:18.060]   And then finally, the young, the most priceless possession of all, the soul.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.900]   "Oh, where can I find safety for my soul?
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.620]   I have already been answering the question.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.140]   There is only one place.
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:40.300]   The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:49.100]   The Christ who died for us and for our sins, the Christ who saved us, is the Christ who
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.900]   will continue to keep us.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.060]   He will be with us to the river.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.780]   He will never leave us nor forsake us.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:04.340]   He will be with us in the river and beyond it.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:15.340]   He will take us by the hand and present us faultless in the presence of God's glory
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:20.180]   with exceeding joy all the way.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:23.620]   My Savior leads me.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.860]   What am I to ask beside?
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:35.100]   Can I doubt his tender mercy who through life has been my guide?
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:41.260]   Heavenly peace, divinest comfort, here my faith in him to dwell.
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:52.420]   For I know what e'er befall me, Jesus doeth all things well.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:48:03.820]   He has died to save your soul and he will keep it safely through all eternity.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.540]   Yea, yea!
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:21.700]   The sparrow has found a house and the swallow a nest wherein she may lay her young.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:29.660]   My dear friend, have you found it?
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:35.980]   Can you take your stand by the side of the psalmist and say, "Yes, it's perfectly
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:36.980]   true.
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:43.140]   I have found my every need satisfied.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:50.140]   The almighty God in heaven is interested in me and knows me.
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:55.940]   He is my God and I am his child.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:01.180]   And my soul is safe in the keeping of Christ.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:13.340]   A sovereign protector I have unseen yet forever attend, unchangeably faithful to save, almighty
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.860]   to rule and commend.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.820]   He smiles and my comforts abound.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:29.500]   His grace like the dew shall descend and walls of salvation surround the soul.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.740]   He delights to defend.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.300]   Are you in the nest?
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.420]   Have you found the house?
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:47.900]   Can you say, "Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee."
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.460]   That's the way.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.740]   Enter into it.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.700]   Amen.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.620]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
