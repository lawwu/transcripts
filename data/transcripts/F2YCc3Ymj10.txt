[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   Well, what's next for an old pastor?
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.800]   We get this question on occasion.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.360]   Here's the most recent one, an email.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.200]   "Hello Pastor John, I'm 51 years old and have pastored the same church for 17 years.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.040]   I love being a pastor and I wish I could never retire from this work, but I know this is
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.840]   probably not the best idea for the long-term health of my church.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.560]   My question is this, what happens to us old pastors?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960]   What should happen to us?
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.440]   I don't have a ministry like yours, I can't publish a book any publisher would want, and
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.680]   I get no invitations to speak at conferences.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160]   What work is there left for me to do?"
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.760]   Well, I think often about this question, probably because of my age, 74, and the fact that I'm
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.140]   indeed privileged to be part of a ministry that grew up alongside me while I was pastoring.
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.980]   But I often imagine what it would be like, what I would be doing if there were no one
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.400]   giving me structure to my life and expecting me to earn my salary at Desiring God.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.300]   This is the position of thousands of pastors who finished their pastorate at 65 or 70 or
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.300]   75.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.940]   They have good years left, but what should they do?
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.200]   And the first thing I want to say is foundational, and then more specific.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.660]   Don't believe in the world's view of retirement, which usually revolves around recreation,
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.940]   fishing, golfing, cruises, resorts, shopping.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.040]   There's not anything like that in the Bible.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.380]   Ponder for 40 or 50 years and then indulge yourself with worldly leisure and play for
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.600]   the last chapter of your life as you prepare to give an account to the judge of the universe
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.000]   while putting all the accumulated knowledge that God has given you over the years on the
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.500]   shelf unused.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.500]   That's insane.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.200]   It's not biblical, and we are being duped by the world to buy into it, I fear.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.720]   So Paul came to the end of his life saying, "I am ready to be poured out as a drink
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.040]   offering.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.200]   The time of my departure has come.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.560]   I have fought the good fight.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.080]   I have finished the race.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.360]   I have kept the faith.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.760]   Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.240]   judge, will award me on that day, and not only to me, but also to all who have loved
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   his appearing."
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.960]   That's 2 Timothy 4, 6-8.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.160]   The race that he's talking about, the race of life, the race of ministry, did not end
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.560]   for Paul till he hit the finish line.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.320]   And the finish line was death.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.600]   The final bell in the fight that he was fighting, that final bell is rung at death.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.520]   So the foundational thing I want to say is this.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.920]   Don't think in terms of retirement.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:11.560]   Think of pulling back from one kind of ministry when the time seems right, but pursuing other
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.240]   ministry when that happens.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.080]   And I think it's possible for anybody and everybody.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.360]   And I'm tempted to list here formal kinds of ministry like interim pastorate, staff
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.480]   positions in senior care, diaconal services for the sick, counseling, discipling young
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.920]   men, serving in an inner city, service ministry, doing more extensive evangelism, and on and
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920]   on and on.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.760]   Missions of all kinds would be happy to take a 70-year-old to do certain things.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.960]   I'm tempted to go there, which I just did, but I'll stop.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.920]   It seems to me that the real issue is, are you committed to what Paul calls abounding
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.280]   in the work of the Lord?
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.600]   That's a phrase from 1 Corinthians 15, 58, which is not addressed to vocational ministers,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.000]   but to the church as a whole in Corinth.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.840]   It's based on the hope of the entire chapter of the resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15, not
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.400]   the hope of retirement.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.040]   Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.880]   the Lord, always abounding, abounding, abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.080]   Lord your labor is not in vain.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.680]   So abounding in the work of the Lord means doing lots and lots of it.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.800]   That's what abounding means, filling our days with work that has the Lord as its conscious
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.040]   source and the Lord as its conscious goal.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.720]   That's the work of the Lord.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.640]   And what I would want to say to every pastor coming to the end of his pastoral years is,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:59.320]   are you steadfastly committed not to drift, not to coast into heaven?
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.040]   Are you saying with Paul, forgetting what lies behind?
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:11.040]   Now, for me, that would mean don't begin to sit on the laurels of 33 years of pastoral
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.440]   ministry and try to sort out how good or bad it was.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.000]   Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, are you pressing
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.360]   on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus?
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:33.000]   So my suggestion is that you mainly think not in terms of formal ministry with a title,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   though that's great.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.200]   If a door opens, do it.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.240]   But that you mainly think of what the New Testament calls "good works."
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.360]   These were mainly efforts on the part of ordinary Christians to do some good for others.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.920]   It may have been very individual, personal, or it may have been that it developed into
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:04.200]   a very significant caring institution like orphanage or hospital or school or recovery
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.520]   center or emergency shelter, whatever.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:17.040]   But mainly, the emphasis in the New Testament was Christians have in us an impulse to do
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.080]   lots and lots and lots of good.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.840]   We get up in the morning, I want to do something good for somebody today.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.280]   I'm not content to sit around and watch TV or play games.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.200]   There is in me this Holy Spirit-given energy.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.700]   I want to do some good in the world.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:42.680]   So I would say ponder often texts like Hebrews 10.24, "Let us consider how to stir one
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.800]   another up to love and good works," or Titus 3.14, "Let our people learn to devote
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.080]   themselves to good works so as to help causes of urgent need and not be unfruitful," or
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   Titus 3.8, "I want you to insist on these things so that those who have believed in
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.400]   God may be careful to devote themselves to good works."
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.080]   These things are excellent and profitable for people.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:17.160]   Or Titus 2.14, "Christ gave himself"—this is amazing—"Christ gave himself for us
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.880]   to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people who are zealous for good
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   works."
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.400]   He died so that so-called retired pastors would be full of good works.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.920]   Or Ephesians 2.10, "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works."
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.720]   That's why you're made, and you didn't stop being made for this when you turned 70.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:49.960]   Let me close by doing for you or for pastors in general who are approaching this transition
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.320]   what a wise father in the faith did for me when I was 28 years old.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.520]   I was jobless.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.640]   I was eager for ministry and had no place calling me, and he wrote to me.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.000]   I was in Germany at the time, so it was hard to make contacts with people back in America.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.400]   And I wasn't sure what I was going to do.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.720]   I had a wife and a child to support, and there were no doors opening.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.680]   What am I going to do?
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.720]   And he wrote to me, and he said, "Read 2 Corinthians 4.1 in the Greek, and what you'll
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.320]   notice is this.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:30.120]   'Therefore, having this ministry,'" and then he translated it this way, "'just as we received
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.120]   mercy.'"
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.680]   "Having this ministry, just as we received mercy, we do not lose heart."
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:45.640]   And he said in the letter, "Just as we receive mercy" means that just as God was merciful,
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:54.480]   John, to save you and keep you, so he will mercifully give you a ministry.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.680]   And I was so helped by that in my faith.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.320]   Yes, amen.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:06.520]   If your heart is all in to fill your days with good works as God has given you gifts
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:13.620]   and health, God will not leave you without a significant work to do.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.400]   He does not waste his children.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:24.560]   I think 2 Corinthians 9.8 carries the implication not only of God's supply of grace to have
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.480]   what we need for good work, but to have the good work itself.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.040]   So I'll read it.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:39.720]   And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that having all sufficiency in all
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:46.720]   things at all times, you may abound in every good work.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   Amen.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.920]   Thank you, Pastor John, for giving hope to so many men nearing the end of their pastorates.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.720]   It's a wise word.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.440]   Well, whether you listen in the car, at the gym, doing chores, thanks for inviting us
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440]   into your day.

[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.720]   Another question we haven't gotten to yet in APJ.
