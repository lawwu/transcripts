[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Podcast listener Zach Howell writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, is it okay to
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.600]   come to the Lord with a heart that is weary, beaten down, broken down, and
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.700]   joyless? Will He take you in without joy?"
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.840]   Here's what Jesus says, "All that the Father gives me will come to me, and
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:37.120]   whoever comes to me I will never cast out." Or in another place, "Come to me all
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.640]   who labor and are heavy laden." I think that's exactly the situation that Zach is
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.600]   describing. "And I will give you rest." Or again, "Whoever comes to me shall not
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:01.000]   hunger." Jesus is honored when we come to Him for help. And in Zach's case, the help
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.960]   he needs is help to have joy again. Help not to be weary and broken down and
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.880]   without joy. Our joy—this is crucial—our joy does not happen away from
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.000]   Jesus so that it can function as a ticket to Jesus. See, the question is kind
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.800]   of posed like, "If I don't have it, can I go get it?" Well, our joy happens with
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.960]   Jesus. The reason any of us comes to Jesus is because He is the joy we seek.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.080]   We don't get it somewhere else and then come and say, "I've got it,
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.520]   Jesus, and can I come now?" No, we come to get it because He is it. So the psalmist
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.000]   prays like this, "Restore to me the joy of your salvation. Uphold me with a
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.360]   willing spirit." He's coming to God saying clearly, "I've lost my joy, and I know
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.800]   you're the only true source of it, so I'm coming to you. Please restore it as I
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.680]   come." Or that was Psalm 51. Here's Psalm 85, "Will you not revive us again that
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.920]   your people may rejoice in you?" So we're like dead men. We need reviving. We need
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.280]   life, and the effect of this life will be joy. What kind of joy? In you. Rejoice in
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:48.040]   you. We come to you lifeless and joyless so that you will give life, and that life
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.400]   will spring up with joy. And one more, "Gladden the soul of your servant." This
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.040]   is Psalm 86, "Gladden the soul of your servant, for to you, O Lord, I lift up my
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:08.840]   soul." So he's seeking gladness. So he lifts up his soul to God. It's like
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.680]   lifting up the empty cup from someone 16. I will lift up the cup of salvation and
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.880]   call upon the name of the Lord. My cup is empty, Lord. I've poured it out. I've
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.160]   done all I can do. I need gladness, so I come to you and lift up my soul for
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:35.160]   refreshment. So my answer is, "Yes, Zach, it is okay to come to God without any
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:43.480]   perceived affection of joy, not because joylessness is good, and not because
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.000]   joylessness is acceptable. What is good and acceptable is the glory that God
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.640]   gets when we declare that we are done with all the failing pleasures of the
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.760]   slums of sin and acknowledge that God is the fountain of life, and when we
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.960]   come to him for joy and rest, no matter what it costs. So the motive for coming
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:16.880]   is not based on prior experiences of joy in God. The motive for coming is, "He is
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.000]   the fountain of life. I have need. He has fullness. I will glorify his fullness by
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.120]   coming to him for joy." Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Zach.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.840]   So is joy in God to be waited for or to be pursued by us? We tackled that
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.520]   related question way back in episode number 20. You can find it in the podcast
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.600]   archive, most easily found in the app for the iPhone and the Android. Again, that's
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.400]   episode number 20. Like Zach, if you have a question for Pastor John, please email
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.640]   it in to us at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org, and visit us online at
