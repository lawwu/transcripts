[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   I'm Cal Newport and this is deep questions episode 205
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.560]   I'm here in my deep work
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.240]   HQ and by myself no, Jesse
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.040]   Jesse's on vacation down in Florida
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.840]   Quick public service announcement just about what to expect
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.740]   For the midsummer episodes of this show Jesse is gone today. So he's not going to be here on this taping
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.180]   Then I'm going on vacation once he returns
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.320]   So what you should expect if all goes well and I'm knocking on wood here in the HQ is
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.240]   Next week's episode will be recorded by me in an undisclosed location up in the
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.920]   Mountains of New England. I'm bringing a microphone with me. I'm going to try to
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.880]   record
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.960]   Outside what's the painting expression plin d'air?
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.920]   French expression gonna record outside. Maybe I'll have some meditations on life in the woods or something similarly deep or
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.120]   More likely it'll be like a normal episode but with worse sound quality and a lot of annoying
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.080]   Animal sounds in the background then the week after that
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.280]   There is a an interview I recorded actually back in December. It's a digital
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.760]   Minimalism case study. It's a two-part interview. I combined kind of an interesting experimental idea. I had for an episode
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.560]   Jesse's editing that up and and we're gonna release that two weeks from now and
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.520]   Going forward from there. It'll just be normal episodes
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.320]   Recorded back in the HQ with Jesse. Sorry
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.680]   so this is one of three episodes will be a little bit different because of
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.560]   Vacations now what I like to do when Jesse is not here is try things different
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.840]   It's a time to experiment and what I thought I would do for today's episode is let's get back to basics
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.920]   I don't know how to operate all the fancy stuff. Jesse does so no news reactions. No split screens. No calls. I gathered ten
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.620]   Questions ten questions one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight nine ten
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.180]   I just want to rock and roll through ten questions one after another and see if we can do some damage get back to our roots
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.700]   It's just seeing question answer question see question answer question. So that is my challenge in
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.180]   today's episode
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.260]   Is to get through ten questions. All right, let me talk briefly about a sponsor
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.100]   That's going to make this cavalcade of question answering possible and that is our good friends at my body
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.660]   tutor
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.620]   My body tutor is a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.620]   which is the lack of
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.300]   consistency
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.740]   They do this by simplifying the process into practical sustainable behaviors and then giving you daily accountability and support
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.340]   So you stick with your plan when you use my body tutor?
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.180]   you are assigned a coach this coach comes up with a plan for you and
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.840]   Your goals for eating for exercise for movement you then log your food log your exercise
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.260]   In an app every day the coach sees it gets back to you gives you feedback gives you encouragement
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.580]   Helps you stay on the right path. It is a great way to get in shape
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.740]   Now here's the thing. I've known Adam Gilbert the founder of my body tutor for a long time
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.940]   He used to be the fitness advice guy on my study hacks blog years ago
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.420]   So because of that he is going to give deep questions
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.300]   Listeners $50 off their first month if you mentioned a podcast when you join
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.780]   All right, so mention deep questions when you join and Adam will give you
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.580]   $50 off your first month
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.020]   Now, of course, what is the point of trying to get in shape if you're not sleeping?
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.500]   Well, this is where our sponsor ate sleep is
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.580]   Something that can help
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.960]   More than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep and temperature is one of their main concerns. It is certainly a concern of mine
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.780]   I have a hard time
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.820]   Sleeping when I'm hot on our vacation. We're leaving for in a couple days. I will be bringing
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.620]   Many fans to help ensure that I am NOT too hot when I sleep
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:21.060]   If you like me are a hot sleeper, then I need to recommend the eight sleep pod pro cover
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.460]   It is the most advanced solution on the market for
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.740]   Regulation it pairs dynamic cooling and heating with biometric tracking you can add the cover to any mattress and start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.180]   Or as hot as 100 and agree 10 degrees
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.820]   Fahrenheit you can even adjust
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:44.900]   Both sides of your bed differently in case your partner has different preferences than you with that sleep temperature
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.460]   It sleep users fall asleep up to 32% faster
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.460]   Their sleep interruptions are reduced by 40% and they get overall more restful sleep
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.100]   I am a fan of eight sleep because I am a fan of sleeping cool
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.900]   So go to eight sleep comm slash deep to check out the pod pro cover and you will save
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.660]   $150 at checkout, but that's only if you go to eight sleep comm
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.340]   Deep eight sleep currently ships within the US Canada and the UK
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.100]   All right, let us get into it with some questions
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.740]   Question number one comes from Dan
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:33.020]   Dan says I'm currently pursuing a degree in computer science and I'm having trouble finding time to do a much-needed
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.860]   self-study in
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.620]   Parentheses Dan says what I learned in college is nowhere near enough in parentheses
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.860]   How much self-studying do you recommend and how do you fit in with all of the schoolwork?
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.980]   without getting
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.300]   overwhelmed
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.380]   Okay. Well
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.700]   I'm
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.700]   Not exactly sure
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:02.020]   What self-study refers to here? Do you mean you're not learning enough in the classroom to actually?
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.780]   Succeed in your computer science classes or do you mean there is topics you want to learn in general and you're not able to satisfy
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.660]   That through your college curriculum
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.460]   either way
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.060]   Either way, we have a more general challenge here
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:24.540]   Which is you have an intellectual pursuit that is separate from your direct course responsibilities that you want to fit into your college life
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.540]   I am familiar with this. I
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.980]   had my share of
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:36.140]   Independent intellectual pursuits when I was a college student. I wrote my first book how to become know how to win at college
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.660]   How to win at college. I wrote that during my senior year at Dartmouth
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.100]   I also edited a magazine and was a opinion columnist for a while
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:52.180]   While at school, so I'm used to this idea of having non class intellectual but non class related work to do while in college
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.900]   And so here's a few things to recommend to make that work one. Keep your course load reasonable. I
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.220]   Used to do a lot of work on
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:08.420]   student stress and reducing student stress and I can tell you one of the biggest cause of student stress, especially at elite schools is students had
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.140]   Course loads that were too heavy
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.860]   Double majors major into minors trying to fit in an extra course three or four really hard courses push together
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.380]   This is a problem if
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.820]   Your schedule is too hard your entire semester is going to be difficult
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:31.340]   so you want to have the most reasonable possible schedule in terms of both the overall difficulty and the
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.740]   diversity of different course types
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.260]   not all quantitative not all
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.860]   Humanities focused balance types keep the course load
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.420]   reasonable
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.780]   If you have a lot of credits coming into college
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.620]   I did some of this
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.580]   Cash that in later in your career to maybe have an independent study or just to take a lighter course load one year
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:57.220]   Keep your course loads reasonable. It is the most effective thing you can do to reduce stress. I think students get
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.540]   What I used to call heart attack semesters on my study hacks blog back in the day
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.740]   They would get into these hard scheduling situations either because they weren't paying attention
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.900]   When they're setting up their schedule there's trying to solve problems
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.100]   Well, I need this requirement and dad. Why don't I get this out of my way? That sounds interesting
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.540]   there's not paying attention to the impact of
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.260]   their choices or
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.780]   They're laboring under the delusion that the harder their schedule somehow the more
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.140]   Impressive that will make them a lot of college students labor under this delusion that there is a
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:34.020]   College admission style committee in their future that's going to look at their schedule and say how many things did Dan do how hard was?
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.500]   Dan scheduled to figure out whether or not to let them in that doesn't happen after college
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.380]   That's not the way job interviews work. That's not the way you move through the professional world. No one cares that your
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:49.820]   Sophomore fall semester was really difficult. No one will even notice you suffer that pain you get very few benefits for it
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:55.500]   So make your course load easier Dan if you want to do extra work
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.540]   If you're doing extra work treat it like a major extracurricular
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.740]   Meaning don't have many other major extracurricular pursuits. This should be one of them
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.260]   don't be trying to edit a magazine and
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.100]   Writing for the paper and being a part of the dance team and do major self-study
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.580]   You actually have to treat it with respect if it's one of the things you're working on
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.500]   Don't put too many other extracurriculars onto your schedule and finally
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.820]   leverage autopilot schedules
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.780]   Big piece of advice I give the college students for every work that happens regularly. I
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:35.660]   Always have this reading assignment in this English class. I always have a weekly problem set in this computer science class
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.300]   For work that happens regularly
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:44.460]   Figure out when and where each week that work gets done this day this time then this location
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.420]   That's when I do the first half of my reading this day this time this location. That's when I do the second half
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.860]   My problem set I always do one hour right after the class when it's assigned
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.500]   I go to the library right next to the classroom and I prep it I go through the problems
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.660]   I see which ones I know how to solve which ones look hard
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.820]   Then I have a meeting with my problem set group. We always do that the next night at 7
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.100]   Here in the study room that we have a reservation for and then I have a two-hour block
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.460]   I always put together the next morning to clean up what we did and write it up
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.140]   Whatever. These are sample schedules, but it's the same time same day same places
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.340]   It's an autopilot schedule because it makes you not have to actually
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.480]   Think and make decisions about when and where you're going to work. Should I work now?
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.480]   What should I work on today? It's all made
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.020]   automatic
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.200]   Automatic so autopilot schedule your schoolwork add the self-studying to the autopilot schedule
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:43.340]   That is how I wrote how to win a college my senior year 90 minutes first thing in the morning. Everyone was still asleep. I
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:50.380]   Remember the Wheeler apartments for Dartmouth people. I was in a Wheeler apartments with a couple buddies of mine
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.340]   How it tipped to John?
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.660]   Who else was in that apartment Lee maybe hat tip to Lee? I don't quite remember everyone who was there, but I had a
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:06.220]   Room with a radiator that would spit hot water into the air because this was very old heating technology
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.220]   And there was one of those old-fashioned
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.840]   Overpolished varnish
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.600]   Indestructible college desks in the room. I would get up go to the desk and I would write 90 minutes weekday mornings
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.840]   Repeat the book was written
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.140]   All right, Dan. So I used your question as an excuse to go broader
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.520]   To some of my more general thoughts about getting through college
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.840]   All right, we got next question here from Sam
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.880]   Sam who doesn't seem too happy with me says isn't it a bit too selfish and myopic
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:45.760]   To make it so difficult for others to reach you and make them work with you on your terms while disregarding
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.880]   others needs
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.440]   Sam I don't have time to answer your question right now. What I need you to do is
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.880]   Engrave it if you could I'm talking about four by two by one inch pine
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.680]   Preferably engrave it in that and I want you to mail it to me
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.460]   And if you can mail it to me needs to get here on a Wednesday
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:13.380]   Then maybe I will answer your request. The answer though is going to come three to six months later. It will be
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.960]   Via perrier-kitchen. I
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.320]   Just mix those up
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.400]   Carrier pigeon I said perrier-kitchen
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:28.840]   When Jesse's not here I get a little punchy. All right, Sam, I'm being facetious there. Your question has two interpretations
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:36.920]   So, I don't know if you're talking about it being selfish myopic to be hard to reach as let's say public facing media figure
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.480]   So thinking about the way people reach me as an author a podcaster, etc
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.160]   Or are you referring to some of the rules and things I talk about in books like?
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.320]   Deep work and a world without email about being more careful about communication protocols. It's just an individual
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.080]   Someone who's more careful about how do they communicate with their colleagues or their friends, etc
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:02.160]   To prevent their life being constant context shifts and distractions. So these are two different areas
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:08.360]   You could be referring to being hard to reach as a media figure or as an individual both are interesting
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:15.920]   So let's cover both. Let's start with media figure. I am hard to reach as a media figure. I'm not on
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.280]   Social media so you can't throw messages my way. I don't have general-purpose
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.040]   email addresses
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.720]   There's particular addresses for particular things with rules about what you should expect or not
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:36.120]   Expect a lot of requests go straight to publicist or agents, etc. So I am kind of purposely hard to reach
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   Now my motivation for why that's reasonable
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:46.400]   Really came from author Neil Stevenson's famous essay why I am a bad
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.320]   Correspondent now Sam if you will indulge me. I
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.160]   Want to read some excerpts?
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.880]   I'm gonna read some excerpts from this essay and then give you my my personal take on how I put this
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.440]   Into action in my own life. So here's what Neil says and I'm skipping things. So these are just parts of his essay
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:13.140]   Writers who do not make themselves totally available to everyone all the time are frequently tagged with the recluse label
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:19.540]   Well, I do not consider myself a recluse. I have found it necessary to place some limits on my direct interactions with
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.720]   individual readers
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:27.540]   These limits most often come into play when people send me letters or email and also when I am invited to speak publicly
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.680]   This document is a sort of form letter explaining why I am the way I am
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.020]   like dot dot dot Stevenson goes on later to say
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:41.660]   Writing novels is hard and requires vast unbroken slabs of time
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.200]   For quiet hours is a resource that I can put to good use
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:52.820]   Two slabs of time each two hours long might add up to the same four hours, but are not nearly as productive as an unbroken
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.560]   for
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.560]   men, sir Stevenson
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.080]   If I know that I'm going to be interrupted I can't concentrate and if I suspect that I might be interrupted
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.040]   I can't do anything at all
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.200]   likewise
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:10.500]   Several consecutive days with four hour time slabs in them gives me a stretch of time in which I can write a decent book chapter
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.760]   But the same number of hours spread across a few weeks with interruptions in between are nearly
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:20.360]   Useless the productivity equation is a nonlinear one. In other words
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.920]   This accounts for why I'm a bad
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:28.040]   Correspondent and why I very rarely accept speaking engagements if I organize my life in such a way that I get
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.800]   Lots of long consecutive uninterrupted time chunks. I can write novels
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.400]   But as those chunks get separated and fragmented my productivity as a novelist drops
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:44.880]   Spectacularly what replaces it instead of a novel that will be around for a long time and that will with luck be read by many
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:51.960]   People there's a bunch of email messages that I have sent out to individual persons and a few speeches given at various conferences
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.200]   All right. I mean I read that early on and my career as a writer is very influential
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   You could definitely see ideas from that
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.580]   Showing up or being echoed in deep work. I quote this essay in deep work
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.100]   These ideas have also come up in my subsequent writing about distraction as well
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:16.400]   Stevenson I think is making the right point for public facing figures. The productivity equation is
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.240]   nonlinear
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:25.080]   if I can just have time to think and write write my books write my articles and
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.680]   Talk to you folks here through the podcast microphone. I can reach lots of people
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.160]   I can do my best work if I instead am easier to reach I can talk to a lot of individual people
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:42.880]   That leaves me with a history of individual back-and-forth conversations as Stevenson goes on to say of mediocre value
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.000]   Reaching many fewer people than being able to actually put work out into the larger public sphere
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.920]   So I agree with Neil with that now. I remember vividly when I had to make this transition. I
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.480]   Was a graduate student at MIT
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   I had written three books
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:04.080]   Aimed at students. I was running the study hacks blog and newsletter, which at the time was very student focused. I
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.300]   Had really enjoyed during my time at MIT
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.480]   Having an open email address where students would send me
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.560]   questions about what I was writing about and I would answer the students questions and I really felt like it was
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:24.960]   Almost a philanthropic investment of my time. I could help dozens of real students with real issues and it was very satisfying
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   and
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.680]   There was a selfish component to it as well because I would learn from these questions
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.640]   What was really affecting people what was really going on?
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.840]   It was my intelligence networking to the life of students and it would evolve what I wrote about
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.440]   if you go back and look at my first books and
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.740]   Very early study hacks post you'll see they're very tactical
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.520]   How do you study? How do you manage your time?
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:54.440]   My whole focus shifted to be much more emphasizing of stress student stress and overload and burnout
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.440]   Where did that shift come from?
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:05.620]   Hundreds of these emails just hearing. Oh, what is really affecting people what these elite schools? It's not just that there's time management system
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:11.680]   Needs a tune-up. They're overwhelmed. They're stressed. They don't know why they're there. So it was very important to me
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.640]   the problem is dozens became hundreds and
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.080]   They're long messages
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:24.040]   I mean people are pouring out their life story and their issues and their caveats and their parents and what's happening with their
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:29.920]   Boyfriends or girlfriends? I mean these long life stories and I ran out of time and I and I
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.040]   Remember thinking I can't do this halfway
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.800]   I can't answer a few people's questions and let the let rest just go by
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.080]   Because they were putting so much effort into these questions
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.920]   I couldn't get to him and it made me feel bad
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.840]   I remember that vividly feeling bad and at some point realizing my audience is too big for this one-on-one interaction
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.920]   it's taking up all of my time a
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:57.600]   Well crafted article can get to thousands a well-crafted email helps one person and at some point
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.080]   I don't know the exact year but somewhere in this
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.040]   Graduate student period I had to change
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.440]   and I had to change my contact page get rid of the general-use email address and
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:13.400]   No longer be accessible for just over the transom questions and it was traumatic. I thought that was difficult
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.960]   I remember having a hard having a hard time with that
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.000]   Maybe did a series around that point called college chronicles where I helped four or five
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Individual students and I popped and I wrote about it on the blog just that I was so used to helping
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Individuals and I wanted to still do it. So I figured if I helped people publicly
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.520]   Maybe their lessons would help other people and it was an interesting time. There's a difficult time
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.760]   So the decision to go Neil Stevenson and become a bad correspondent, it's not easy
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.440]   public facing figures often
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.920]   Have a hard time like I did with it
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.400]   It really is necessary though once your audience and reach grows past a certain place
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.080]   All right. So if you're in that situation
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.360]   The only thing I would recommend is just be very clear about your expectations if readers know I
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.160]   Can't just reach and get a question answered. But here's a here's a address where I can
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:07.440]   Send you something interesting that you'll probably see but you probably won't respond if I have a media request. Here's the person I talked to
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:16.320]   Clarity Trump's accessibility 95% of the time people get upset when they expect some sort of interaction that they don't end up
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.360]   Getting all right. Now, what about?
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.720]   individual limits on communication
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.040]   Not being accessible all the time by text
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:29.000]   Not being good about answering emails right away for your work colleagues
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.720]   This is a another
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:39.260]   Area in which Sam could be referring to when he talks about being myopic and selfish by making people communicate on your terms
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:44.100]   All right, when it comes to the individual level scales be it for your work colleagues or family
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:51.920]   Honestly my advice here and I articulate this more clearly in a world without email a book world without email
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.680]   Shut up about it
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.320]   Do it
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.180]   Think through communication. Don't just be accessible all the time
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.840]   Don't constantly be on text on email have other protocols have other other approaches to how you manage this communication
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   But don't tell everyone about it
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.960]   Don't tell everyone about it. This is the the Tim Ferriss autoresponder issue
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:18.200]   Tim had this great idea in 2007. Don't check email all the time novel at the time
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.760]   But then he added this very engineering type addition, which logically made all the sense in the world
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:29.360]   You should have an autoresponder that announces this intention to whoever writes you you write someone
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.720]   Like Tim at the time you get an autoresponder and it said something like his suggested autoresponder to serve you better
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:41.200]   I'm only checking email at twice a day at 11 and 3 if you need me in between there call my number
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.160]   To an engineer's mind that makes complete sense
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:50.320]   So why not explain to people so they know oh, I won't hear back from Tim till 3
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:57.920]   The audience at South by Southwest 2007 who heard him give that example thought it made complete sense. They're a bunch of engineers
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.600]   Here's the problem in the real world when you get that autoresponder you say that guy is
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.640]   Annoying and you can't even really put your finger on it, but it's violating some sort of dyadic
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.140]   tribal paleolithic evolved communication standard
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.520]   But it just annoyed people and it turned out it's better just check your email twice a day
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.400]   You don't have to make a thing about it
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.400]   Yet tell someone what you're doing
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.200]   You're giving a location for friction to be generated
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.800]   Well, why are you doing that twice a day? I don't know about twice a day. What if I need that's not good
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.700]   That's not gonna fly. What if I need you at noon? I don't like this at all
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.660]   Don't announce what you're doing at the individual scale. It just gives the sites for friction to generate just do it
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.700]   Apologize if you need to same thing with your family and text messaging
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.440]   I don't think you should be responding to text messages all day
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:48.120]   You have to have set times you do that. You need to accompany that with office hours. Don't call them office hours
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:53.260]   You're you're your family will think you're a weirdo or a fink but you know say hey, by the way
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.120]   I'm always available at 5 to 6 when I'm commuting home
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.960]   So like just you can always call me then I'll see what's going on or I always have my phone open on
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.720]   You know lunch at 12, whatever like they have set times
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.640]   They know or when I'm coming back, I drop the kids off at the bus stop. So that's very consistent and
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.780]   So from 8 to 8 20, I'm walking back. Just call me then
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.960]   So you have these implicit office hours and in our explicit
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.800]   Office hours and implicit times you check and then just do that and like people might complain some I couldn't hear from you
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.140]   But you're like, I'm sorry. I just saw this now. What are they gonna say?
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.700]   Unacceptable, you should have saw this earlier. They don't care. They saw. Okay, great. Here's my question
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:36.480]   So on the individual scale you do not announce what you're up to you just do it and apologize if you have to
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.720]   You know this happened with my a contractor is working with recently
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.880]   The emails were coming, you know
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.560]   I don't I check emails once a day at most in summer and so that we kept getting in situations where
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.880]   Maybe she would send an email at 4 p.m
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.440]   And I'd already checked email for that day
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.080]   Maybe at 3 and then the next day at 11 a.m. She sent another email. Hey, did you get this?
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.200]   What's going on? And I hadn't checked email yet that day because I write in the morning and you know what?
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.740]   I finally just apologized. I sent a letter like, you know, my summer schedule as a professor is I'm usually checking things once a day
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:14.860]   So don't expect more than it could be 24 hours right just depending on when I do the check
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.800]   It doesn't mean I don't see it. This is how I do it. But if it's more urgent
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:23.320]   Like a time sensitive thing you can text me and if there's something that really needs a lot of back-and-forth
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.440]   Because I'm not on email all day. Let's not do back-and-forth on email
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.400]   We can set up if we need a couple standing sort of office hour times
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.520]   You can always call me if we think there's gonna be a lot of work
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.080]   It needs four or five back and forth because that you can't spread out four or five back and forth over four or five days
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   Do you like yeah, great
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.040]   And the problem solved right? I didn't have to make a big lecture about it up front
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.540]   But when it became an issue, I gave a little explanation. Everyone was happy
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.200]   All right, so that's all I would say if you're a public-facing media figure eventually
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.520]   You can't be very accessible be very clear about that people understand or if they don't understand
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.940]   There's others who do to replace them and it comes to your individual life
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:03.960]   Don't make a big deal about it. Just do what's best for you and apologize only if pushed into it
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:13.560]   All right doing well here, you know what I didn't do I didn't number my questions I know we have ten
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.880]   But I should have numbered them because now I don't know where we are. Oh, well, let's just roll on
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   Larry has the next one
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.040]   Larry says hi professor Newport. I loved your book
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.920]   So good. They can't ignore you
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:32.640]   But it seems to me that only a small minority of people can possess rare and valuable skills at any given time
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.780]   Does this mean only a minority of people can succeed in achieving the ideal laid out in your book?
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:43.360]   If not, what would a world where most people are so good. They can't be ignored look like
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.080]   Thank you very much for your time
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.920]   Good question Larry. It allows me to clarify something. Yes, the big idea in my 2012 book
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.760]   Be so good. They can't ignore you is
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.740]   That you should build what I called rare and valuable skills
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:06.040]   Use those as leverage then to take control over your career move it towards things that resonate and away from things that don't
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:12.920]   More more recently. I might talk about that as use that leverage to get closer to your ideal lifestyle
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.880]   Same idea. So Larry is saying well, who's how many people can really have rare and valuable skills?
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:24.460]   How many people are going to be a world-class writer or mathematician or something like this and this is an important clarification
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:30.920]   Your definition Larry what you're thinking of when you think of rare and valuable skills is too broad
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:36.560]   Too strict I should say when you're thinking rare and valuable skills. You're thinking at
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.600]   large scales of
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   Competition rather that you're the best
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.800]   That's way too strict and ambitious when I say rare and valuable skills. I mean you can do something for your employer
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.120]   that is valuable to your employer and
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.360]   They don't have a lot of other people who can do that for them right now
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.200]   So the scope for rare and valuable skills is your employment situation?
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:05.520]   So everyone can have rare and valuable skills that give them leverage. I mean, let's get concrete
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.400]   Let's say you went to college you have an entry-level job
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:17.720]   You're working at a communications nonprofit outside of Boston. You have your fancy degree, but you're starting at an entry-level job. You're basically
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:22.520]   They'll call you an associate but you're kind of like an assistant to someone who's higher up
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.920]   You're helping organize projects and trips that they work on something like this right a very standard sort of entry-level job
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.540]   What would rare and valuable skills mean right there?
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.760]   well, you are
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.440]   Reliable you accomplish the things you say you're going to accomplish you're organized
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.720]   You you learn and understand
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.160]   Whatever it is that the people you assist do
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.920]   So you can make their life easier
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:54.760]   Maybe they work with a particular in this and I'm thinking about an actual person actual job here
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.240]   This is actually a job. My wife had out of college. So I'm using this as an example
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.680]   But let's say they work with a particular tour provider
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:07.400]   They would take teachers on tours getting to learn how that tour operator works and the people over there. That's all valuable
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.040]   That's very valuable to this employer and they don't have other people who can do this for him
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.040]   They could try to hire someone else, but they don't know if they're gonna be good or not that gives you leverage now
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.200]   You're able to move up you have leverage over what you want to do and what you don't want to do and you can start
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.160]   Moving up in that job you move up to the next level you do that next level. Well
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:28.200]   You get good at it. You master elements of it. They're specific to the job
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.220]   Other people don't do it as well as you and you move up
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.800]   So what I'm trying to say Larry is rare and valuable is relative to the employer
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.360]   Or if you're self-employed relevant to your specific clients
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:43.320]   Everyone can build rare and valuable skills in their particular context that career capital is leverage
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:50.260]   Use that leverage just keep moving your job closer and closer to supporting the lifestyle that you desire
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:55.280]   All right, what do we got here Matt
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.400]   Matt says you've argued
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.040]   about not basing
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.560]   your career decisions on passions
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:13.320]   But what about one's temperament specifically under the big five personality model if one is low in conscientiousness or particularly high in openness
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.680]   How should that be considered to avoid getting into an ill-suited role?
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.160]   All right
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.680]   So I put this back-to-back with Larry's question because they're both dealing with careers
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.940]   And they're both dealing with ideas for my book so good. They can't ignore you
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.920]   Now I think what's happening here again is
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:38.080]   Too strict of an interpretation of what I am talking about. So in so good. They can't ignore you. I
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:44.240]   reject what I called up the passion hypothesis, which is this idea that the primary factor in
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:51.660]   Generate a feeling of fulfillment or passion in your career is matching the type of work you do to the pre-existing passion
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:57.740]   If you can match your work successfully to what you're meant to do you will find your work fulfilling
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.140]   And if you get this match wrong, you won't
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.100]   That was a dominant hypothesis
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:08.180]   When I was writing so good, they can't ignore you. It is a dominant hypothesis today, though
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:13.100]   I would say not as strong now as it was back then. It's often summarized with the
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.140]   axiom follow your passion
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.740]   They argued that's wrong
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:24.580]   Now Matt, I think you're taking that argument and you're pushing it farther to say, okay, nothing nothing really matters
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.140]   Nothing intrinsic at all matters for whether or not you're gonna like your job and that's actually not true
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:35.980]   I'm pushing back against a strong form of the matching hypothesis that a match to a pre-existing passion is all that matters
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:42.020]   And I'm saying no. No, it's more complicated than that. The choice of job is not trivial
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:47.420]   But it is not the single determinant factor of whether or not you end up passionate about your work
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.860]   The real important stuff happens after you choose your job
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.980]   Do you build rare and valuable skills like we talked about with the last?
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.820]   question
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:01.300]   Are you applying those rare and valuable skills as leverage to move your career towards things that resonate and away from things that don't?
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:08.940]   Towards your ideal lifestyle and away from traps that you want to avoid. Are you crafting your career in a way that is?
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.900]   Consistent and complements your vision of a deep life if you're doing this that's very hard work
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.900]   It takes time and strategy over many years
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:22.580]   That is where real passion grows the actual initial choice of the job is just the first small step in that long journey
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.020]   That's really what I'm arguing
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:31.580]   However making that first small step choosing what job you want to do. That's not throwing a dart at
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:37.200]   A job listing board and say it doesn't matter at all. What job I have you still want to think about it
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.860]   So your temperament? Yes, it matters pick a job that's better suited for your temperament
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.780]   Do you like to be around people do you like to be alone? Sure
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.700]   You see your personality matters skills
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.460]   You already have matters if you're coming out of school with a math degree and you're pretty good at it
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:57.940]   Well, that's going to get you some career capital much faster than if you become a yoga instructor
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:02.100]   So pre-existing skills matter a general interest in the field. Sure that matters
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:07.700]   You know like I'm interested in academia seems romantic to me
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:13.740]   So, you know that is a mark in favor of going to graduate school all that stuff matters
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:21.420]   So use what you have when making your choice, but keep in mind that there may be many different jobs that make sense for you to pursue
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.900]   and
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.380]   Once you make the choices what happens next is ultimately decide whether or not you get
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.860]   Fulfilling out of it. So Matt you can take your temperament into account take your skills into account interest into account
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.860]   I'm a big believer in
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:38.460]   Looking at what would the opportunities be if and when I get really good at this job?
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:43.180]   and do I see down the line opportunities that are really going to give me a lot of
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:49.180]   Control over my life or open up the things that are really important to my ideal lifestyle. That's all critical
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:54.260]   Don't just throw a dart but don't think that the choice by itself is all that it takes to love your work and
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:33:00.180]   Don't over sweat that choice. There's usually many right answers. The issue is not I'm going to choose the wrong job
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.180]   The real issue for most people is I'm going to do the wrong things
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.780]   Once I have a job
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:12.980]   All right, I think we've had a bunch of men in a row so I have some women here
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:18.320]   There's three in a row. I did this by accident, but actually we had a run of men
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.020]   They'll have a run of
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.220]   Women asking questions. So let's actually get to some reasonable questions then
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:27.740]   All right, Sarah says how can schools implement a deep work approach?
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.420]   to learning
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.540]   All right. So let's think elementary
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:39.500]   High school level so like secondary elementary school level at that at that level of education
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:47.220]   Can we be doing things to prepare students for cognitive work and in particular deep work type efforts
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:53.700]   I think so. I think there's at least three things that we could specifically integrate into
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.140]   curriculums
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:03.180]   One is just the mental model teaching the students the mental model that talks about concentration as a skill. That is a
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.460]   trainable
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.260]   It's like running
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.260]   The more you train the faster you can do it and be
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.980]   incredibly valuable
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:18.220]   This is what allows okay great Andrew Wiles is all formats less theorem sure
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.900]   But it's also what allows your your favorite musician or songwriter?
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:28.340]   To do something really innovative with the music or to learn the instrument that they then play it away
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.700]   That is so impressive what allows this athlete to be so great
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.260]   that allows this writer to write this book that you love or
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:41.700]   That allows this public thinker to really shape the public conversation. You've got to teach them this mental model
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.180]   concentration especially in today's
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:51.820]   knowledge style economy knowledge style economy of ideas as well as actual economic output
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.300]   Concentration deep thinking careful thinking it's everything
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:01.340]   It's like being good with the sword in ancient Sparta, and it's something that has to be trained
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.020]   Just giving them that model very important
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.380]   to
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.260]   Practice this in the classroom
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.820]   And we're gonna sit here and do this. It's gonna be 20 minutes and
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:18.860]   Then you know what by October we're gonna do 30 minute sessions and by November. We're gonna do 40 minute sessions
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.660]   Just working on whatever these hard visualization problems or math problems are gonna do writing prompts
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.460]   You just write write write and don't let your concentration wander
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:31.180]   But then when it's over everyone can jump up and and you know run around and and get all their wiggles out and then we're gonna
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:37.260]   Sit down and do it again. You can actually practice concentration do interval training on concentration in the classroom
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.380]   A this will make them better at concentrating B. It reinforces that aspect of the mental model
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:46.900]   I reference that concentration can be trained let your students see they get better at it
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.980]   Let them see they get better at it
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:55.180]   That's more critical than how good you make them knowing that they can always get better at it
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:59.420]   And the three I would have detailed notes for parents
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:06.540]   About how homework should go and about this mental model and how homework is is an aspect for them to practice
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:13.820]   Sustained and focus concentration at home and how they should set up homework and it should be these set times
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.820]   They know when it's going to be and it should be
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:20.400]   Disconnected and there should be no phone there and you should say your students will 100% I will put
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:26.020]   $1,000 on the table wagering that the first thing your student will say to you is I need the computer
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.820]   I need internet to do research and there's Google Classroom has my notes in it
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.340]   Call BS on that great
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:36.620]   Let's sit down at the computer together and get everything you need and then you can go do the work with it
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.860]   Don't let them use that or here's the other one
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:41.900]   You will see you know, and I'll bet a lot of money on this because I've been doing this for a while. I
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.460]   Need my phone
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:49.420]   Because I have to I have to text my group mates if I have questions
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:53.340]   So you get detailed notes from teachers to say call BS
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:59.060]   You know homework should be a time for them to practice it by the way
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.700]   There is an extra mental health benefit to making work at home
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.660]   Especially for high school age students or junior high age students with pretty intense homework
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:16.740]   If you actually work structured without distraction the amount of time it takes to get that work done. Well cuts by a factor of two or three
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.260]   That's not nothing
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:24.180]   If three hours that goes kind of late into the night gets replaced with one hour done right before dinner
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:29.140]   It is a much smaller footprint that homework is a much smaller footprint on the student schedule
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.140]   So yes, I think we should be training deep work
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.540]   There are some ideas off the top of my head
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:39.980]   All right quick question Christine asks, when do you listen to podcast?
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:47.220]   For me chores is a big one cleaning dishes cleaning the house mowing the yard
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:52.980]   Great time to listen to either podcast or books on tape. I go back and forth. I treat those interchangeably
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.380]   driving
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:00.100]   So driving will be another time. I'll do that the walk home from my kids bus stop
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.180]   So I take my older two boys to the bus stop in the morning about 15 minutes away
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:09.460]   So that walk home I would consistently listen to things and then sometimes I would add on to that walk
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.860]   So I'd make it a little bit longer than 15 minutes on the way home
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:17.100]   So that's when I'm listening the podcast not all the time
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:23.540]   But during times when my mind would otherwise be bored the exception of that of course is listening to deep questions
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:29.420]   That you want to listen to as soon as it comes out as many times as you can fit into your week
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:33.580]   All right, let's do a
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.180]   Who here's another podcasting question, okay
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:41.540]   Got a podcasting question here pontificate a little bit. So caveat emptor
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:45.180]   Before we do a couple more sponsors. Okay, this question comes from Paula
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:50.060]   Paula says I really enjoy your episodes on
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:56.060]   The business of podcasting and its trends when I was looking for information on starting my own podcast
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:00.540]   It seemed like a lot of the materials out there were focused on podcast as marketing tools
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:07.420]   Ways to do quick easy production with lots of episodes as a content-rich way to show off your expertise
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:15.100]   I'm more interested in podcasting as the audio equivalent of long-form nonfiction narrative writing like a planet money or Freakonomics
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:20.020]   Paula notes in parentheses that she is a economist herself
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.440]   So that's why she was using Freakonomics as an example
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.300]   Paula goes on to say I see the value in all these formats
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.140]   But if the low barrier to start promotional style podcast fill the directories
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.500]   Does that turn off the potential audience to other styles?
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:38.180]   Do they step into the podcast world get overwhelmed see a lot of styles?
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.620]   They don't like and that feel very amateur and leave
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:49.060]   For amateurs interested in other styles does their entryway become working with an established production company like in traditional publishing thoughts. All right, Paula
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:53.140]   I love pontificating on podcasting as a
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.220]   Business, I have a few thoughts here number one
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:02.940]   No, I don't think the proliferation of these sort of low quality
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.660]   checklist productivity style
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:12.140]   Marketing podcast is going to hurt other more serious attempts at podcasting by checklist productivity. By the way, that's my
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:16.660]   That's my reference to the genre of productivity that says
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.380]   If you just have the right
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.780]   insider information
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.220]   the right steps and
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:29.420]   Just go through and execute these steps. You can accomplish these big really interesting things like you want to just work
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.060]   You want to triple your income and work a fraction of your time?
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:37.980]   Just have the right checklist to go through and at the other end of that you'll accomplish that goal. You want a podcast?
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:44.420]   It's going to be a great marketing tool for your company. The key is going through these checklists. That's checklist productivity for anything. That is
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:51.540]   Desirable for any type of outcome that a lot of people would want checklist or never enough. They're really appealing
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.380]   Because it's tractable. I put in a little bit of effort. I make my way through the list
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.780]   You feel like you're making progress but things that are hard or hard and checklist aren't enough
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:06.540]   Anyways, there's a lot of checklist productivity out there for marketing podcasts. You get a bunch of these podcasts that no one ever listens to
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.900]   Because it's people just
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.020]   Talking about whatever their industry is in a way that no one would care about
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.140]   I don't think that hurts other people making a more serious run
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:24.220]   Podcasting is developed enough. There's enough podcast out there. People aren't just perusing directories to see what they want to listen to
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.940]   It's more like radio shows or TV shows on streamers
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:33.900]   Now people hear about things through trusted sources a friend recommends it. They hear someone on another show a
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:38.460]   Show is spotlighted on one of these top charts or spotlights
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.380]   That let's say like an Apple or Spotify does that's how people find podcasts now
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.900]   So the fact that a lot of crap is out there. I don't think it's a problem. All right number two
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:49.580]   You ask
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:54.660]   Should you work with a production company? That's not really going to be that's not an entryway
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.540]   So there's not
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:01.500]   There's not production companies out there that will say, you know
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:07.660]   Paula like you seem like you're smart and interesting will build this podcast around you and like you'll find a big audience
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:13.620]   there are production companies, but who they tend to work with is either established podcast or
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.060]   established figures
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:20.580]   So like an established well-known writer and they will say you have a big audience
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:26.500]   We will will help you build the podcast around it. But often what they're really offering there is technical expertise
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.660]   So there's not
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:32.820]   There's not an entryway in the podcasting like you would have in publishing where if you have the right idea the right publisher
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.020]   Might get behind it and you can just focus on the writing and it could take off
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:43.020]   Podcasting requires a lot more from the you know, the actual podcaster has to build a show that builds an audience
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.900]   All right, so that's my second
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.020]   Third I
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:57.100]   Don't quite know how to develop this theory, but see I see a direct line I think blogging and podcasting are connected
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:04.060]   Social media which emerged between blogging and podcasting is a very different beast and it warped
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:11.040]   It's my pontification everyone should be aware. It warped our understanding of democratized digital content production. Here's what I mean about that
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.180]   when blogging came along and blogging as at the as the
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:22.940]   the rearguard action of the web in general web 2.0 the ability for the average person to be able to publish text that's accessible around
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:28.380]   The world without having to have access to a magazine or to a newspaper or to a book press this revolution
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:34.180]   This democratizing of text in the digital in the digital setting that sort of reached its apotheosis with the blog
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.780]   This was an important revolution
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:45.340]   But most blogs did terribly because it turns out here's what happens when you use digital tools to democratize
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.980]   different media channels it allows
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.700]   many more people
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:56.980]   to get in and take a swing, but what it doesn't do is lower the bar of
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.940]   quality of originality for success
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.420]   So it's a good thing for
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:11.020]   the culture writ large because there's lots of diverse voices or interesting voices or or styles or ideas that
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:15.740]   That never really would have got a shot to get above that bar if they had to write for life
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:20.220]   Magazine and try to get in there blogging minute was possible that you you could take your shot
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.720]   No one's going to hold you back
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:27.320]   So it's good for the culture writ large because you get a more interesting more innovation more interesting set of writers
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.760]   but for the individual it can seem frustrating because
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:37.140]   99.9% of individuals aren't producing stuff at the bar that it matters. So when you this is the key mistake of the
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.500]   democratization of digital media that people often make
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.340]   democratizing access to the media does not
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:47.260]   Reduce the quality bar relate required to succeed
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:52.180]   So we get this standard pushback around blogging when that happens like well, most blogs are bad
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:56.020]   So this isn't changing publishing but it did yes, of course most blogs are bad
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:01.420]   But there was a lot of good ones and it brought a lot of people to the into the industry that might have otherwise
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:07.660]   Not and innovated the form and you know, you have the whole like just even in politics even the whole
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:15.380]   Wonk approach to understanding politics and wonk blog and yet as our client and Nate Silver and all this came out of blogging these voices
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:21.820]   That you know would have otherwise had to have worked their way up through newsrooms and the traditional political reporting
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.620]   Podcasting is very similar. It's democratizing digital audio
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:33.780]   Now almost anyone like me can put together a show and have it out there and it can leap across the uncanny valley
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.460]   between the internet and terrestrial radio that we're used to and and you can
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:42.460]   Be in the same ecosystem and almost anyone can do this now and this is all great for the whole culture because you have a lot
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.340]   Of innovation happening
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:49.400]   but for the individual is still hard because the quality bar is still really high to produce an audio program that a lot of people want
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.140]   To listen to is really hard. It's like why most radio shows failed
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:57.580]   It's why the people who were great at it the Howard Stearns of the world the Dave Ramsey of the world make a lot of
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.580]   Money, it's really hard to do
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:05.180]   Now why I talked about social media being a divergence is because social media warped our
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:10.660]   understanding of this democratization of digital media because it didn't just democratize
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:17.420]   Access to various media they played these weird algorithmic games with attention
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:20.060]   and I talked about this some in
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.060]   Deep work a little bit in digital minimalism as well
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.940]   But I had more of a for lack of a better word
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:32.740]   Collectivist model of attention where it not just gave everyone access to publish we had that before
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:38.580]   But it gave everyone access to some attention now. It used to be in the early days of
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:43.240]   Social media back when it was really based on the social graph the way this unfolded was
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:48.720]   You would post things and your friends would look at what you posted and they would give you comments on it and you would do
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:53.060]   The same for them and now you can kind of post stuff and have and you could have
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:58.140]   Attention. Yeah. Hey, look, here's a picture. I went to the farm or here's what I was up to today
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:02.140]   Here's a little quip and people give you attention. Hey, good work. That looks beautiful or whatever
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.220]   And if you had tried to post any of that on a blog
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:08.500]   Like no one would have come there wasn't a collectivization of attention there
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.500]   That wasn't gonna attract an audience
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.460]   I've God forbid you had a newspaper column where you were just posting these observations
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.900]   You know the paper would have fired you on day two, but social media added this new artificial
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:22.740]   Attention redistribution, which is really what people want is the attention
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.380]   So it used to just be this
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:31.540]   Implicit contract between friends. I'll post stuff. Let's be honest garbage. You'll post kind of garbage
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.980]   We'll all talk about each other's garbage and we'll all feel like we have an audience
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.060]   then things got more sophisticated and
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.820]   By the time you get to something like tick-tock
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:46.500]   Now you have just direct manipulation of attention redistribution where they will take something you post
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:50.960]   Occasionally and show it to a lot of people so that from your perspective you were getting these
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:57.640]   Intermittent hard to predict giant burst of reinforcement that make you feel like my god like that really took off
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.700]   Maybe I'm really close to breaking out
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:05.460]   When I was a writing at Bevco yesterday at the coffee shop near where I?
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:10.180]   Record this podcast. There was a two gen Z years on I might have been a date
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:15.460]   I don't know sound like a date like a first date and they were just going back and forth about tick-tock and like well
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:21.140]   I had this one video and you know, it had these views and that's just pure manipulation of attention
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:25.940]   So now it used to be an implicit contract between friends on sharing a network and now just the algorithms do it itself
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:32.180]   I think that warped people's understanding of success and media and made it feel like more just your personal
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.380]   expression and observations of the world are
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.680]   Always just you know one
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:44.020]   Mr. Beast breakthrough away from you suddenly having a big audience that everyone has the potential
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:49.140]   Potentially having a big audience and you get just enough reinforcement you this trickle of online reinforcement that you're used to it
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.140]   and then you go back to the
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:59.840]   Non-manipulated pitiless media world of podcasting just like blogs were before it and just like traditional media was before that and it's crickets
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:03.860]   So Paul I've wandered way off your original question
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:08.940]   I just think this is interesting that that we have these two points going on here if we're gonna just pontificate again about
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:11.940]   media
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.980]   democratization of digital media
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.980]   democratized access to publishing your voice
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.620]   It did not lower the bar of quality required to succeed with an audience
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.300]   but social media
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.140]   collectivized or redistributed attention in a
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:31.580]   manipulative manner to keep people using it and retrain people to expect and think
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.820]   You know if you're just out there and you're interesting you never know
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:39.460]   So that all goes to say Paul back to your plan to start a podcast
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:44.420]   It's just hard. You know, it's just a very competitive pitiless landscape
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.060]   You have to have something that's going to have a large audience say this
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.220]   I have to listen to is it is a hard world out there. This show does pretty well
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:55.700]   It's not a super successful show. It does pretty well and is really hard work to get there
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:01.540]   We put a lot of effort into this and look I have a large audience. I've been writing books for a long time
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.540]   I'm published all around the world
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:04.820]   I
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:11.340]   I've been around I've been known I've been thinking and talking professionally about these things for well over a decade and we work really hard
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.660]   Jesse and I to try to make this show tighter and tighter. We have a good audience
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:20.380]   But it's not massive. I'm just saying it's hard work. It's hard work. You got to think about it like a
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:22.500]   large FM
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.500]   radio station or cable news
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:28.740]   Channel hired you to put together a show and how hard you would have to work to try to make that show a success
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:34.420]   That's the way to think about it. Don't let the artificial redistribution of attention that's been leveraged by social media
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:38.460]   Warp your understanding of what actually goes into success here
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:43.500]   All right, well speaking about succeeding with a podcast
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:46.620]   Let me talk about a sponsor
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.260]   See Paula, that's the type of professional transition. You will have to learn to do
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:55.380]   If you want to get an audience and make some money off of it
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.060]   So I want to talk about one of our new sponsors is Z biotics
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:07.100]   So I like to say there are a few sponsors that I was more eager for to go rigorously test their product
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:11.260]   This is definitely a product. I gave many rigorous tests
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:17.140]   So what is Z biotics? It is a pre alcohol probiotic
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.900]   Indeed, it is the world's first
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:26.980]   Genetically engineered probiotic it was invented by scientists to tackle rough mornings after
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:28.940]   drinking
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.860]   So here's how it worked
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:37.540]   When you drink alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in your gut it is this byproduct
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:43.220]   Not as people often say dehydration does the blame for your rough next day?
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.380]   By the way, I believe that claim I remember back in college
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:52.060]   We tested it. I would drink two now genes of water
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:55.880]   that's 64 ounces of water after a
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:59.300]   You would say boisterous night
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:06.740]   Yes still have a rough day. The next day is not just dehydration. So as they found out the z-byte X team
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.740]   There's other byproducts produced by alcohol that can create those rough days
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.580]   Z-biotics has an enzyme that breaks down
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:15.620]   the specific byproduct that they have
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:19.660]   pinpointed as causing issues the day after a
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.420]   celebratory evening
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:23.060]   All right
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:28.500]   So it does stuff your liver would otherwise do but it takes care of this breaking down in your gut before it causes more issues
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.940]   So you drink z-biotics before drinking alcohol?
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:36.700]   You drink responsibly get a good night's sleep and you will feel your best the next day
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.340]   very clever idea
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:45.940]   Very clever idea. I just read Jurassic Park. We reread that with our kids. We had it. We listened to it on tape a
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.700]   road trip recently and I think this is a
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.620]   much better use of genetic engineering and
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:59.180]   Instead of putting all that know-how know-how about genetic engineering to bring back dinosaurs from extinction
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:03.420]   leading to many gruesome deaths instead and we can
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:09.220]   Thank the heavens for this we put that attention instead into something much cooler and much safer
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.980]   Which is helping to prevent rough days after alcohol consumption
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:17.500]   So give z-biotics a try for yourself go to zbiotics.com

[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:51.940]   I always say ideas are power in our current moment and the best source of quality ideas are
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:57.260]   Books, the problem is figuring out which books to read
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:03.780]   Which books you just need to know the big ideas from this is where Blinkist enters the picture. It's a subscription service
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:08.260]   That gives you 15 minute text or audio
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.900]   summaries
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.900]   called blinks of
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:18.500]   Thousands of best-selling non-fiction books. In fact, they have condensed over 5,000 titles in 27
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:20.660]   categories
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:24.180]   They even now have a new product called short cast which are blinks for
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.200]   podcast
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   So the way I recommend
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:34.620]   Using Blinkist is if there's a topic that you're interested in find a bunch of relevant books
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:40.780]   listen to the blinks learn to main ideas learn the landscape of that of that general area of
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:42.980]   knowledge
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:48.420]   Now you have a foundation to think and talk about intelligently and you figured out which of these books if any are worth actually diving
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:53.020]   Into a more detail and you can buy and read just the books that are really going to matter
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.800]   This is not just for business this can be for growth
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:03.300]   Personal growth self-help. There's a large number of categories over 27 categories covered by Blinkist

[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.340]   So for example, maybe you read
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:17.780]   Stapiens by Yuval Harari and you said is his follow-up homo deus worth reading? What's it about? Boom? 50-minute blink?

[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:59.620]   Pure professionalism. Let's do three more quick questions. I want to get the ten. We're going to do ten
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:05.780]   Even if I lose my voice trying. All right, so this would be question number eight
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.220]   Do a little mental math here question number eight comes from Matt
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:16.700]   Matt says it seems to me that a lot of your views that are your most famous for are contrarian
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.420]   This seems to have served you pretty well
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:24.940]   Do you often reflexively adopt these contrarian views if so, does it ever end up backfiring?
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:30.580]   And if you are selective and adopting certain country and blues views what factors you weigh when deciding to go against a grain?
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.500]   Well two points Matt
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.860]   one
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.860]   Not all of my views are contrarian
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:42.300]   You know, I would say there's really three large categories the type of stuff I write about
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.740]   So I do have some well-known
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:50.280]   Contrarian views in particular my pushback against the idea that you should follow your passion and my pushback against using social media
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:56.380]   Those at least in the moments in which I articulated those were quite contrarian not so much anymore a
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:02.140]   Lot of my other popular ideas. However, I would put in a different category. I would say it is
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:07.020]   Structuring and articulating clearly things people already believe they just need someone to
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.500]   to help them
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.500]   Organize their pre-existing
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:15.620]   Feeling so with contrarian ideas. You're often trying to convince someone
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.580]   To change their mind about something
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:24.340]   You think following your passion is the right thing to do. I want to convince you of something different. Here is a secret
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:31.060]   It's hard to have a really successful nonfiction book convincing people to change their mind. What's much more effective is
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:38.980]   Giving structure and voice to something they already believe so a lot of my popular ideas fall under that category
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.460]   Deep work is an example
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:46.860]   It's not contrarian that book didn't do well because people picked it up and said no way
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:52.460]   You mean deep work? I want more email. What are you talking about? And then they read it and they were convinced
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.340]   No, that's not how that book was successful people were overwhelmed
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:58:01.420]   They knew something was wrong with the way work was unfolding and this gave voice to it. That's why that book was successful
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.980]   Slow productivity is like that
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:07.220]   People feel this discomfort with burnout
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:13.660]   They feel the ambiguity and lack of specification around our notions of what we even mean to be productive and when they hear slow
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:17.700]   Productivity just that term when they hear the three principles do fewer things
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.500]   working at a natural pace
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:24.860]   Obsessing over quality it sounds right from moment one
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:29.580]   Structure articulating things people already believe same with a lot of my work on the deep life
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:33.020]   I'm convincing people the deep life is
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:40.260]   Worthwhile, they know that trying to give some structure to that already existing impulse and then the final category of stuff I write about
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:45.820]   It's like a lot of my New Yorker writing. It's more just observing and explaining trends. It's an expository
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.980]   So I would say most my stuff actually is not contrarian
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:55.100]   I do like contrary an idea so Matt and I think it comes from my appreciation of the Socratic dialectic a
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:59.980]   Lot of people think this you think that two opposing views collide
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:05.180]   truth a burges big believer on hitting one view against another
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:11.260]   Taking something you believe in and getting the best articulation to get someone to believe something different in that collision of opposition
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:17.420]   The roots of deeper understanding are grown. So when I do go towards the contrary and it's probably
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:20.380]   motivated by the dialectic
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:27.540]   Danielle says how can I stop my digital minimalism principles from going out the window after?
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:30.780]   having a baby
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:33.540]   So she talks about I'm gonna condense this some
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:38.860]   She's on her phone a lot more because she's taking pictures to send to her family and there's also useful
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:43.300]   Things for her baby that she uses on the phone like controlling the lights or the white noise in the room
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.180]   And reading she really emphasizes
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:49.520]   Reading when you're doing those feedings in the middle of the night
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:55.780]   You have your phone and she ends up I'm quoting here quoting her here doom scrolling the Guardian online at 5 a.m
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:57.780]   The check the latest kovat news
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.500]   etc
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.180]   Alright, she says the bad phone habits have now set back in like rot
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:07.780]   My phone seems like the most efficient way to stay occupied during this long feeds. I
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.380]   Don't want to give myself too much of a hard time
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.380]   But I don't want my son pretty much ever to see me on my phone once he's old enough
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.020]   Be able to recognize it. You know, what do I do?
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:21.460]   Well, Danielle first you're right to go easy on yourself when you're in the infant stage. I mean anything goes
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.740]   survival
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.860]   not a time to be really on yourself about
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:33.780]   Your phone habits on exercise and food on are you properly socializing with people?
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.820]   It's a little bit of an all-hands-on-deck at least until you sleep train
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:42.260]   And I do hope you sleep train Danielle because you got to balance the needs of the baby with your own
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:49.220]   One concrete thing I'll just offer from our own experience is when we had our first my wife had the same issue
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:54.700]   With the phone reading during the late night feeds. So she bought a Kindle paperwhite
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.500]   That's when the pin Kindle paper whites first came into our lives
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:03.140]   So you could read a book during the feeds and the paperwhite has its own built-in backlight
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.980]   That is not disturbing
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:12.740]   It doesn't fill the room with light. It's not gonna bother the baby. It doesn't change you into oh my god is daytime and
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.500]   so that the Kindle paperwhite is
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.100]   not a bad idea for
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:25.340]   Distraction during late-night feedings that is not going to send you down a doom scrolling rabbit hole
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.860]   The other thing she innovated
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:34.060]   In our household was also like the the go basket next to every place you might feed
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:39.060]   It had all sorts of various things like snacks water bottles. I'd read I get you know
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.700]   Fresh ice water and good insulated things before the night
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.500]   towels, you know for the mess
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:44.660]   Yeah
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:49.460]   These go baskets next to all the places you would you would feed and see if your paper white all the stuff you need
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.700]   You just got to make that as easy as you can. I
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:55.540]   Like your idea by the way of not having your kids see you on the phone all the time
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:01.340]   It doesn't matter with an infant. It doesn't matter even with a one-year-old or two-year-old. I do think it matters
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:06.020]   We should talk about this more as a culture when you're talking about a five-year-old seven-year-old a 12 year old
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:11.100]   They see you on your phone all the time. You have a hard time convincing them. They shouldn't do the same
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:18.300]   All right, one last question family and friend related comes from event
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:23.620]   Who says how do you explain a shift to the deep life to friends and family?
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:30.940]   I am a law student from Norway and your books and ideas have really helped me in answering some big questions regarding my life and career
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:35.540]   My friends and family don't really seem to understand my shift in focus. I
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:38.380]   Live with my three best friends and they still
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:44.100]   Enjoy the reckless responsibility free lifestyle the early 20s renowned for I did too
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.500]   But now me and my friends ambitions don't align anymore
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.300]   They plan a lot of activities during the day, which is when I want to work. I
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:53.300]   Still hang out with them almost every evening
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:57.040]   But when I now say no to their daytime activities or want to go read a book in the evening
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.080]   They bugged me about working too much. I feel bad
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.740]   also, my father
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:08.180]   expects me to just kind of hang out in the living room when I am home for Christmas and gets annoyed when I want to
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.960]   Go for a walk on my own reflect or go to my room and create a small video for a couple of hours
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:17.000]   As you've explained the deep life is radical and demands that you are comfortable with missing out on other things
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   However, I'm finding it hard to steer my life in a different direction than my friends and family and to miss out on some of their
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.740]   experiences
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.000]   well, I think you're going through a a
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.460]   well-known developmental phrase right now and
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:38.100]   And I believe the Latin the Latin description of this developmental phase is you're growing the hell up
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:42.760]   That's all that's happening here with your friends you're growing up
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.620]   They're still in that student mode
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:49.860]   You are transitioning to more of an adult mode
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:57.700]   Where your identity is now largely separated from a group dynamic and is much more individuated
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:03.020]   You have autonomy over your time as well as responsibility now. It's kind of up to me to
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:08.820]   Take care of myself and make money and pay the bills or with responsibility, but you also have autonomy
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:14.920]   Socializing becomes more something that is compartmentalized. I want to spend time with you. Let's make a time to do this
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.960]   We're gonna work out together. We're gonna go to a movie together, but it becomes a much more
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.600]   Scheduled it less of this sort of background ongoing home that you would see in a group dynamic
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.520]   You're becoming an adult
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.800]   And this happens at different times for different people
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:36.580]   Just watch any Judd Apatow movie from 15 years ago and you will see for some people it comes kind of late other people
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.580]   They get there earlier
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.960]   You basically are the knocked up character
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.080]   After Katherine Heigl has the baby not before that's sort of what's happening here
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.760]   And I think it's good. Everyone goes through this. You're just starting to go through it. Now you got to
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.000]   focus on work
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.200]   Get a job with opportunities be so good. They can't ignore you build rare and valuable skills
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:04.240]   Build up a little bit more income have your own place some more responsibility gain some more sense of efficacy
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.680]   This is the standard stuff of growing up in your 20s
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.840]   Your relationship with your friends are going to change
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.120]   Some of those friends are going to go away as you find more adult friends
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.880]   Some of those friends will grow up and will remain your friends. This is all natural
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.960]   Your relationship with your family is going to change as you become more of an adult
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:24.680]   It's not a father-son relationship. It becomes more of a peer relationship and then you realize, you know
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.680]   If I'm home for a few days for Christmas
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.480]   You know, I'm here to be around him and socialize with my family. I
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.200]   can do
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.600]   my
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.600]   deep work structured
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.360]   Reflection on my own time and maybe I cut my trip a little bit shorter
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.120]   But what if I'm there maybe I want to be there for what does this guy need right now?
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:48.600]   Suddenly, it's a different relationship. You're interacting with peers. You're actually thinking what does this person need from me? It's more maturity
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.560]   Anyways, it's all great. I love being an adult. I was I was an adult early
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.960]   I was impatient
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.680]   I was about halfway through college where I was ready to be on my own and doing this type of thing
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.680]   So it's good what you're going through
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.920]   Live on your own start building your own way in the world
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.400]   Let the ideas of the deep life structure this pursuit from day one that will keep you on the right track
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:15.200]   But as you move farther down this track with structure to your forward momentum life is going to get deeper and more interesting
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:22.040]   So you're just starting event and it's going to get deeper and deeper and yeah, it's painful at first your friends aren't there
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.080]   They'll get there
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.200]   But you're going to hell up and I think that's a good thing
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:31.560]   All right, everyone ten questions in one hour and six minutes. I feel good about it
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:36.840]   One take Tony is what Jesse calls me and that's what we did here. Just went for it and got it done
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.840]   So thank you everyone who sent in their questions
