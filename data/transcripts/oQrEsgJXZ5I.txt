[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   Hello, APJ listeners. Thanks for spending so much time with Pastor John and me over the years. We're
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.080]   honored that you're along on this ride of what God has done and continues to do through this podcast.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.600]   It's bigger than us, and we know that. So thank you for being a part of it. And it's just me today
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.600]   with an update for you about a few new programming changes to be aware of.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.320]   And the first change coming up is an announcement, actually. It's an exciting one for us here at
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.880]   Desiring God because we're now offering a brand new John Piper sermon podcast. It launched in
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.400]   mid-April. Likely you already heard about it. It's called Light in Truth. Light in Truth. Be sure to
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.560]   subscribe to the new podcast feed to enjoy sermons from Pastor John's pulpit ministry.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.840]   Classic sermons, new sermons, five days a week, all curated in a new podcast hosted by Dan
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.080]   Kruver. He's doing a great job. It's going to be a great addition to your podcast feed.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.280]   And with the addition of the new podcast come two changes to Ask Pastor John, this podcast.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.920]   And the first is that we're going to bring sermon clip curation Wednesdays to an end. So Wednesdays
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.880]   we would play sermon clips. That was a lot of fun. And you all sent me tons of great clips over the
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.720]   years. Thank you for your emails. Thank you for sharing those clips with me and sharing your
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.440]   memories too. So many of us have stories about unforgettable moments or seasons of life when a
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.280]   sermon from Pastor John just met us in a moment of need. And you've been sharing that with us on
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.040]   the podcast with those clips. But sermon clip Wednesdays will end and it's going to end in May.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.280]   So instead of sermon clips, those of you who want to listen to curated John Piper sermons,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.040]   subscribe to the new Light in Truth podcast. You'll find it there. And that brings me to
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.200]   change number two. In removing the Wednesday slot, APJ is moving to two times per week.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.040]   Two times per week. We'll be publishing now two episodes per week on Mondays and on Thursdays.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.520]   For a number of years now, we've been publishing on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.440]   taking the Wednesday slot out. And now we're going to publish new APJs on Mondays and Thursdays. And
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.760]   that change will begin in June. I just wanted to give you a heads up on that. It's coming.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.400]   And I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for listening, for supporting us, and for sending
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.520]   us your incredible questions. Keep those coming, which you are. We have no shortage of questions
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.480]   ahead of us. In fact, already we have May and June and all of July and most of August already
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.400]   scheduled out with themes and emails. It's as busy as ever here for us. And Pastor John continues to
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.080]   love investing his time in APJ, which is great. In fact, we're just reviewing his schedule for
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.600]   the next year ahead and his ministry commitments. And he said to us, "APJ remains a deeply satisfying
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:01.920]   investment of effort, and it's probably the hardest thing I do." I know what he's talking
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.680]   about. It's not easy work answering your hard questions, but it's deeply satisfying work.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.760]   And I love working on this podcast alongside him. We have much work ahead of us in this second
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.000]   decade of the podcast now. So those are the updates. Subscribe to Light and Truth today,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.480]   and APJ moves to Mondays and Thursdays in June. I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.840]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast. See you soon.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.240]   you
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.120]   you
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.620]   you
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.580]   you
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.080]   you
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.120]   you
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.620]   you
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.420]   you
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:45.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
