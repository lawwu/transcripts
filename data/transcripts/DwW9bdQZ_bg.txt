[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420]   But that's essentially what it was.
[00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.420]   It's a bunch of really young girls who get into the industry.
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.340]   Like the younger, the better for them.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.740]   These girls, like when I started, I looked like a little kid.
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.540]   Like I looked like a little kid.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.460]   And that's what they, that's what they like.
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.460]   That's what sells.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.820]   It's not the other people's fault.
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.300]   Um, it's just a huge problem that there's not really anything to set up to protect
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.100]   girls that are young and vulnerable, that don't know how to say no or, or don't
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.980]   like have self-respect for themselves yet or care for themselves or love themselves
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.620]   because they've been through so much and like taught not to.
