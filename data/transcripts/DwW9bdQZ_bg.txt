[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420]   But that's essentially what it was.
[00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.440]   It's a bunch of really young girls who get into the industry.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.360]   Like the younger, the better for them.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.400]   These girls, like when I started, I looked like a little kid, like I
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.460]   looked like a little kid and that's what they, that's what they like.
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.480]   That's what sells.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.840]   It's not the other people's fault.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.300]   It's just a huge problem that there's not really anything to set up to protect
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.100]   girls that are young and vulnerable that don't know how to say no or, or don't
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.980]   like have self-respect for themselves yet or care for themselves or love themselves
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.620]   because they've been through so much and like taught not to.
