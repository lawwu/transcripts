[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   Well, happy 4th of July to everyone in the States.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.240]   There's no vacation for the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.240]   No way.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.520]   We have too much to talk about, but we do have our own fireworks because today we're
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.020]   in the middle of a conversation about universalism, the distorted theology that says that everyone
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.360]   will be saved in the end.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.720]   It has, this doctrine of universalism has a very long and vast history that stretches
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.960]   back decades and centuries and millennia.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.920]   And that story is now told in a massive two volume, 1400 page book titled The Devil's
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.320]   Redemption, A New History and Interpretation of Christian Universalism from Baker Academic.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.120]   The author of that book is our guest again, Michael J. McCliman, who joins us from St.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.120]   Louis.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.480]   Michael, it's good to have you back.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.440]   You know, on Monday we were talking about universalism and how the threat remains very
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.240]   relevant today.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.840]   And you mentioned that the doctrine of God is at stake in universalism.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.720]   And you even said after writing the book that it was a surprising thing for you to see how
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.720]   many other doctrines universalism distorts.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.160]   So pick it up here.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.600]   What are some implied theological entailments of Christian universalism and what are some
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.720]   of the ways that theology gets skewed in Christian universalism?
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.280]   Well, if we could start with just with the doctrine of God, to my surprise, I found that
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.200]   from ancient times onward, beginning with the Gnostics of the second and third century,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.800]   and then Jewish and Christian Kabbalah, and some of the so-called esoteric views and modern
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.360]   esoteric theories, is that there was a concept of God.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.920]   First of all, that God is not independent of the world.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.320]   God is dependent upon the world, or that God created the world in order to evolve in and
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.480]   through the world.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.640]   It's almost like God was a spirit in need of a body and the world became his body and
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.400]   that God is enriched.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.760]   And in the beginning, God is incomplete.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.880]   By creating the world, he completes himself.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.640]   It's almost like God and the world are married to one another.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.720]   And this is a view that sometimes, I mean, there are different terms for it.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.000]   This may sound like process theology to some.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.200]   Some use the term panentheism.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.640]   But actually, it's an ancient view that goes all the way back to the early centuries of
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.080]   the church.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.920]   But this is a view that is unworthy of God.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.400]   It is unworthy of God.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.200]   It is inconsistent with the fundamental biblical and creedal principle of creation from nothing.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   Creation from nothing implies that everything that exists other than God is radically dependent
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.920]   upon God's will.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.240]   So to use a mathematical equation, you could say the world minus God equals nothing.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.640]   If you took God away, the world would cease.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.580]   God minus the world equal God.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.960]   God is not diminished by the disappearance of the world.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.440]   But there's some modern theologians that disagree with that.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.640]   They think that if the world were taken away, God would be deficient and lacking.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.000]   So we need to recover, actually, a sense of the freedom and lordship of God.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.080]   And I think this has some deep connections culturally with a rejection of authority and
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   the idea.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.640]   I mean, there's some modern theologians who speak of human beings as co-creators of the
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.720]   world with God.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.360]   And if you look in all Scripture, the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, the word creation
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.220]   never has any grammatical subject to it other than God.
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.400]   God alone creates.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.580]   It's a prerogative of God.
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.920]   So it's a great mistake, exegetically speaking, to begin to think and speak of ourselves as
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.760]   creators alongside of God.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   >> Adam: Amen.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.560]   God is perfect bliss in himself in the absence of creatures.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560]   >> David: Right.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   >> Adam: Yeah.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.120]   And you know, I love to ask my kids this question.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.040]   Like, why did God make everything that he made?
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.240]   Because it's the kind of question that really diagnoses a lot of things and leads to some
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.040]   really great conversations with them.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.340]   So I'll pose the same question to you, because you take this up in the book, actually, as
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.680]   one of those theological things that gets mixed up and muddled in universalism.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.000]   It's a hard question to get right, but how do you answer it?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.760]   >> David: It is a difficult question to grapple with because there seems to be a paradox.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.960]   This is sometimes called the full bucket paradox.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.880]   If God's bucket of glory was absolutely full, then why would God need—God could not add
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.360]   anything to his own glory by creating the world.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.840]   And so it would seem that there's no purpose in creation.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.040]   And so one way to think of that visually is imagine that bucket full of water, but you
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.160]   put a hose in it and turn the hose on, and suddenly the bucket overflows.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.260]   So one way to understand this is the world is an overflow of the goodness, not a result
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.440]   of deficiency within God.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   Like God was lonely or God was lacking, but no, God was so full of goodness that that
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.120]   goodness overflowed.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.320]   And you get this sense in some of the classic theologians like Augustine, who says, "Because
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.040]   God is good, therefore you exist."
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.720]   And this is very much Edward's theology.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.400]   He even uses the image of a fountain overflowing.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.840]   Obviously, that could be misinterpreted.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.920]   He doesn't have an impersonal idea of God.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.080]   God is a personal creator, but he's struggling for language to kind of express the inexpressible
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.720]   because we are very much at the limits of what we can say or imagine when we begin talking
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.760]   about God's reason for creating.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.760]   >> Adam: Amen.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   Yeah, and yet without creation becoming an accident of some sort of divine mistake, but
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.080]   creation emerging with a plan and a goal for creation settled right from the beginning.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.080]   >> David: Right.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.920]   >> Adam: Yeah, so universalism distorts God and his purposes.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.760]   Give us specific examples of how universalism distorts grace.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.280]   >> David: Well, the great irony is that the effort to extend grace to all persons ends
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.000]   up undermining grace to any persons.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.880]   And that's not, it's counterintuitive.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.520]   That requires some explanation.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.360]   People could read the book for the fuller explanation.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.240]   Because you'd think, well, if one certain number of people receive salvation, a thousand
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.640]   receive salvation, and then 5,000 people being saved is five times better, and you'd think,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.120]   well, why wouldn't we just extend that in our mind indefinitely to everyone?
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.760]   But when you look at the reason, the rationale given by the different universalist thinkers
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.680]   for salvation, you end up in just about every case undermining the principle of grace.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.520]   There's the idea that I am saved because I am divine.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.480]   That's the hardcore Gnostic idea.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.240]   We have the divinity within us.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.720]   I use the analogy of the helium balloon in someone's chest.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.800]   The moment they die, that balloon sort of leaves, you know, and it escapes, it ascends
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   heavenward.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.480]   Well, if salvation happens that way because of a natural property that we all have as
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:00.120]   human beings, this divine element within us, then obviously there would be no need for
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   a Savior.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.040]   There'd be no need for grace.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.760]   There's another version of universalism, I'm saved because I'm human.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.280]   And I think that they're both esoteric thinkers.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:18.040]   I think there's even an element in Karl Barth's idea of like an eternally realized incarnation,
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.840]   that Jesus Christ is eternal.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.300]   This is a very abstruse point in the interpretation of Barth's church dogmatics.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.120]   But if God and humanity have always been joined together in some sense, well, then we would
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.880]   be saved just because you're human.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.880]   Again, why would there be a need for faith, repentance, obedience?
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.280]   And wouldn't God be almost obligated then to save everyone?
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.800]   Wouldn't salvation be entitlement?
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.840]   There's another version of universalism that I'm saved because I suffer.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.920]   That's the idea of a kind of purgatory after death where everyone expiates their own sins.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.160]   The Russian theologian, Sergei Bulgakov, said there is no free forgiveness.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.240]   This is like a direct quote.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.080]   Everyone expiates without remainder all of their own sins.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.480]   It's a shocking statement.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.680]   And he's considered an outstanding Russian theologian of the 20th century, but my gosh,
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.920]   what was the cross for?
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.800]   I mean, this teaching is directly in competition with the idea of an atoning death of Jesus
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   on the cross.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:26.080]   So the only other version of universalism that's left to try to preserve grace is just
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.240]   say that God just reverses everything, every choice we've made.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.640]   That everyone at the moment they die, even the mass murderer, as he's shooting down
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.360]   his victims and suddenly he's shot dead, he just goes immediately to be with God.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.800]   God just changes his character at the moment of death.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.680]   But that's sometimes called ultra-universalism because it holds that everyone goes immediately
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.860]   to be with God.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:53.000]   But that's a view that's so radical it undermines all the significance of our moral
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.840]   and spiritual choices in this life.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   It even seems to make the present life kind of a charade.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.400]   And many universalists, therefore, have been purgationists.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.840]   They believed in postmortem suffering because they just thought, "We can't believe that
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.660]   everyone is ready to be with God in heaven."
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.680]   So that's the dilemma that the universalists can't resolve.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.440]   Either you hold to ultra-universalism, which empties our moral choices of meaning, or else
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.120]   you suffer to make expiation or atonement for your own sins.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.960]   In that case, you undermine grace.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.360]   There isn't a good answer in terms of universalism.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.040]   Yeah, this distortion of grace is very significant.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.360]   And your book has guts.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.480]   And by that I mean you refuse to avoid the reality of God's wrath.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.920]   In your book, I counted nearly 800 explicit mentions of God's wrath, His judgment, and
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   vengeance.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.160]   Oh, I didn't realize that.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160]   Yeah, it's all over.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.500]   And I read a lot of books, and this emphasis is atypical, to say the least.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:58.080]   So how much of universalism thriving in Western Christianity is—how much of that is the
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.900]   result of God's wrath simply disappearing from contemporary Christian music and disappearing
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.440]   from the sermons and the books of influential preachers and authors and theologians?
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.600]   Well, I think that's a very good point, Tony.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:15.160]   I think that what happened—I mean, to talk about the American evangelical context from
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:21.040]   the 1980s, James Davison Hunter talked about what he called an "ethics of civility"
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.040]   to the younger generation.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.480]   These were people who were in their 20s back then, and they'd be in their 50s and 60s,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.360]   they'd be in leadership positions.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.760]   The ethics of civility, the number one rule is do not offend.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.760]   Don't offend people.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.560]   Well, hell is a deeply offensive doctrine.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.440]   And it'd be deeply offensive to many people attending churches.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.920]   I mean, if the minister got into the pulpit and expounded Matthew 25, "The sheep and
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.360]   the goats literally applied it," said, "Some of you are sheep, some of you are goats."
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.440]   I mean, imagine the reaction in our churches.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.280]   You can imagine how much more offensive it is to those outside of the church.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:59.880]   So I think we have to recover the willingness to speak of both sides of what Jesus taught
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:05.460]   about that there are not only benefits from being Christian, but there are consequences
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.560]   that follow from hearing about Christ and then deliberately rejecting the gospel.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.880]   We have to be willing to speak of that.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:17.040]   The Hebrew prophets, you know, they spoke of the consequence of turning away from the
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.260]   Word of God as well as the consequence of following it.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.120]   And that idea of the two ways that there are outcomes and consequences that follow on either
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.880]   side are important.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.440]   At the same time, we keep the emphasis on love.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.320]   You know, Scripture does not say, "For God so hated sin that he gave his Son," but "For
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.120]   God so loved the world."
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.840]   And so love is the actuating motive of the Father sending the Son.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.880]   And how does God show his love?
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.200]   It says, "He so loved the world that he gave his Son."
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:55.920]   The Son, Jesus, is himself the living expression, embodiment of the Father's love for us.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.960]   That was Michael J. McClymon from his office in St. Louis, Missouri, talking with us about
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.420]   his new 1,400-page magnum opus titled "The Devil's Redemption," a new history and interpretation
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.920]   of Christian universalism, now out from Baker Academic.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.400]   So grateful for his labors.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400]   What an accomplishment.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:21.240]   Well, Pastor John returns on Friday to field a question over whether or not he adds to
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.240]   the gospel.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.440]   And specifically, does John Piper add joy to the gospel?
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.680]   It's a good and fair question, and it's on the table next time.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.680]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.120]   Have a wonderful Independence Day celebration, and we will see you back here on Friday.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.120]   [END]
