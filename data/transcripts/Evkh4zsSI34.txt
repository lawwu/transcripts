[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Adam writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, recently at the Passion Conference in Atlanta, Georgia,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   I heard you say on stage that Romans 3.25 is the most important verse in all of the Bible. Why is that?"
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Well, I'm glad he picked up on it, because I did say that.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And actually what I said was, "It might not be, but if somebody put a gun to my head and made me choose,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   this is the verse I would choose."
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And here's my reason. Well, let me read the verse first, because not everybody will know what it is.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Romans 3.25 says, "God put Christ forward as a propitiation by His blood to be received by faith.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   This was to show God's righteousness, because in His divine forbearance He passed over former sins."
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I think that's the most important verse in the Bible.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Now, what in the world? Why would I say that?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Because it describes the two most amazing remedies for the two most horrific problems of mankind in the universe.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   So if you do a survey, "What's the biggest problem of mankind?"
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Very few people would say, "The wrath of God."
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   But it is. The wrath of God is the greatest problem.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And now here in this verse, you've got piece upon piece upon piece piled up as God deals with this problem.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So you've got God, you've got Christ, you've got "put forward," that's the Incarnation,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   you've got "by blood," that's the Atonement, you've got "propitiation," that's the heart of what happens in the Atonement
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   as God's wrath is removed and absorbed.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   You've got "for faith," which is the best news in all the world, because it's not works.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   You've got "vindicating God's righteousness," which means the just demand that He show wrath has been dealt with.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And you've got "because of passing over sins," which means the final wonder is He doesn't hold our sins against us.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I mean, I don't know any verse that packs as many glorious things into itself in dealing with the two worst problems.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So let me just underline that problem number one in the universe is God's wrath is on all human beings unto eternal damnation.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   John 3.36, "If we don't believe in Jesus, we remain, we remain."
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   That's forever. If we don't believe, we remain under the wrath of God.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Or Romans 3.5, where anger and fury are warranting God's wrath.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   God is righteous to inflict wrath on us.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   So those are the two things, God's wrath and His righteousness demands wrath.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's not just that God's angry. I mean, He could be some kind of flippant tyrant.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That's not the case. He is absolutely just and righteous in the wrath that He has against us.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So those are there in this verse behind the word "propitiation."
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Now, the remedies are, He shed His blood, that is, Christ shed His blood, and by shedding His blood, He propitiates the wrath of God.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So the flamethrower of God's omnipotent—I mean, we just need to ponder this—omnipotent fury, the flamethrower of God's omnipotent fury is,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   the trigger is about to be pulled, and as it's pulled, Christ steps between us and the flamethrower, and He absorbs every bit of it on Himself.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And He dies because of it, and we don't feel that heat at all. We are freed from it.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So the greatest problem in the universe is solved in this verse and spoken in this verse.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And the second one is that God is righteous to show wrath, and so how can He not?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And the answer is, He doesn't sweep sin under the rug. He deals with it in His Son, and therefore Jesus vindicates the righteousness of God.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   So He doesn't just remove the wrath of God. He vindicates the righteousness of God.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I don't know any verse in the Bible besides this one that says that at least so clearly.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And those are the two massive obstacles that have to be dealt with.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And then gloriously, it says, "to be received by faith."
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So I don't have to work for this. I don't have to perform for this.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I watch God perform salvation from God because He loves me, and I simply welcomed it.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I received that, and that honors Him as a covenant-keeping God.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   So on and on we could go in this verse, but there's the essence of it.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   The two biggest problems in the universe are solved with the two biggest remedies, and then it's just handed to us freely by faith.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yes, excellent. Well said, Pastor John.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And thank you for listening to this podcast.

[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Is an addiction to pornography an unpardonable sin? Is it unforgivable?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I look forward to Pastor John's thoughts on that tomorrow.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening and thanks for partnering with us.
