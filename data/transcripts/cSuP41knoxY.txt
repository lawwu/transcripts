[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.420]   - We are joined one last time by Dr. Richard Lentz,
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.100]   who serves as the Vice President for Academic Affairs
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.520]   and the Dean of the main campus
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.000]   of Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.340]   which is just north of Boston.
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.820]   Dr. Lentz is also the author of a fascinating book
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.940]   that releases this winter.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.200]   It's titled Identity and Idolatry,
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.420]   the Image of God and Its Inversion.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.080]   I want to turn and close this week,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.060]   this fruitful week, with the gospel.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.480]   But you mentioned busyness earlier in the week,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.520]   and I want to go back to that.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.560]   How does idolatry breed busyness?
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.320]   - I think busyness is a contemporary idol.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.020]   I'm not sure it was an idol in an earlier time.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.000]   You might say sloth was an idol of an earlier age,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.700]   although I don't want to deny that there are,
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.600]   there's this curious contradiction in modern life
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.400]   between busyness and sloth called entertainment.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.240]   And yet the circumstances of our lives in the West,
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.880]   outside of some smaller community,
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.560]   so I don't want to, again, overgeneralize
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.600]   that all communities and all cultural contexts of our time
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.140]   are saturated with busyness.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.140]   But I would say it is the dominant motif for most people,
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.560]   that we have a sense of too many things
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.800]   taking place in our lives,
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.240]   and if we could just slow down one sign of this
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.080]   in religious circles of all theological traditions
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.040]   is the move towards what we might call spiritual formation,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.280]   towards remembering Sabbath, the rest,
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.480]   slowing down, becoming a spiritual discipline.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.240]   That kind of movement, if you will,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.840]   is, it seems to me, just a response,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.360]   sometimes a good one, sometimes not,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.920]   a response to being overwhelmingly busy.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.480]   Now, busyness, again, is both a blessing and a curse.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.000]   Sometimes when you're busy, you actually accomplish much,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.760]   and we are called to do, we are called to be creatures
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.100]   who accomplish tasks.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.100]   We are not simply called to navel gaze in creation.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.040]   We are given mandates to be stewards of the created order.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.960]   So we are called to do, called to be active in that sense.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.680]   But there's a sense in which busyness
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.320]   is different than accomplishment,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.680]   and busyness is living, I think, on the surface of life,
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.680]   feeling like we are so far into the weeds of minutiae
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.960]   and small details that we never really tackle
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.800]   the big issues of life.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.560]   Sometimes we experience, I shouldn't say,
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.520]   sometimes mostly we experience our schedule
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.880]   as our master rather than vice versa.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.660]   That itself is just that indicator.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.660]   A parent of young children has so many things to do in life
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.240]   that probably aren't that important,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.600]   but they end up feeling like they have to do them.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.480]   They have to get them to the sports,
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.080]   they have to get them to the music lessons,
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.360]   they have to get them to,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.280]   and they're living constantly in the car,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.840]   they're constantly going from activity A to activity B,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.960]   and they feel overwhelmed,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.560]   and yet they can't get out of it.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.880]   Again, I wanna be careful to suppose
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.360]   that there's something fundamentally evil
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   about playing sports or engaging in music lessons.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.640]   But it's that desire to have everything for one's child
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.040]   that leads to this sense of never really having
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.680]   anything of significance.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.560]   And so we're so busy we can't get
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.040]   under the surface of our lives.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.760]   - Yeah, well, our time has been rich,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.620]   but it comes to a close.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.400]   As we go out, how does the gospel of the glory
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.880]   of Jesus Christ combat the work of idolatry in our souls
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.680]   and reshape our identity and truly satisfy our souls?
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.200]   How does that work?
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.440]   - Yeah, so the two parts to it.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.280]   So we're going from Genesis to Pentecost, if you will,
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   having spent most of our time in the golden calf narrative
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.800]   here in the conversation that is on idolatry,
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.320]   we need to be reminded that we are created
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   by a God who grants significance and safety,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.120]   that we are created to yearn for it,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.460]   to look for it, to desire it,
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.720]   and that it's found in our Creator,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.720]   a God who is deeply good, generous, gracious, just,
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.000]   all that which satisfies us is found in him.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.460]   Brokenness, then, is simply the story of looking
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.160]   for that significance and safety somewhere else.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.160]   The gospel, if you will, then is God's response
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.280]   to our brokenness and our yearning
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.160]   for significance and safety.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   So the gospel is the storyline that takes us
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.080]   into this, not simply a return to Genesis,
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.840]   not simply a return to the original state,
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.080]   but now runs us through the narrative
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.720]   of forgiveness, of grace,
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   and therein lies the deeply satisfying character
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.000]   of the gospel.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.360]   That is to say, it's not simply saying,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.440]   this is the way to find safety and security,
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.560]   but actually that safety and security
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   are now matters of grace,
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.920]   matters of God's generosity in a broken world.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.520]   And so it is deeper, it is richer
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.060]   than it was even in Genesis,
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.040]   by virtue of the fact that it overcomes our idolatries.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.240]   It doesn't simply break the power of our idols,
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.000]   it does, in part, but the dynamic of forgiveness
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   is itself an experience richer than we would have known
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.160]   had we not been broken and idolatrous.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.520]   There's something deeply satisfying
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.840]   about forgiveness in the human soul.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   Most of us know the experience of being forgiven,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.520]   it being a strange experience
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.880]   that's somehow deeply satisfying.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.080]   We don't want to seek it,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   we're afraid of being ashamed to admitting something wrong.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.640]   So when we've had a argument with a co-worker
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.120]   or with our spouse,
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.040]   our first intuition is never to admit fault,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.200]   but somehow, some way, when by God's grace,
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.560]   we ask for forgiveness, and it's actually granted,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.240]   there is nothing like that experience that satisfies us.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.240]   It is just deeply, emotionally healthy.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.720]   And so here is the gospel, if you will,
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.880]   that God's forgiveness is made known
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.080]   in the midst of our idols,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.700]   and therefore, out of His grace,
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.180]   the idols become less and less powerful in our lives.
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.340]   - Amen, beautiful.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.660]   Thank you, Dr. Lentz, our guest on the podcast this week,
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.140]   and the author of a forthcoming book
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.460]   titled "Identity and Idolatry."
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.660]   This has been a wonderful week,
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.300]   and this is the hope that we have in the digital age,
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.340]   that our eyes are so easily lured to idols, yes,
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.500]   but the glory of Jesus Christ is power
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.700]   to transform our hearts and to loosen our hearts
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.380]   from the idol-proneness that we see inside of us.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.300]   We've talked a lot about how, as followers of Christ,
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.180]   it is the glory of Jesus that shapes our identity,
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.500]   and we've seen that in passages
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.500]   like 2 Corinthians 3:18, 2 Corinthians 4, verse four,
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.220]   and for more on how this works,
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.140]   see the following episodes in the APJ series.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.100]   See our episode with Paul Tripp titled
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.140]   "Life is One Big Glory War," episode number 619.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.060]   See also "The Transforming Power of Christ's Glory,"
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.420]   an episode we recorded with Michael Reeves.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.180]   It's episode number 379.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.760]   And maybe right now you feel stuck in sin,
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.660]   and you feel like the idols of your life
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.780]   are looming large right now.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.700]   See episode number 477 with Pastor John.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.060]   It's titled "A Prayer for Those Who Are Stuck in Sin."
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.540]   This has been a rich, rich week with Dr. Lentz,
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.740]   and if you missed any of our five episodes with him,
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.480]   you can catch up on our mobile apps

[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.300]   I'm your host Tony Ranke.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.400]   I'll see you on Monday.
