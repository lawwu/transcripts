[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   we would come up to these rafts and these boats
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   that were in really dire shape,
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.440]   and people would be pushed off,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.920]   and people would jump off,
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.200]   and people would fall into the water,
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.440]   and some of them couldn't swim.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.200]   And so we found ourselves in this moment
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.000]   where we had a choice.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.240]   We could film someone drowned in front of us,
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.920]   or we could put our cameras down
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.480]   and pull them out of the water.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.480]   (air whooshing)
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.280]   - The following is a conversation with Sky Fitzgerald,
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.240]   a two-time Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.040]   who made the films "Hunger Ward" about the war in Yemen,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.080]   "Lifeboat" about the search and rescue operations
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.680]   off the coast of Libya,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.320]   and "50 Feet from Syria" about the war in Syria.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.160]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.280]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.480]   in the description.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.800]   And now, dear friends, here's Sky Fitzgerald.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.520]   Nearly 811 million people worldwide are hungry today,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.440]   and 45 million people are on the edge of famine
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.200]   across 43 countries.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.400]   How do you feel?
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.680]   How do you make sense of that many people suffering
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.320]   from hunger and famine in the world today?
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.080]   - I don't know if I can make sense of it, Lex.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.080]   I mean, I think it's deeply disturbing to me
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.760]   that as a global community,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.200]   we've allowed this number of people to go hungry
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.800]   when the food to feed them exists
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800]   and the resources to feed them exist.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.040]   I think the thing that disturbs me most about those figures
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.000]   is that many of those who are starving today
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   or going hungry today are the net result of war
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.480]   and intentional acts by leaders
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.280]   to starve entire populations.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.160]   And that's the most deeply disturbing part to me.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.680]   You know your history, and we all know that
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.680]   deeply embedded in the Geneva Conventions post-World War II,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.000]   the intent of one of those articles was to ban
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.080]   the use of starvation as a weapon of war
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.760]   because of what Hitler did during World War II.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.040]   That's been reiterated multiple times over the years
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.720]   in international humanitarian law, including in 2018
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.480]   because of the Saudi blockade over Yemen.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.320]   And yet to this day, starvation as a weapon of war
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.840]   continues to be used in Ethiopia,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.000]   obviously in Ukraine right now,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.080]   and in Yemen with the blockade over the country.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.520]   And that disgusts me that the law is in place,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.840]   but it won't be enforced by the international bodies
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.520]   and the nation states that make up
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.240]   the international community.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.960]   - So the starvation is a result of human actions,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.960]   human decisions that's especially painful to make sense of.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.440]   - For me personally, yeah.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.000]   I think that if you and I sitting here
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.480]   didn't eat for three days,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.560]   and had to lay our head on the sidewalk for a couple nights,
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.200]   I think we would take hunger
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   and homelessness a lot more seriously.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.120]   And I think that's, for some reason that's missing
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.560]   at this moment in history, tragically.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.160]   And I think until we can generate enough empathy
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.680]   that's immediate for all of us
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.120]   to understand what that means to go hungry,
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.480]   I'm not sure we're gonna sort of marshal
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.480]   the global community to solve it.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.600]   - I did just that, by the way,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.640]   fasted for three days recently.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.400]   It's fundamentally different, I think,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.880]   because the thing that would be terrifying to me
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.080]   is not the fasting, but the hopelessness
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.400]   at the end of the fast.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.720]   Like, I wouldn't know when the next meal is coming.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.360]   I always had the freedom to have the meal.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.360]   The fear, not just your own ability to eat and survive,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.840]   but your family's.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.920]   If there's loved ones,
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.440]   that's the other thing I don't have.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.560]   I'm single.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.840]   So I feel like the worst suffering
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.560]   is watching somebody you love
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.040]   that you're supposed to be a caretaker of,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.720]   and you can't take care of them.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.200]   And if all of that is caused by leaders
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.560]   as a weapon of war, that is especially painful.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.760]   So how can we help?
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.800]   What are the ways to help?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.400]   How do we alleviate this suffering?
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.720]   - Well, I think on the humanitarian front,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.440]   we have to be aggressive and attentive
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.160]   and intervene in significant ways.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.640]   And I think on the political front,
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.520]   we have to hold players accountable for their actions.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.280]   - So the leaders that start the war.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.240]   So when you say we have to speak up about the decisions
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.800]   and the humans making those decisions.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.640]   - Yeah.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.520]   - That lead to this situation.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.160]   - For example, let's make it concrete.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.200]   So when I was, I don't wanna jump ahead,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.520]   but when I was filming "Hunger Ward" in Yemen,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:30.000]   I met a mother who, when she gave birth,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.440]   weighed 70 pounds, the mother weighed 70 pounds.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   And so her daughter was starved in the womb.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.600]   When she was born, she was born into a world
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.160]   with no breast milk, very little formula.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.360]   So she was starved before birth.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.800]   She was born into a world where she continued
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.200]   to be starved by a mother who herself was starved.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.080]   I watched that child, her name is Asila,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.280]   die in front of me.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.720]   Asila had no chance for all those things we hope for,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.560]   for a child in this world.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.400]   She didn't have a chance to grow up.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.760]   She didn't have a chance to discover love.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.040]   She didn't have a chance to have a career.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.200]   She was robbed of all of those things
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.440]   because of the insidious nature of hunger
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.320]   that she was born into.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.800]   She didn't have to die.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.640]   She was not starving.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.840]   Her mother was being starved
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.040]   because of the blockade over the country.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.840]   Now, who instituted that blockade?
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.880]   MBS in Saudi Arabia with the reinforcement
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.400]   and sort of tacit approval of the United States,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.560]   our own government here.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.400]   And so there are people who are responsible
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.840]   for the starvation of children,
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.560]   and I think we need to hold them accountable.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.560]   Now, that's incredibly difficult to do,
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.680]   but just because it's difficult doesn't mean
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.480]   it ought not to be done.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.880]   - And we'll talk about many cases like these
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.000]   throughout history and going on today.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.200]   Let's talk about "Hunger Ward."
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.840]   - Yeah. - Let's dive in.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.880]   You've been nominated for an Oscar twice.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.440]   This is one of the times for a documentary.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.160]   Can you please tell me what "Hunger Ward,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.360]   The Last Hope Between War and Starvation" is about?
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.600]   - "Hunger Ward" is a short documentary
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.680]   that really is an attempt to illustrate
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.280]   the effects of the conflict on Yemen,
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.200]   specifically on civilians.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.760]   And we document it in both the North
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   and the South of the country
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.720]   because it's a bifurcated country.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.240]   The South is held by the globally recognized government
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.320]   in the South, which up until last week
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.280]   was run by, at least on the surface,
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.120]   by President Hadi, hold up in Riyadh.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   He was essentially removed from office last week
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   by, most people would agree, the Emiratis and the Saudis
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.720]   to put in place a presidential council.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.480]   So we wanted to show that starvation was happening
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.520]   in very similar fashions, both in the South and the North.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.480]   And we wanted to do this film
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.320]   because so few people in the West know anything
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.320]   about the conflict in Yemen, nor the US's complicity in it.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   And so my intent with the project
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.760]   was try to bring it to a larger Western audience
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.400]   as an attempt to intervene
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.160]   and change the political status quo,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.600]   which allows the use of starvation in Yemen to continue.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.200]   - So, US complicity, who are the bad guys?
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.520]   Now, the world, unfortunately, cannot be painted
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.680]   in black and white of good guys and bad guys.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.640]   But for the purpose of conversation,
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.640]   who is causing suffering in the world in this situation?
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.200]   Who started the war, why?
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.520]   And then, of course, the roots of war go back in history.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.600]   Let's start at the top.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.720]   - Well, there are bad actors
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.680]   and there are less bad actors, right?
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.920]   I mean, I think that's always the case in war, probably.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.560]   - And everybody loses in war.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.140]   - Yeah, I concur with that statement.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.080]   In the case of the status quo in Yemen right now,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.040]   it's a completely asymmetrical war.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.120]   And so the Saudi coalition,
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.320]   which is made up of primarily Saudi Arabia,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   the Emiratis, United States, France, Britain,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.760]   supplying weapons, but it's really driven
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.440]   and catalyzed by Saudi Arabia.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.960]   And it's asymmetrical to a great extent
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.720]   just because of the incredible firepower
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.080]   by air that the Saudis use continuously
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.880]   to pummel Northern Yemen.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.080]   When I was there, the sheer volume
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.760]   of airstrikes is hard to describe.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.900]   And we show the result of only one in the film, really.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.280]   But it's an asymmetrical war.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.200]   The de facto authorities of the North, Ansar Allah,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.040]   also known as the Houthi rebel group,
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.160]   they don't have an air force, right?
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.680]   They have a drone force, but they don't have an air force.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.880]   And so from a military standpoint,
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.840]   it's completely asymmetrical.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.620]   The Saudis really don't commit troops to the ground.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.160]   They use only proxies to fight on the ground.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.160]   - What is the narrative they use to justify a war?
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.320]   So there's a story on every side in war.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.040]   Some of it is grounded in truth.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.040]   Some of it is not at all grounded in truth,
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.040]   also known as propaganda.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.560]   What's the narrative used by the Saudis for this war?
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.680]   - The Saudi line is essentially that the Houthis
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.200]   are an illegitimate government,
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.680]   and that it's really a proxy war between Iran,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.620]   who supports the Houthis nominally,
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.200]   and the rest of the world.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.900]   That's the Saudi narrative.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.280]   The reality is something altogether different.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.520]   While the Houthis do receive support from Iran,
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.720]   this is a war started by and sustained by MBS
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.880]   in Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.720]   - Who's MBS?
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.320]   - Mohammed bin Salman.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.240]   - And who is he?
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.120]   - He is the son of the ruler of Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.640]   - What's his power?
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.680]   I'm asking basic, dumb questions.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.240]   - He's the de facto ruler.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.960]   - Of the military and--
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.840]   - Yes, he seized control of the country several years ago,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.720]   even though he, on the surface,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.320]   is not the ruler of Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.640]   He is, he's the crown prince.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   - And sorry to interrupt often, but who is he as a man?
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.680]   What's your sense of the man?
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.640]   - Yeah, so I've never met him,
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.620]   and I likely will never meet him, hopefully.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.600]   But he is, I know a lot about him through his actions,
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.640]   sort of in the MENA region,
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.920]   Middle East and North Africa region.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.040]   And he is one of three, in my view,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.400]   as an American sitting here in the US,
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.000]   three people in the world that I think
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.920]   has caused such an incredible volume of misery
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.680]   and suffering and murder on this planet
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.680]   that I think if he weren't around,
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.920]   the world would be a lot better place.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.020]   And I'm not a violent person by nature,
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.640]   but there are three human beings
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.160]   that I think the world would be better off without.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.880]   - Do you mind, before I ask other questions,
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.320]   mentioning the three?
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.400]   - Oh yeah, Assad is one in Syria,
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.280]   and that comes out of an earlier project
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.520]   that I did in Syria and Turkey.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.520]   And what I saw Assad as a ruler do to his own people.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.040]   And Putin would be the third.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:09.040]   Those three human beings are murderers on a scale
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.620]   beyond imagining.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.120]   On MBS, are you able to think as a documentary filmmaker,
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.060]   as a human being, as a scholar, as a thinker,
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.080]   with an open mind about a man like that
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.800]   who does evil onto the world
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.000]   and what that must feel like
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.040]   to be inside the mind of that man?
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.720]   So basically, consider his worldview.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.280]   With most evil people, with all people probably,
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.000]   but with people who do evil onto the world,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.200]   they think they're doing good.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.600]   - Yeah, they're the hero of their own story.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.440]   - Right.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.160]   And so to be able to place yourself,
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.880]   I feel like, for me, to understand a person,
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.200]   I have to literally, like the way actors
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.240]   kind of have to do,
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.240]   live inside the body of the person they're trying to study.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.160]   - Inhabit the character.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.640]   - Inhabit the person.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.060]   So are you able to do that,
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:06.060]   or because you are also studying the people who suffer
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.060]   as a result, as a consequence of their actions,
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.080]   you just, you put them in a box
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.040]   and you say, "I hate the person in that box.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.880]   "I'm going to move on."
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.720]   - This goes back to your black and white statement
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.740]   at the beginning, right?
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.320]   It's like, the world as a whole, of course,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.960]   is every gradation of gray, right?
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.080]   My background is theater, Lex.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.440]   And so I was trained long before I picked up a camera
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.240]   to inhabit other characters, right?
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.160]   I have two degrees in theater.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.560]   And so that level of sort of like
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.220]   walking in other people's shoes
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.320]   and trying to understand and empathize
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.160]   with their worldview is fundamental
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.000]   to how I live my life and how I do my work.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.200]   So in the case of those three that I named,
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.540]   Assad, MBS, and Putin, yeah, I can go there
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.800]   and think through how they came to be who they are, right?
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.360]   From afar, right?
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.880]   And after I go through that process,
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.920]   I still don't think there's any way
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.500]   that one can justify what they've done.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:14.440]   - We're going to talk about each of those people, sure.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.920]   - Well, I'm not an expert on any of them.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.920]   - You're a human being, which makes you
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.280]   a partial expert on human nature,
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.400]   'cause nobody's an expert.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.320]   You're just as good as anyone else.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.640]   Anybody who actually carries a camera
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.600]   and listens and observe others
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.120]   isn't especially an expert of human nature.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.520]   Who's willing to take that leap
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.280]   and truly understand somebody of any level, not leaders.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.620]   I feel like to understand a leader,
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.000]   you have to first understand humans.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.120]   And to understand humans, you have to see humans
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.200]   at their worst and their best,
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.240]   which is something that you've definitely done.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.400]   So let's stick on Hunger Ward.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.860]   This lens that you've chosen to look at this
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.520]   is through a single, maybe you can speak to that.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   You've mentioned the starvation as a result of war.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.440]   What is the documentary?
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.960]   Like, what is the lens you've chosen
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.560]   to give the world a peek at the results,
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.960]   at the suffering that's a result of this war?
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.720]   - People a lot of times will ask me
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.360]   after they've seen Hunger Ward,
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.720]   they ask where the hope is, right?
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.700]   You read the byline earlier, the lost hope.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:37.280]   And what I try to focus on in many of my films,
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.400]   including Hunger Ward, is in the very difficult context
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.680]   of war as the case is in Hunger Ward in Yemen,
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.320]   I look for hope and I look for inspiration.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.240]   And I do that through people who are doing incredible things
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.680]   under the most difficult circumstances.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.680]   So when I set out to do a film about starvation in Yemen,
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.200]   I mean, just listen to that statement,
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.000]   where's the hope there, right?
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.520]   And yet what I found, what I discovered were human beings
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.280]   that we could tell the story through
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.000]   who are incredible, inspirational human beings
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.960]   doing amazing things every day.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.840]   One of those is Makiya Maji, a nurse practitioner
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.400]   in the north of the country at a small rural clinic.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.000]   And another is Dr. Ayed Al-Sadiq,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   who is a pediatrician in the south of the country.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.680]   And so we chose to tell the story
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.280]   sort of through their experiences as caregivers,
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   devoting their lives to try to save this entire cohort,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.700]   this entire generation of children
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.720]   that has been born into starvation.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.000]   And that's an incredible, difficult task,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.440]   but equally inspirational to watch these human beings
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.360]   devote every minute of every day to save a child.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.160]   I mean, in my view,
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.360]   nothing is more important than that action.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.080]   - Maybe on that point real quick.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.400]   So there's suffering at scale, starvation at scale.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.040]   I mean, the numbers, maybe you can mention in Yemen,
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.400]   what are the numbers in terms of people in starvation,
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.160]   but from a perspective of a nurse practitioner or a doctor,
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.820]   you're treating one person in front of you.
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.320]   So how do you make sense of that calculus
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.000]   of like there's a huge number of people suffering,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.440]   and then there's just the person in front of you?
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.120]   Is that all we can do as humans
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.400]   is just to help one person at a time?
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.000]   Is that the right way to think
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.440]   and to approach these problems,
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.720]   or can you actually make sense of the numbers?
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.960]   - Speaking just as a human being,
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.480]   I think the scale of suffering is so great in Yemen
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:04.720]   that I think I'd be overwhelmed, right,
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.120]   if I focused on that scale.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.440]   You've probably heard that a child dies
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.080]   every 75 seconds in Yemen from hunger, right?
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.120]   So we've been sitting here, how long?
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.760]   You know, 35 minutes or so.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.240]   That's a good handful of children
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.400]   that have already passed away.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.440]   So to overcome sort of, I think,
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.720]   that danger of psychic numbing,
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.280]   which can happen when you think about suffering
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.120]   on such a large scale, as a filmmaker, as a human being,
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.960]   I have to focus in on the individuals,
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.120]   on those human beings in front of me.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.120]   And I think that's exactly what Dr. El-Sadiq and Makiya do
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.800]   to keep going each day.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.200]   And one of the amazing things
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   about these two healthcare providers
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.440]   that we showcase in the film
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.160]   is that they treat anyone who shows up, right?
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.200]   They don't have to have money.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.640]   They don't have to have any resources.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.560]   They just have to get to the clinic or the hospital.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.440]   And it's incredibly moving to see
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.840]   sort of the flexibility of their thinking
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.240]   in terms of how they make that work.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.680]   Makiya, for example, I saw her in the north of the country.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.800]   It's an incredibly rural clinic that she works at.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.520]   And so it's like a magnet for all the cases
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.920]   in the north of the country.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.960]   People come from hundreds of kilometers away sometimes
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.880]   for specialty treatment of pediatric malnutrition.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.120]   And one time I saw a child come in
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.440]   and it was a male relative that brought this young girl in.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.120]   And just because of sort of the gender dynamics in Yemen,
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.440]   there had to be a parent or a relative there
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.320]   to stay with the child while they're at the clinic.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.920]   And it was a male relative.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.280]   And so what many doctors in that instance would do
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.760]   would just turn them away.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.200]   And instead what Makiya did
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   is she walked into one of the rooms,
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.640]   talked to one of the other mothers
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.400]   and convinced them to become the temporary guardian,
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.560]   essentially, of this child
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.600]   until a female relative could arrive.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.160]   So she's flexible.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.320]   She finds solutions rather than allowing the problems
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.000]   to deter solutions.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.200]   - One child at a time.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.960]   - Yeah, yeah, one child at a time.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:21.400]   - You mentioned that you saw a child die in front of you.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.180]   So when you're filming this as a filmmaker,
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:32.000]   what's that like psychologically, philosophically,
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.600]   creatively as a filmmaker, as a storyteller?
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:43.880]   What do you do there as a human and as a filmmaker?
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.840]   Well, what's that whole experience like?
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.440]   Because you get to, like you said,
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.680]   you take it through the whole journey
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.640]   of a starving mother giving birth to a starving child.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.300]   - It's not something I wanna film.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:01.760]   It's not something that I certainly wanted to happen
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.740]   or seek out.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.060]   But it happened.
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.220]   And the sad truth is that it happens
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.260]   every week at that hospital.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.020]   And so when it happened in this instance,
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.900]   I felt an incredible responsibility
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.960]   to do justice to that reality,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.260]   to acknowledge that a child had just died
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.860]   of starvation-related causes,
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:31.860]   and to find some way, if the parents wanted us to,
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.540]   to integrate that into this story
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.420]   we'd bring back to a Western audience.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:44.420]   And I've filmed many difficult things over the years,
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:54.340]   and usually I really love filming.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.460]   And I didn't love filming "Hunger Ward."
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.440]   It was not a process that I enjoyed
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.980]   on any way, shape, or form, sadly,
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.260]   because of the content.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.940]   Because who wants to watch a child die in front of them?
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.300]   I don't.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.140]   But I did, and I had to.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.980]   And when that happened,
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.980]   I felt an incredible responsibility again to go deep,
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.220]   to go deep with that family,
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.060]   to tell the story of this hospital
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:27.460]   with every ounce of focus and talent
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.820]   that I could bring to the story,
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.300]   because people should know
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.020]   that children are dying of starvation right now
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.140]   as we sit here,
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.980]   and that that doesn't have to happen,
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.340]   and it is happening because of political dynamics
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.580]   that we can intervene on.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.720]   - Is there times you wanted to walk away,
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.660]   quit the telling of the story,
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.720]   come back to the United States,
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.140]   where you can just appreciate
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:04.300]   the wonderful comfort you can have
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.220]   just sitting there and having food
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:11.220]   and freedom to do whatever you want,
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.900]   those kinds of things?
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.420]   Doesn't have to be United States.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.620]   In a lot of places in the world.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.380]   - Well, that dynamic of sort of like survivor's guilt
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.900]   on some level definitely exists.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.900]   One of the hardest things,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.980]   well, filming Hungerport actually was eating,
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.300]   because we were in these malnutrition clinics,
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.460]   they're called TFCs, therapeutic feeding centers,
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.460]   where over a long period of time,
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:44.300]   children lost the ability to eat normal food,
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.100]   and couldn't digest it,
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.660]   and just were literally starving,
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.300]   and the practitioners were trying to bring them back
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.780]   to a state of thriving,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.140]   but to leave those clinics,
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.900]   and to go to our camp or to go to our hotel,
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.420]   and then to have access to food,
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.640]   'cause we could buy food on the streets and in the hotels.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.860]   I mean, it was a very intentional act
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.260]   throughout the course of the shoot
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.740]   to look at a piece of bread,
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.660]   or to look at a bowl of rice,
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.300]   and think about that child in the TFC,
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.900]   and think about how the privilege
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.500]   of having that bowl of rice that I could eat and digest.
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.020]   So it certainly, every day,
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:34.220]   helped me appreciate the privilege I had.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.460]   - Every bite you take.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.620]   - With every bite, absolutely.
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.660]   And so I wouldn't call it guilt,
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.820]   it wasn't exactly guilt,
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.140]   but it was definitely mindfulness.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:48.280]   - Meditate on the suffering of people who can't.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.660]   - That's right, exactly.
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.300]   So that knowledge, it was catalytic in some ways.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.100]   It sort of moved us forward,
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.220]   really wanting to shape the most powerful story we could,
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.260]   because we were surrounded by so much suffering every day.
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.520]   - How did filming that movie change you as a man,
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.860]   as a human being?
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.300]   You filmed a few difficult documentaries.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.700]   That one is a heavy one.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.640]   When you think of the person you were before you filmed it,
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.560]   and now when you wake up every morning
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.200]   and look yourself in the mirror,
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.320]   how is that person different?
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.440]   - Every documentary I do changes me in a different way.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.720]   I am not static in that sense, right?
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.120]   I'm preformed, it's like I change with every project
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.600]   because so many of them are difficult and challenging.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.080]   So in order to do them,
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.320]   I have to allow myself to change and be changed by them.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.920]   In the case of "Hunger Ward,"
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   you may remember the girl Omaima,
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.720]   who's the 10-year-old girl who we showcase
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.120]   in Odden in the south of the country.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:03.800]   We were there when she was admitted to the hospital.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.320]   When she was admitted,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.800]   this 10-year-old girl weighed 24 pounds,
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.300]   and she could barely stand up.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.920]   We started, with the permission of the family,
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.520]   to start to document her treatment
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.920]   and to see what would happen with this young girl
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.720]   who was so severely malnourished.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.600]   And we watched her be treated by the nurses and the doctors
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.160]   in Sadaka Hospital.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.880]   And slowly, over the course of a couple weeks,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.820]   we saw her change.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.200]   We saw her start to sort of gain strength
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.880]   and start to recover.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   And she also watched the caregivers very carefully.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.280]   And I watched her watch them.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   And I'll never forget,
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.040]   there was a moment where,
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:05.000]   about two and a half weeks, I think, into her treatment,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.720]   we walked into a room,
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.960]   and I saw her offering a capful of water
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.960]   to another younger child who was also starving.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.200]   The shot's actually in the film.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.260]   And so to see Omeima, this child who's starving,
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:27.120]   giving sustenance to a younger, more vulnerable child
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.640]   who was also starving, moved me deeply.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.960]   So I saw her learn from the caregivers around her.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.840]   And as a human being, as a filmmaker,
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.200]   I was incredibly inspired by Omeima.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.480]   - That capacity for compassion is there.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.560]   - Even within a 10-year-old girl who's starving, right?
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.380]   And so you asked what changed me.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.360]   That's one moment, right?
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.080]   Rather than being crushed by such heavy content,
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.640]   it was actually the opposite,
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.340]   where I came away inspired by a 10-year-old girl.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.200]   And I didn't anticipate that.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.360]   I didn't think that's what this content would do,
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.560]   but it's what it did.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.040]   It reinforced for me this incredible capacity
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.880]   we all have as human beings to do good,
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   to even within the most difficult of circumstances,
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.000]   to choose who we become and what we do.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.360]   And a 10-year-old girl taught me that
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.180]   or reinforced that for me.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:34.180]   - Were you able to feel the culture of the people,
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.360]   so the language barrier,
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.240]   were you able to break through the language barrier,
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.400]   the culture barrier, to understand the people?
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:48.980]   'Cause even suffering has a language of sorts,
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.640]   depending on where you are.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.480]   The way people joke about things, the way they cry,
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.680]   the way, this is an interesting thing
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.600]   I actually wanna ask you.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.500]   Sorry, I'm asking a million questions.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.720]   I find that the people,
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.040]   I've been talking to people in Ukraine and Russia,
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.480]   but in general, I've gotten a chance to talk to people
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.120]   who've been through trauma in their life.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:18.080]   And there's a humor they have about trauma and hard times.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:24.960]   It depends on the culture, of course.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.340]   Certainly Russian-speaking folk.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.360]   I mean, the more suffering you've experienced,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.680]   for some reason, the more they joke about it.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.000]   It's almost like they're able to see something deep
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.560]   about humanity now that they have suffered,
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.480]   and they're able to laugh at the absurdity,
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.280]   the injustice of it all.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.840]   And you could also say it's a way for them to deal with it.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.120]   But that humor has a kind of profound
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.000]   understanding within it
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.440]   about what it means to be human.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.840]   To really understand it, you have to know the language.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.360]   I guess I'm asking, were you able to really feel
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.720]   the humans and the other side of the language?
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.960]   - I'd like to think so.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.720]   I mean, as you noted, there are universals in life
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.440]   that transcend language, right?
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.860]   I mean, suffering is suffering.
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.240]   Love is love.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.640]   Compassion doesn't take place only through language.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.400]   It's through actions.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.600]   And so was there a language barrier?
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.280]   Absolutely, right?
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.960]   Did we try to bridge that through other means
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.280]   and sort of universal emotions and experiences?
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.120]   Absolutely.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.080]   That's one of the things I always think about
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.240]   when I'm filming is how do we distill down to universals?
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.640]   Through imagery, through the vocabulary of cinema,
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.440]   'cause I believe so deeply that
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.560]   that vocabulary should be visual.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.360]   - So the words, what's the most powerful way
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.260]   to express the universal?
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:07.920]   Is it visual or is it language words?
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.880]   - I think it's visual.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.680]   - And we're talking about the human face
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.320]   or human face, human body, everything.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.600]   - Through actions as well.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.960]   - Actions, so dynamic.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.120]   - I'm thinking about a woman named Salha in the film
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.120]   who isn't named, but you see her multiple times
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.000]   throughout the film, and she's basically
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.440]   the matron of the ward in this house.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.600]   And she's the gatekeeper for the ward,
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.040]   so no one enters that ward without her permission.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.080]   She's literally the gatekeeper at the door.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.040]   So no one comes in unless Salha allows them to come in.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.160]   But then she also is sort of like
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:47.920]   the first point of contact for compassion in the ward.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:51.560]   So when mothers and families are admitted,
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.560]   she forms relationships between the moms
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.560]   and the grandmothers, for example,
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.240]   who are admitted and who are living there on the ward.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.680]   And she does it through hugging, right?
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.400]   She does it through bringing them food, right?
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.280]   And she forms these really rather quickly
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.760]   deep relationships of compassion with the families.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.200]   And so it's amazing to watch,
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.080]   and no language is needed to bear witness to this.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   And she also suffers because of that, right?
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.340]   And so near the end of the film, if you recall,
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:35.960]   when another child dies and the mother is wailing,
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.080]   we actually cut away to Salha, who's in the hallway,
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.100]   who walks into another room and begins sobbing.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:47.280]   She's not a family member, but she has a deep relationship
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.380]   with that family that she forged
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.480]   as soon as they stepped into the ward.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.440]   So that's universal, right?
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.440]   To see a woman weep because a child has died,
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.560]   even if they're not related to that,
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.080]   that's a universal sort of emotion,
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.680]   experience we can all relate to.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.560]   So that's what I mean by visual vocabulary.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.920]   - And it's especially powerful
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.480]   because she has seen much of this kind of suffering,
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.080]   and she's still, maybe she has built up some callus
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   to be able to work day to day,
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:25.080]   but there's still an ocean underneath the ice.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.680]   - She's kept her heart open,
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.080]   despite all the pain that she sees and feels every day.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.040]   Somehow she's a human being who's able to do that,
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.400]   which is a very difficult thing to do, right?
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.120]   She still allows herself to be vulnerable,
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.500]   and maybe that's why she can do what she does.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.980]   - What lessons do you draw from other famines in history?
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.540]   So for me personally, one that's touched my family
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.120]   and one of the great famines in history is in Ukraine,
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.260]   Holodomor in the '30s.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.580]   - '32, '33, right?
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.820]   - '32, '33 with Stalin.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.780]   Maybe you could speak to the universals
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.100]   of the suffering here.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:09.860]   What lessons do you draw from those other famines,
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.260]   if you've looked at them, or in general about famine
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.260]   that are manufactured by the decisions of,
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.300]   let's say, authoritarian leaders?
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:29.740]   - Famine doesn't have to exist,
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.340]   or the bulk of famines on this planet, I believe,
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.940]   don't have to exist, and most of them,
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.540]   or at least a good number of them,
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.100]   are manufactured by the leaders
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.100]   that choose to use famine as a weapon,
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:49.100]   and Ukraine is one of the obvious examples right now
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.580]   with siege tactics that are happening
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.280]   in different parts of the country.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:36:02.000]   We built international humanitarian law for a reason,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.540]   many years ago, and it continues to be written to this day,
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.220]   and it's there to prevent what's happening
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.580]   in Ukraine right now.
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.220]   It's there to prevent what's been happening
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.420]   in Yemen for seven years,
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.900]   and yet there hasn't been any teeth behind it,
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.340]   and that's what disturbs me,
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:27.340]   is that we can see how these famines are being used
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:32.960]   as weapons in war, and yet we aren't using
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.100]   the levers of power that exist
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.940]   in order to, I think, to call out,
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.540]   in important and powerful ways,
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.020]   those who are causing them,
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.820]   and to make sure that we hold them accountable
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.660]   on the global stage.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:51.820]   Now, to some extent, that seems to be happening in Ukraine
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.340]   in a way that hasn't happened for a long time,
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.940]   and that gives me hope, right?
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.440]   And yet, I don't believe we've done enough,
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.140]   and I think the international community
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.700]   needs to do far more than we are,
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.000]   both in Yemen, in Ethiopia, and in Ukraine right now.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.700]   - There are certain kinds of things
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.140]   that captivate the global attention,
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.040]   and it seems like starvation is not always one of them.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.780]   For some reason, murder and destruction
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.260]   gets people attention more.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.480]   The death, of course, is easy to enumerate,
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.660]   but it's the suffering that's the problem.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.420]   - Yeah, yeah, you know, when we went to film "Hunger Ward,"
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.700]   that was one of the creative questions
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.340]   that I was really concerned about,
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:43.340]   because starvation, it's not a quick action, right?
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.380]   It's a long, slow, insidious process,
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.540]   just like hunger, right?
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.740]   And yet, when you're hungry,
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.380]   it takes you over.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.020]   It becomes the most important thing, right?
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.620]   It's just absolutely fundamental to life.
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.220]   It's like drawing breath.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.500]   And so I really, before I filmed "Hunger Ward,"
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.200]   I struggled to sort of answer
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.240]   how we could creatively approach that,
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.860]   because someone sitting in a clinic, right,
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.100]   starving, or being treated for starvation,
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.580]   that's a pretty static scene, right?
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:25.700]   And what we found was that because of the volume of cases,
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.500]   and because of the nature of sort of how quickly
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.220]   people were coming and going,
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.660]   is that it was more dynamic than we anticipated.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.980]   - And there's something also about starvation.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.420]   You get tired.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.660]   It's almost like it's a quiet suffering.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.660]   - Yeah.
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:48.260]   - Like, and by the way, there's something about,
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.140]   when I think about dark times,
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.300]   I mean, you'll hear me chuckle, for example.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.620]   I don't know what that is.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.540]   (Lex laughing)
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.500]   That's almost like,
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.280]   it's almost like you have to kind of laugh at,
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:07.700]   you can't help but laugh at the injustice
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.100]   and the cruelty in the world somehow
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.820]   that helps your mind deal with it.
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.220]   I mean, I see this all the time.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.420]   Like, when you're struggling, you can't feed your family,
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:21.420]   you lost your home, the last thing you have is jokes about--
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.460]   - It's humor.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.300]   - Yeah, it's humor.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:27.540]   It's like, ah, the fucking man fucked me over again.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.380]   (Lex laughing)
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.980]   And there's jokes all around that.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.820]   - Yeah.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.820]   - And then you laugh and you drink vodka and you play music.
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.260]   I don't know what that is.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.260]   I don't know what that is.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.540]   - It's gallows humor, right?
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:44.340]   It's a way of, I think, simultaneously acknowledging
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.780]   and allowing yourself to move forward, right?
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.820]   Beyond the pain and the suffering.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.780]   - So you mentioned Ukraine and you mentioned Putin.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.780]   What are your thoughts about the humanitarian crisis
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.700]   and generally the suffering that's resulting
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.420]   from the war in Ukraine?
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.980]   - Well, first off, I think the conflict
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.980]   is just gonna exacerbate the global challenge we have
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.940]   with displacement.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.560]   The last entire trilogy I did was about displacement
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.540]   to a great extent due to war.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.060]   And this is a huge displacement of human beings,
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.740]   regardless of the cause.
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:29.260]   And that is gonna sort of have a ripple effect
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.020]   across the globe for many, many years to come,
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.980]   regardless of even if the conflict ended today.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.060]   So there's that, that's gonna set up a whole nother strain
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:42.580]   on sort of the global sort of resources
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:47.780]   that come into play to deal with refugees.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.860]   You know, there were 79 million displaced people
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.140]   on this globe prior to the Ukrainian conflict, right?
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.580]   You probably know the numbers better than I do
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.340]   in terms of what the current estimates are
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.820]   for displacement from Ukraine.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.940]   - It's four to six million.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.220]   - So what are we up to now?
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:07.060]   73, 74 million individuals on this planet now
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.260]   who are displaced?
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.820]   That's a significant bump.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:16.220]   I wish that the levers of power were used differently
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.640]   in situations like Ukraine and Syria, for example.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.380]   - So what are the levers of power?
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.780]   - Well, military might, let's take that for one, right?
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:31.780]   So I have always felt after working in Syria and Turkey
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:39.500]   that we completely missed our opportunity
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:44.420]   as a player on the global stage with military capability
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.740]   to prevent the killing of hundreds of thousands
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.900]   of civilians in Syria.
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.700]   We had the ability and we didn't leverage that ability.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:59.700]   You know, the fact that I talked with so many Syrians
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.060]   during the course of doing that project
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:07.060]   who told me their stories of living in their house, right?
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:12.500]   And having a Syrian helicopter fly over their house
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.100]   and drop a 55-gallon drum full of explosives and shrapnel
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:24.100]   in their neighborhood over and over and over again.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.620]   Not focused on any military targets,
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.540]   only meant to kill and sow fear, right?
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:35.540]   And early in the conflict, we could have stopped that.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.060]   Before Russia got involved, we could have intervened
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.820]   and created a no-fly zone.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.940]   - We, the United States.
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.820]   - We, the United States, or a coalition
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.340]   that we were a part of, yeah.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.600]   And we didn't do it.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.620]   And we could have, and I think that's an example
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.220]   where we have the military capability to actually do good
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.460]   in a situation like that.
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.740]   And we don't usually use it for those purposes.
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.700]   And I think that's what a military ought to be used for
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.100]   beyond just defending our borders,
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.380]   is to save others with the privilege
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.900]   that that power affords.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.500]   - What do you think about the power of the military
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.220]   versus the power of sanctions
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.240]   versus the power of conversation?
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.980]   - They're all different tools, right?
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.500]   To be used at different moments.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:20.500]   But if words fail, if sanctions fail, right?
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:24.140]   I think there are moments in history
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.380]   where power is justified, right?
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.180]   And I think Syria was one of them.
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:31.940]   I think when barrel bombs were dropping
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.760]   on civilian neighborhoods for months and months and months
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.420]   with no intent to do anything
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.100]   other than kill Syrian civilians,
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.580]   that's an instance, I think, where might is justified
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.380]   to shoot those helicopters out of the sky.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.700]   - Here's the difficult thing.
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.500]   We talked about Yemen.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:53.140]   Where's the line between good and evil
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:56.860]   for US intervention in different countries
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.580]   and conflicts in the world?
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:02.340]   It's easy to look back 10, 20, 30 years
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.760]   to know what was and wasn't a quote unquote just war.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.860]   In the moment, how do we know?
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.300]   - I think it's incredibly difficult to answer that, right?
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.820]   And I think that's why leaders make the wrong choices
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.380]   so often, right, is they second guess themselves.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:22.420]   I think you take all the data at your fingertips,
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.380]   all the intelligence that you have, right?
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.740]   And you look at it all very carefully
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.780]   and you make a decision, right?
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.160]   There are some instances, though,
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.780]   where it's very clear what's happening, right?
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.140]   And leaders still don't act, right?
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.380]   In Yemen right now, for example,
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.620]   it's very clear what's happening, right?
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.280]   Children are being starved because of a blockade.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.020]   All the US would have to do is ensure that blockade,
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.980]   now there's a two-month ceasefire in place now,
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:54.700]   but remains lifted beyond the ceasefire
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.980]   and children will stop starving.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.540]   That's pretty simple.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.940]   You can trace, it's a direct connection.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:05.020]   And we haven't had the sort of the moral wherewithal
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:08.100]   to make that decision because we're too interested
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.960]   in maintaining positive ties with Saudi Arabia
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.460]   where oil flows from and so much influence,
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.700]   because Saudi Arabia has so much influence
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.940]   throughout the MENA region,
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.180]   we want to keep that relationship tight
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:26.380]   despite sort of the moral wounds that come from that.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:30.620]   - About half the world is under authoritarian regimes.
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.420]   Everybody operates under narratives.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.820]   And there's a narrative in the United States
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.920]   that freedom is good, democracy is good.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.560]   I have fallen victim to this narrative.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.680]   I believe in it.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.600]   I'm saying this jokingly, but not really.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.080]   Because who knows the truth of anything in this world?
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:57.020]   I eat meat, factory farm meat,
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.760]   and I seem to not be intellectually
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.580]   and philosophically tortured by this, and I should be.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.960]   There's a lot of suffering there.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:09.280]   What do we do to lessen the suffering
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.580]   of the people under authoritarian regimes?
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:16.280]   Again, the same question, military conflict,
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.720]   diplomacy, sanctions, all those kinds of things.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:28.560]   Does that lessen suffering or increase the suffering
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.240]   from what you see in Yemen?
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:36.260]   Is it something that has to be healed across generations
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.240]   or can be healed on a scale of months and years?
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.120]   - I'm just a guy with a camera, Alex.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.520]   But as a guy with a camera,
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:48.900]   I've seen a lot of things in a lot of places.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:54.340]   And I've seen the effects these decisions made
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:59.280]   by authoritarian leaders have on their own citizens.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.520]   And that's what drives my thinking on this.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:08.320]   And that's what drives and motivates me each day
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:12.440]   to raise the red flag through my films and say,
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:17.440]   listen, Biden, you campaigned for president
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:23.480]   in part on a platform that said
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.920]   that we would regain our prominence
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.280]   on the moral stage of the world, right?
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.220]   And that we would prioritize, right?
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.360]   Sort of a moral paradigm over relationships
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.480]   with authoritarian regimes, Saudi Arabia being one, right?
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.720]   And yet when the CIA report came out
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.740]   that clearly articulated in detail
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:52.080]   that MBS was responsible for Khashoggi's murder
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.240]   and for cutting his body into pieces
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.260]   and probably burning it in the backyard of the embassy,
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:59.260]   what did Biden do?
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:03.140]   He didn't really make a pariah out of MBS
[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.960]   like he said he was going to, right?
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.640]   What if he'd done something else
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.920]   and actually done what he said he was gonna do,
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.760]   which was make him,
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.360]   what if he had would remove the ability for MBS
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.120]   to fly to the United States, for example?
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.760]   Now that's a sanction, right?
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.440]   That's a sanction that's individual and concrete
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.840]   and would be hugely embarrassing for MBS.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.040]   That would have been Biden saying,
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:31.920]   this is unacceptable behavior, right?
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.260]   This is something which because you executed
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.340]   such a horrendous act on someone living
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.620]   in the United States, right?
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:46.620]   We are not going to give you a stage here at least, right?
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.660]   Within the borders of our country.
[00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.840]   Those are the things that leaders can do
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.780]   that I don't think they do often enough.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.260]   And certainly our leader right now isn't doing it
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.780]   in the way I wish he were.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.440]   He certainly has taken a different stand on Ukraine.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.580]   You know, and been very vocal,
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.900]   but there's so many instances we could talk about
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:10.540]   where I feel like the political gamemanship, right?
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.920]   Often falls into maintaining relationships
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.660]   like with MBS and Saudi Arabia,
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.340]   rather than doing the right thing.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.440]   Rather than as a nation, a leader of a nation saying,
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.920]   this is unacceptable.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.820]   We have a higher standard than this.
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.780]   'Cause I think when leaders do that,
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:31.060]   it becomes aspirational, right?
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.420]   It becomes aspirational for other leaders
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.620]   in the progressive world at least.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:39.060]   And also it rings the alarm bells
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:42.140]   for other authoritarian leaders and says,
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.620]   you know what, there are lines, right?
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:46.660]   There are things that can't be done
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.580]   or there will be significant consequences.
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:51.660]   Like you will not be able to fly into our airspace anymore.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.860]   And sanctions I think need to be concrete
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.460]   and individual to some, in addition to the larger scope.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.820]   But when they're concrete and individual,
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:04.860]   I think often they're felt in a different way.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.260]   - You mean felt obviously by the individuals
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.860]   and so the ripple effects of that
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:17.060]   might have the power to steer the direction of nations.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.900]   - Because of the nature of authoritarian regimes, right?
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.220]   - Individuals have so much power.
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.060]   - Exactly, right.
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:29.300]   So if Putin is put on trial in The Hague at some point
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.580]   or at least there's the threat of that, right?
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.820]   Now that's likely never to happen of course,
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.660]   because someone has to be in custody to go on trial, right?
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.740]   And he's never gonna allow that to happen.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:44.740]   But just knowing that that danger exists
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:49.380]   is going to change his travel plans in the future, right?
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.420]   MBS not being able to fly to the US,
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.300]   he's gonna feel that and be embarrassed by that.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:01.300]   So I think they have a special meaning and consequence
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.020]   in authoritarian regimes because of that.
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.100]   - So you said you're just a guy with a camera.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:06.940]   - Yeah.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:12.780]   - I would say you're a brilliant guy with a camera.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:15.980]   I'm also a kind of guy with a camera.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.020]   - You're a guy with a couple cameras.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:17.860]   - A couple cameras.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.420]   - And a couple mics too.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:20.420]   (laughing)
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.380]   You got a couple mics, a couple cameras,
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.220]   a robot over here.
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.620]   - When you can't beat 'em with quality,
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.300]   you bring the quantity.
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.500]   - That's right.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.380]   - So to me, that's also an interest,
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:36.100]   partially because I also speak Russian and a bit Ukrainian.
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:39.900]   I wanna study that part of the world.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.620]   I wanna talk to a lot of people.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:42.860]   I wanna talk to the leaders.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.540]   I wanna talk to regular people.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:48.700]   To be honest, and I would love to get your comments on this,
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:51.380]   the regular quote-unquote people
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.460]   are way more fascinating to me.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.540]   As a filmmaker, how do you figure out
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.340]   how to tell this story?
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.300]   I'm sure a guy with a camera,
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.420]   you're looking at war in Ukraine,
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.920]   but also what's going on in Yemen, in Syria,
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.140]   and other places in the world.
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.380]   I mentioned North Korea.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.260]   That's a super interesting one.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.740]   Hard to bring cameras along.
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:16.580]   China, in Canada, the truckers,
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.460]   there's all kinds of fascinating things
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.780]   happening in the world.
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:23.780]   So you, as a scholar of human suffering
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.020]   and human flourishing,
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:28.300]   how do you choose how to tell the story?
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.140]   - How do I choose a story?
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.220]   How do I choose how to tell the story?
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.440]   - Both the story and how, I assume those are coupled.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:38.100]   So how do you choose which story to tell,
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.620]   and how do you choose how to tell that story?
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:45.640]   - Well, in terms of how to choose which story,
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:51.200]   it's a bit of a mystery potion for me, frankly.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.560]   I go off on instinct,
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.240]   but there's also a highly intentional
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.160]   piece of it for me as well.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.340]   And the intentional piece is,
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:06.880]   I guess I'd call it the do I care threshold,
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.520]   or the so what threshold.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.280]   - You personally, just something in your heart
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.460]   just kind of gets excited or hurts,
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.720]   or just feels something.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.400]   - So one of the things that disturbs me
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.760]   about American culture, Lex,
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.400]   is that we seem to be a people
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.160]   that's fascinated by reality television, for example.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.680]   Like look at how many of us here in America
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.200]   watch reality television, right?
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.560]   That deeply disturbs me.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.260]   Not that I've never watched an episode,
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:36.920]   I've shot a whole season of it once to make a living, right?
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.440]   So it's like I know it, right?
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.500]   But I feel like the things we should be paying attention to
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.680]   are the things, personally,
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.760]   are the things I choose to film, right?
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:53.760]   As a human being, as a dad, as a filmmaker,
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.760]   I think we should be paying attention
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.480]   to the fact that children are being starved in Yemen.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.120]   I think we should be paying attention
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.860]   to the fact that Ukrainians are being displaced
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.200]   by the millions.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.680]   So there's this so what threshold that I use.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.160]   And I feel like it has to be a topic
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.380]   that if we don't cover,
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.720]   and we don't put out in the world
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.800]   in the largest possible way,
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.240]   in the hope of intervening,
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.960]   in the hope of marshalling maximum resources
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.400]   and attention to solving the problem,
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.480]   that's what I'm dedicated to as a filmmaker.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.860]   Because I didn't pick up a camera initially
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.520]   to film puppy dogs, right?
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.140]   To make people smile.
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:37.120]   I believe the camera is a tool for change.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:40.800]   I believe the camera is a powerful tool
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.700]   that we can use to raise awareness
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.920]   and marshal resources and help people understand
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.740]   the impact that these geopolitical decisions have
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:52.400]   on real people's lives.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.400]   And that's the intent I create each film with.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.980]   Now, how I choose each story,
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:02.500]   that's the magic potion piece of it, right?
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.460]   And often one flows rather organically
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.280]   into another, frankly.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.780]   - So you just kinda, like you said,
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.540]   you go with instinct a little bit.
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.540]   - To some extent, but oftentimes I choose the next project
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:17.580]   based on relationships I've developed in the last film.
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.180]   And so one often flows into another
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:22.460]   through relationships I develop,
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.100]   and then a colleague will share a detail
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.900]   about something that's happening in a certain place,
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:31.340]   and I'll go, "Hmm, really, I didn't know that."
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:34.380]   And usually it's before it's hit the world stage
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.380]   in a big way.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.300]   And so I start to do due diligence,
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.860]   and often that, it reveals it to be a much bigger
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:44.180]   and more pressing topic that I wanna learn more about.
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:50.660]   - Before I talk to you about Syria and lifeboat,
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.040]   you mentioned a camera's the best weapon.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.980]   Maybe just--
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.260]   - Well, it can't take out a tank,
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.700]   but it's a good weapon. - Second, top three.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.620]   I love the humor throughout this.
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.660]   I really appreciate it.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.540]   We're talking about such dark topics,
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:13.540]   but it resets the mind in a way that allows me to think.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.340]   So thank you.
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:22.580]   As a filmmaker, I almost wanna talk
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.860]   about the technical details.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.700]   - Uh-oh.
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:31.260]   - How do you choose to shoot stuff?
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.700]   Again, so maybe you can explain to me.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.940]   I work with incredible folks
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:41.940]   that care about lenses and equipment and so on.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:47.860]   I tend to be somebody that just wants to kinda
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:52.740]   go as like a guerrilla shooting,
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:58.540]   not plan too much, just go with gritty.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:01.100]   I'm trying to come up with words that sound positive.
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:02.220]   (laughing)
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:04.020]   Do a positive spin on what I try to do,
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:08.700]   but gritty, don't over plan, use.
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:11.020]   We had a big discussion if you see this light.
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:12.660]   - Yeah.
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:15.740]   - It's on a stand that's a very ghetto stand.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:17.460]   - Yeah, you need a sandbag on that, man.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:21.100]   - Exactly, so no sandbag.
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.860]   And the stand is actually bending
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.300]   under the weight of that thing.
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.420]   - It could fall on us.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:27.260]   - It could fall.
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.100]   - It probably won't reach us, but it could fall.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:30.980]   - But the danger, live under that danger,
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.420]   embrace that danger, love it.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.500]   Because that thing is easier to transport
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.140]   than a heavier one.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:40.300]   Sandbag, that's extra weight.
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.860]   So if you keep, people tell me,
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:44.660]   there's the right way to do stuff.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:47.900]   Like here's these giant cases with all kinds of padding
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:49.300]   for transporting stuff.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.460]   I transport most of the equipment in a garbage bag.
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:56.220]   So that's just a preference because that's somehow,
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:00.660]   that chaos allows me to ignore all the stupidity
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:04.780]   of loving the equipment and focusing on the story.
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:09.780]   So that said, I've never shot anything worthwhile.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.820]   (laughing)
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:17.700]   There is power to the visual, definitely.
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:22.700]   And so finding a certain angle, a certain light,
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:24.380]   whether it's natural light
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.400]   or additional artificial lighting,
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:30.060]   just capturing a tear, capturing,
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:34.300]   when the person forgets themselves for a moment
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.060]   and looks out into the distance,
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.820]   missing somebody, thinking about somebody.
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:41.340]   All of those moments you can capture,
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:45.260]   a lens, a camera can do magic with that.
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.780]   I don't even know the question I'm asking you,
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:51.500]   but how do, both technical and philosophical,
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:54.540]   how do you capture the visual power that you're after?
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:59.300]   - Yeah, so many of my films, I think,
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:03.340]   are built on the premise of access, right?
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.060]   Built on this notion that
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:12.620]   the biggest hurdle to the story is getting there,
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:17.620]   being there in the room or being there on the boat
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:20.220]   while a crisis is unfolding.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.540]   And that access typically is really nuanced
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:26.380]   and difficult to gain.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:29.260]   And then trust flows from that, right?
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:32.180]   'Cause usually it takes a long time to gain that access.
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:35.700]   Because that access is so hard fought,
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:42.340]   it necessarily informs how we film, right?
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:47.700]   To be in a room at Sadaka Hospital in Southern Yemen,
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:51.100]   I can't have five people in that room, right?
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:54.500]   I can't have a boom mic over a scene.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:59.580]   I want, creatively, the opposite of that as well.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.340]   So it's not just a logistical question,
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.540]   it's also a creative question.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:08.420]   To capture intimate moments where families are dealing
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.740]   with suffering children and dying children
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:14.660]   and caretaking is active and ongoing all the time,
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.660]   you don't wanna interrupt that moment.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.740]   And so that informs how I do things.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.660]   So we go fleet and nimble and small.
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.780]   - Those are all really good words for--
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.420]   (laughing)
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.740]   - So it's logistical on the one hand,
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.820]   but it's also a creative choice, right?
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.860]   So when we filmed "Hunger Ward,"
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:34.500]   it's two people were filming the entire film, right?
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.580]   Me and my director of photography.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.980]   - Those are the two people in the room?
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.040]   - Two people in the room. - That's it.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.980]   - Yeah, that's it, the whole film, right?
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.260]   We had a field producer as well
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.120]   and he's part of the country,
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.300]   but in terms of camera, it's just two people.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.260]   And we're doing everything and we have lenses
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.740]   that are long enough that we don't have to move
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.660]   to capture the film.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.660]   So we can tuck into a corner sometimes, right?
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.340]   - And so just what's long mean?
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.980]   That means they're standing farther away
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.340]   and they can-- - Zoom lens.
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.860]   It's not a prime lens, so it's not a fixed focal length,
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.940]   right, 'cause a fixed focal length,
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.780]   you have to move a lot more in order to capture action.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:12.780]   With a zoom lens, maybe a 105 at the long end,
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:16.880]   I can tuck into a corner and just film from 15 feet away
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.020]   instead of having to get right up on someone, right?
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:22.000]   So you're less likely to interrupt the scene
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.980]   and you can kind of become the fly on the wall sometimes.
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:30.260]   So I'm very intentional about that piece of it
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:33.580]   so that we can capture those vulnerable moments
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:34.740]   and not interrupt them.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:39.740]   - That's really fascinating too, 'cause the access,
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.940]   I don't often think about this,
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.940]   but that's probably true for me as well.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:50.720]   Part of the storytelling is to be in the room.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.720]   - And that's the hard part.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.400]   For me, most of my films, that's the hardest part,
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.960]   actually, as hard as "Hunger Ward" and "Lifeboat"
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.400]   were to film and "50 Feet From Syria,"
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.760]   the getting there piece of it for the last two
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.200]   was much harder.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.020]   - Yeah, and it's also, it's a creative act.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.560]   I don't know if it is for you,
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.560]   but it's the kind of people you talk to.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.640]   It's like how you live your life.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.080]   Like the kind of people I talk to right now,
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.760]   they steer the direction of my life
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.640]   and steer the direction of things I'll film.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.340]   So it's not just like you're trying to get access,
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:30.760]   it's everything.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.320]   Like it builds and builds and builds and builds.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.440]   - It builds on itself, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.820]   - I mean, part of the thing, even saying,
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.160]   talking about some of these leaders
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.860]   and conversations with them,
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:45.000]   it's almost like steering your life
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.840]   into the direction of the difficult,
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.160]   of like taking the leap.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.840]   And if you're a good human being,
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:00.480]   and a lot of people know who you are as a human,
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.160]   like not as a name, but as really who you are,
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.960]   that like putting that attention out there,
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.000]   it's somehow the world opens doors
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.300]   where the access becomes,
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:18.580]   the access that was once seemed impossible becomes possible.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:21.060]   And then all of that is a creative journey
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.180]   to be in the room.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.620]   I think it probably is,
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.620]   I mean, it's true even for fiction films probably,
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:30.220]   is like everything that led to that,
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.860]   like to be in the room,
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.060]   the journey to be in the room and to shoot the scene
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.740]   is maybe more important than the scene itself.
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.840]   And like really focus on the creative act of that.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.960]   Yeah, that's really fascinating.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.000]   And especially, I mean, with a documentary,
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.720]   you get one take.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.000]   - Yeah, you can't say, "Hey, reset," right?
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.120]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.160]   - God, that is so interesting.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.000]   As you were in some of the most difficult parts of the world
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.800]   in the room with some of the most difficult stories
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.080]   to be told.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.800]   - And yet, I think that's why I keep doing these stories.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.040]   Because once you have that lived experience, for me,
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:16.860]   it's moving.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.860]   It moves me to bear witness to these inspiring people
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:26.780]   under difficult circumstances.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:31.780]   And I can't come back to the US afterwards
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.860]   and walk down the grocery aisle
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:40.420]   where there's 50 different choices for canned peas, right?
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:45.300]   And not sort of feel that lived tension, right?
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.500]   That lived tension of the privilege
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.420]   that I have here in the US.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:52.300]   And then I have a choice about what to do
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.220]   with that privilege, right?
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.700]   And the last thing I wanna do is start
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:01.340]   doing stories about dandelions, right?
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:02.940]   There's far more important things to do
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.920]   on this very limited time that I have on the planet.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:10.920]   And I think that's catalytic for me.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:17.660]   I feel that mortality each day.
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:22.660]   And my goal is to tell as many of these stories
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:26.900]   before I'm gone.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:30.980]   - Could you speak to the getting access?
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:36.180]   Is this just, is there interesting stories
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:41.180]   of how a weird or funny or profound ways
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:45.100]   that led you to get access to a room?
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.860]   - Each one is a different adventure.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.060]   And it's definitely-- - It's an adventure.
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.860]   - Everyone's an adventure, yeah.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.820]   Probably one of the easiest ones I ever had
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.980]   in the recent past was for "50 Feet From Syria,"
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:59.980]   where I literally broke my hand in a bicycle race.
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:06.040]   And after many months of trying to get an appointment
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.180]   with an orthopedic hand surgeon, a specialist,
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.660]   I finally did and he was Syrian American.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.820]   And the Syrian conflict had just begun
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.620]   and we just started talking about it.
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:21.060]   And after he looked at my hand in the first five minutes,
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.460]   he's like, "Yeah, you need surgery."
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:23.300]   Right, and we're great.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.900]   But then somehow we started talking about Syria.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.420]   And like five minutes in, he just stood up
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.740]   and put the privacy curtain around us.
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:33.060]   Supposed to be a 15 minute appointment or so.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.380]   And we talked for an hour, right?
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:40.380]   So those moments of sort of mysterious confluence happen.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.700]   Right, and I think you have to be open to them
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.540]   when they do happen.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:46.460]   Because I'm a storyteller, I'm always looking as well.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:50.420]   Right, so because he then contacted me later and said,
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.820]   "Sky, I am going back to the Syrian border
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:55.220]   to volunteer as a surgeon.
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.500]   Do you want to come with me?"
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.380]   That was an easy one.
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.900]   That's probably the easiest one I could give you.
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.140]   But it came out of this interesting moment,
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.820]   very personal moment, right?
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.720]   Lifeboat and Hunger Ward were completely different.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:10.360]   And I had to really work hard
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.340]   to gain access to those stories.
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.140]   - So you intentionally thought like,
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:18.260]   I want to get access to this story.
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.420]   And then what are the different ideas?
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:24.420]   And they often might involve a doctor or a dentist.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:29.420]   Or just being maybe intentionally and aggressively open
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:34.260]   to experiences that lead you into the room.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:38.860]   So it's funny you mentioned the doctor,
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.680]   'cause I have similar experiences now.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:47.660]   I've just gotten access to all kinds of fascinating people
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.700]   in the same way.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.780]   - They're all around us.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:51.620]   - They're all--
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:52.440]   - They're all around us.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.280]   You just have to look, right?
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.100]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.500]   - It's like there's fascinating people everywhere
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.220]   who are doing incredible things.
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:59.460]   But we have to be open and keep our eyes open
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:04.180]   and realize that there are amazing human beings everywhere.
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:07.720]   - Yeah, there's networks that connect people
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.100]   just through life.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.540]   You meet people, you share a beer or a drink,
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.460]   or just you fall in love,
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:18.600]   or you share trauma together,
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.940]   or you go through a hard time together.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.580]   And those little sticky things connects us humans.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.820]   And if you just keep yourself open
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.860]   and embrace the curiosity.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:30.020]   And then also the persistence, I suppose.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:35.020]   Like if you, like how long have you chased access?
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:39.620]   Does it take days, weeks, months, years?
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:43.060]   - Lex, I'm not the most talented filmmaker in the world.
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.140]   I'm not the smartest guy in the world.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.360]   I think if there's qualities that have served me well
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.200]   in my career, it's persistence and tenacity.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.800]   I've always been sort of a slow burn human being.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:03.240]   I would never hit a home run, but I hit a first, right?
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.560]   A single to first, and then I'd hit another single to first.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.460]   So I ran a marathon when I was 18,
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.520]   and I think that is illustrative
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.460]   of sort of how my career has been.
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.040]   I just keep going.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.640]   And I believe in this notion of incremental evolution,
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.960]   that with each project, I try to learn from it
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:28.160]   and take away lessons learned and improve my craft, right?
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.960]   And improve how I leverage that craft
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.280]   and improve how I tell the story
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.860]   from a narrative standpoint each time.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:41.800]   So that on the next project, it's a little bit better.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.720]   And that's the arc of my career
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.420]   is learning, learning, evolving, evolving,
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.500]   so that I can make a little better film the next time.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.420]   - How do you gain people's trust?
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.500]   Like for example, there's a line
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.520]   between journalists and documentary filmmakers.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.340]   Nobody really trusts journalists.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.280]   (laughing)
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.820]   - Yeah, right, exactly.
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:07.020]   - But a documentary filmmaker, of course,
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.500]   I'm joking, half joking.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.180]   I don't know which percent is joking, but some truth.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:15.560]   But documentary filmmaker is a kind of storyteller,
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.880]   an artist, and somehow that's more trustworthy
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.560]   because you're on the same side in some way.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.400]   I don't know. - Maybe.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.240]   - Maybe. - Maybe on the same side.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.380]   - Maybe.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.540]   Is there something to be said
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.260]   in how you gain the trust of people to gain access?
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.820]   Are you just trying to be a good human being?
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:35.580]   Is there something to be said there?
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.380]   - Well, so I do draw a distinction
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:40.120]   between journalism and filmmaking
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.280]   because I think you're right.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.520]   They're different.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.600]   And there are some filmmakers who do hew
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.880]   to sort of the journalistic tenets
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.600]   of who, what, where, when, why,
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.400]   fair and balanced on both sides, right?
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.760]   Make sure everyone has a voice.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:53.600]   I don't.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.100]   - If you say fair and balanced,
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.320]   you're rarely either fair or balanced.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.680]   I've seen that with journalists.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.800]   Journalists often, unfortunately, in my perspective,
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.520]   sorry to interrupt you rudely and go on a rant,
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.640]   but they seem to-- - Go on a rant, do it.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.780]   - They seem to have an agenda
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.160]   as opposed to seeking to truly tell a story
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.520]   or to truly understand,
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.040]   especially when they're talking to people
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:24.240]   who have some degree of evil in them.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.760]   - Well, we all have an agenda, right?
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.040]   I think in anything we do,
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.480]   whether it's like to seek truth
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.720]   or some larger principle.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.720]   - Sure.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.000]   - I always have an agenda.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.860]   I chose to work with civilians and caretakers in Yemen
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:44.680]   on Hunger Ward rather than to go interview MBS, right?
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.940]   That's what I'm interested in
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:49.280]   is bringing that to the world, right?
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:55.580]   But in terms of building relationships and trust,
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.140]   it's really, I think, about transparency
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.740]   as much as anything else
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:03.380]   and going in in a collaborative sense.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:08.380]   So I don't think of the people
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:12.600]   that I film with as subjects, for example.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.360]   I think of them as collaborators.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.720]   So it's a different mindset that I go into projects with.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.560]   - That's beautiful.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.880]   - And it's based on relationships, right?
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.280]   You have to build relationships with other human beings
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.920]   however you can, and that takes time,
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.680]   and it takes listening, and it's active.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:32.960]   So I've talked about the notion of consent before,
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.680]   which is so important in nonfiction film.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.420]   And I hew to this idea that
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:45.160]   you don't just slide a piece of paper in front of someone,
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.240]   a release form, and have them sign it, right?
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.560]   And then you're done.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.460]   That's not the nature of true consent, in my mind.
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:56.800]   You have to work on a foundation of active consent
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.360]   every single day that you're working with someone.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.280]   And that's based on relationship, right?
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.560]   And it's based on dialogue.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.880]   So it's trust that I'm always aiming for.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.840]   It's the building of relationships
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.680]   which I'm always aiming for,
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:13.240]   which is why yesterday I got a bunch of photos
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.400]   from Dr. Al-Sadiq in the south of Yemen,
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.440]   and she sends me photos all the time
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.000]   of the children that she's currently treating
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.800]   because we have an active relationship
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.240]   that continues on and probably will for many years to come.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.280]   So it's going to continue, and that's the only way
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.060]   that I can do these kinds of films.
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:36.720]   - Let me ask you about silly little details of filming
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.400]   before we go to the big picture stories.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.040]   Cameras, lenses, how much do those matter?
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.880]   You mentioned director of photography.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:52.880]   What's your, how much do you love the feel,
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.960]   the smell of equipment that does the visual filming?
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.160]   You know, there's some people, they're just like,
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.340]   (sighs)
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:03.100]   they love lenses.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.740]   How much do you love that,
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.260]   or versus how much do you focus on the story
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.020]   or the access and all those kinds of things?
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.340]   - I'm not a tech geek,
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:15.360]   but because during the bulk of my career,
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.100]   I've worked as a director of photography myself
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:22.380]   for other people in order to pay the bills over the years.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:25.660]   You know, I know the technical side of it
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:27.300]   because I've had to know it,
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.640]   and I've had to train myself and learn it.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.720]   So I see them as necessary tools.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:38.720]   And again, because I believe film and cinema
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:45.320]   is and should be visually driven and not verbally driven,
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:49.480]   I want the best tools possible within my means, right?
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.880]   And within the logistical ability of the project
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.200]   because we have to go so small, right?
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.860]   I can't afford, nor can I bring a huge $100,000 lens.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:02.820]   - So if I give you a trillion dollars.
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:03.780]   - A trillion dollars?
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:04.620]   - Yeah.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.440]   - Wow.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.280]   - Unlimited.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.120]   - Yeah.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.060]   - There's still huge constraints
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.140]   that have nothing to do with money, like you just said.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.820]   So what cameras would you use?
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:16.060]   - You know what I'd do with a trillion dollars?
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:16.900]   I could do a lot with a trillion dollars.
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:17.720]   - You're not allowed.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.460]   You're only allowed to fund the film
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:23.620]   and no corrupt stuff where you use the film
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.900]   to actually help children.
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.420]   - No, you're not allowed to do any of that.
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.540]   - What I would do with a trillion is I wouldn't invest in,
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.860]   well, I guess I would invest in,
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:33.320]   I would increase capacity to do more films.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.160]   - I see.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:34.980]   - What I would do.
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:37.740]   So I would buy basically the perfect little,
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.760]   you know, mini equipment set, right?
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.980]   But then I would train three teams maybe
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:45.960]   to do the same thing that I've been doing
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.340]   so we could multiply and scale up.
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:49.300]   - Collect more and more stories.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.060]   - Yeah, that's what I would do with the money.
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.500]   - But the actual setup.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.140]   - Would remain small and nimble, yeah.
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:59.820]   - And what about lighting?
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.780]   Do you usually use natural light?
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:04.620]   Do you ever do, I mean,
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:06.300]   sorry for the technical questions here,
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:11.300]   but highlighting the drama of the human face.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.620]   - Yeah.
[01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:15.580]   - That's the visual, that's art.
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:18.820]   That's like to reveal reality.
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:19.660]   - Yeah.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:23.060]   - At its deepest is art.
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:24.780]   And do you use lighting?
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.100]   Lighting is such a big part of that.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.460]   Do you ever do artificial lighting?
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:30.100]   Do you try to do natural always?
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.260]   - You know the best lighting instrument in the world?
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.740]   - Is the sun.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.020]   - At the right moment of the day.
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.740]   And so I predominantly use natural light
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:48.140]   at certain moments and just shape natural light
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.780]   during the course of these small human right stocks.
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:54.740]   That's not to say we don't bring instruments sometimes,
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:59.740]   but when we do, they're very small and again, compact.
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:05.060]   So for example, I have this small little tube kit.
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.060]   That's just three instruments, right?
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.420]   That you can charge with USB.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:11.940]   'Cause electricity is often a major issue where we go.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:13.540]   So there's just three little tube lights
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:16.860]   with magnetic backs that if we find in a situation
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:19.300]   where we can't get enough exposure
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.940]   for a hallway or something,
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.780]   and we have the time to throw it up,
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:24.260]   we'll throw it up if people are walking,
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:27.140]   if collaborators are walking down that hallway a lot,
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.980]   for example, at night, just so we can see them, right?
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:31.500]   So it's instances like that.
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:35.580]   Or if we do do an interview, which we don't do very often,
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:40.580]   but if we do, just so we have a key light on the face, right?
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.380]   And always bring a reflector or two,
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:46.820]   just to shape natural light as well in ways.
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:51.820]   But it's about shaping rather than producing light for us.
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.900]   - Got it.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:55.860]   As we sit surrounded by black curtains
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.620]   in complete natural light.
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:02.620]   So just so you know, this room is like a violation
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:08.460]   of the basic principles of using the sun.
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:13.100]   So behind the large curtains are giant windows.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:13.940]   - Yeah.
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:14.940]   - So this whole--
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:15.780]   - Should I rip them open?
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:16.620]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:17.460]   - Rip open the curtains real quick.
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.060]   (laughing)
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.380]   - How much of the work is done in the edit?
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:24.180]   That's another question I'm curious about.
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:28.860]   And how much do you sort of anticipate that?
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:30.700]   Like when you're actually shooting,
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:36.700]   are you thinking of the final story as it appears on screen?
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:40.780]   Or are you just collecting as a human,
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.940]   collecting little bits of story here and there,
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:46.540]   and the edit is where most of the storytelling happens?
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:50.100]   - I've developed this sort of mental paradigm for myself
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:53.940]   over the years that speaks to that.
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:56.740]   And I call it the three creations, right?
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.300]   And so when I'm doing a film,
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:04.300]   the first creation for me is my preconception
[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:08.020]   or visualization of what the film is going to be
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.420]   before I shoot it, right?
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:14.420]   So I have this entire vision of what a film's gonna be.
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.900]   And sometimes it can be pretty specific,
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.620]   like I'll think through the scenes,
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.700]   if I know the locations and everything,
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:24.420]   and I'll have this idea of what I'm gonna create, right?
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.740]   And then I'm there filming, right?
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:29.780]   And always, without fail,
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:32.540]   reality is something altogether different
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:33.860]   than what I thought it would be.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.460]   - But it's still good to have the original idea.
[01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.180]   - Yeah, yeah, but if I tried to hold
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.820]   to that original vision, right?
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.380]   And to create a film out of that idea,
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.420]   they'd be crap, all the films would be crap.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:46.140]   So I have to adapt, I have to evolve my approach,
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:49.860]   and then embrace what is actually occurring
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.420]   with the people who are actually doing it,
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.060]   and then re-envision.
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.180]   So that re-envision is very active
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.100]   during the entire filming process.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:58.940]   And so that's the second creation.
[01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:02.860]   That's the rethinking and re-visualizing
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.700]   based on what we're actually experiencing and seeing,
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.980]   what this film is going to be.
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.380]   And then I finish filming, right?
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:13.060]   And we bring the hard drives back,
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:16.620]   and we plug in the hard drives in the Etabay.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:20.420]   And oftentimes, because it's two of us filming
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:23.700]   most of the time, I haven't seen all the footage.
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:26.900]   'Cause in the field, it's all about just filming, right?
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:28.740]   And then just transferring the footage
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.380]   and getting it on safely, you know,
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.860]   cloned to multiple drives.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.580]   I don't have a chance to review everything.
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:36.380]   I can't do rushes like you do on a large feature.
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.460]   So because I'm filming half of it,
[01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:40.780]   I know what I've filmed, right?
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:42.180]   But I haven't seen everything
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:45.060]   the director of photography has filmed, right?
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.940]   So the next stage for me is reviewing
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:52.020]   every single frame of what's been filmed.
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:56.140]   And that's where discovery happens the third time, right?
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:58.620]   Or second time rather, is, wow,
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.660]   now I thought we'd filmed this,
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:05.180]   but actually there's this over here.
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:07.460]   And then I have to open up this second vision
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:10.940]   and turn and transform it into a third vision for the film
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.980]   based on what's actually on the hard drive.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.700]   - So is this like a daily process?
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:19.340]   - So what I do, my process is that once,
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.020]   if it's a really difficult project,
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.380]   I'll take a break before I go through this.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.140]   Just for healing, you know,
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.340]   and some space away and fresh eyes.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:29.060]   And usually that's about a month.
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:32.460]   And then once I re-engage, I re-engage whole hog.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:37.100]   I re-engage fully and I review every single frame.
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.540]   And as I do that, I create a spreadsheet.
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:43.220]   And for "Hunger War," that spreadsheet was,
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.860]   I don't know, 1,500 lines long or something,
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:48.060]   where it's basically log notes.
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:51.300]   And I watch every scene and I take notes
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:54.180]   and I know really what we have.
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:55.860]   And once I've gone through that process
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.300]   that takes about a month
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.820]   and I really know what we came back with,
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.740]   I create an outline for the film from that.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.740]   And that's the third visioning, right?
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:07.540]   That's usually completely different
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:10.740]   than my original vision for the film, to some extent, right?
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:14.260]   But I have to stay open to that entire process
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:17.020]   or I'd be trying to create something
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.580]   that I can't really create.
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:22.620]   So I think those are the three creations for me.
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.780]   - That's so cool to know what we have,
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:31.940]   just to lay it all out and to load it into your mind.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:35.780]   'Cause this is the capture of reality we have.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:37.780]   It's a very kind of scientific process too,
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:40.460]   'cause in science, you collect a bunch of data
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:43.660]   about a phenomena and now you have to analyze that data.
[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:46.020]   But now your phenomena's long gone.
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:46.940]   - Yeah, yeah, right, right.
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:47.780]   Now you just have the data.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:51.380]   - Just the data and you have to write a paper about it,
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:52.220]   analyze the data.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.980]   It's similar things.
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:55.380]   You have to load it all in.
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:56.860]   Where's the story?
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:23:01.860]   How do you, that last probably profound piece
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:07.140]   of doing the editing in your mind,
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:10.180]   how to lay those things out?
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:12.180]   - Well, it's almost like the scientific process.
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:15.300]   I have a hypothesis, a creative hypothesis, right?
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:16.980]   Not a scientific one.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:19.020]   But then I'm testing the hypothesis
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:20.900]   during the course of filming, right?
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:24.220]   And I have to stay true to what the data tells me
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.700]   in the end, creatively.
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.500]   So it's very similar to the scientific process.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.140]   I don't know what we should, we should probably coin that.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:30.980]   - Yeah, that's pretty good.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:34.620]   - Creative scientific process or something like that.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:38.220]   - But then you actually do the edit and then you watch.
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:41.260]   That's also iterative in a sense,
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:46.260]   'cause maybe when you have a film that's 20, 30, 40 minutes,
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:52.220]   or if it's feature length, do you ever have it
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.580]   where it sucks?
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:55.420]   Like it's not at all--
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:56.700]   - Or a stage where it sucks?
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:58.740]   - Like a stage where, right, right.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:01.380]   Like it's where it's like, no, this is not,
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:02.780]   this is not what I was,
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.620]   like when it's all put together in this way,
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:07.020]   this doesn't, this is not working right.
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:08.780]   This is not right.
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:12.100]   Or do you, is it always like an incremental step
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:12.940]   towards better and better and better?
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:13.940]   - It's incremental.
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:14.940]   Yeah, it's incremental.
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.860]   Yeah, and there's always some moment
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.980]   in the editing process where there's a breakthrough,
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:24.380]   where suddenly I understand how it fits together more fully.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.100]   - And you have to be, like you said, resilient.
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:28.540]   You have to be patient that that moment will come.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:29.380]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.420]   - Are you ultra self-critical
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:35.380]   or are you generally optimistic and patient?
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.500]   - I don't think those are mutually exclusive.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:40.260]   - Right, so you just oscillate.
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:42.460]   Or are there like dance partners or something?
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:43.900]   - There are dance partners, yeah.
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:45.020]   Yeah, definitely dance, you know,
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.420]   all the way through the process.
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:51.460]   - By way of advice, you know, to young filmmakers,
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:57.700]   how to film something that is recognized
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:00.620]   by the world in some way.
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:05.380]   - I would say, you know, first off, learn your craft, right?
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:10.380]   Because I think craft is incredibly foundational, right?
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:14.460]   To creating a powerful story.
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:16.580]   - And sorry to interrupt, but when you say craft,
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:18.780]   do you mean just the raw technical,
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.820]   the director of photography, like the filming aspect?
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.540]   Is it the storytelling, is it the access, the whole thing?
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:25.980]   - I think craft is more than just knowing
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:28.780]   how to push record on a camera or what lens to use, right?
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:30.540]   That's part of it, right?
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:35.540]   But I think, at least in nonfiction, you know,
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.700]   I'm a product to some extent
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:42.620]   of having to know how to do it all, right?
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:44.780]   Having to teach myself how to do it all.
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:47.020]   'Cause I didn't go to film school, you know?
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:53.100]   But I became so enamored of telling stories through a camera.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:58.020]   - What was the leap, by the way, from theater to storyteller?
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.980]   - Oh, I just needed an extra class in grad school.
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:05.060]   I was in a MFA directing class, and I needed an extra class,
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:07.020]   and I just sort of like talked my way
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:11.820]   into a television directing class and fell in love with it.
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:14.260]   - And the actor became the director.
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:15.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:19.980]   Yeah, I mean, I wasn't an actor, but I had to act,
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:21.660]   and I had to know the craft of acting
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:23.500]   because I was in the theater, you know, to work with actors.
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:24.740]   - Did you love it, though?
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:27.020]   Did you love acting? - The theater?
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:28.220]   - Yeah, theater. - The theater?
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.860]   The first, yeah, as an undergraduate, yeah.
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:32.060]   But then I learned pretty quickly
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:36.420]   that I was pretty bad at it, or at least not very good,
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:39.300]   and that my skills lay elsewhere
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.500]   in more sort of behind the scenes and shaping a story.
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:45.580]   - When you started taking a class,
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:48.780]   but also telling stories as a director,
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:53.780]   did you quickly realize that you're pretty good at this,
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:55.100]   or was it a grind?
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.660]   - That's a good question, Max.
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:02.260]   I think I definitely knew right away
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:05.460]   that it was more my wheelhouse, right?
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:10.420]   And I think part of that was because I grew up
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:13.180]   in sort of a world of imagination,
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:18.020]   and I think that act of imagination as a child
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:21.100]   really lent itself well to the skillset
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:23.940]   that a director needs, right?
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:26.780]   To shape story, to shape narrative, to shape performances.
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:29.660]   So I think it was a much more natural fit for me.
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.860]   Was I excellent at the beginning?
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:33.260]   Heck no, no.
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:36.020]   You know, I think few people are, but I learned.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:37.940]   - Where was the biggest struggle for you?
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:41.620]   Is it, so your imagination clearly was something
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:43.620]   that you worked on for a lifetime.
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:46.500]   So I'm sure that was pretty strong.
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:47.900]   - Books, came from books.
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:49.340]   - Books.
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.020]   But the actual conversion of the imagination,
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:53.980]   you said shape the story.
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:56.860]   Where was the skill most lacking
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:59.140]   in the shaping of the story initially?
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:27:59.980]   - Technical side.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:00.820]   - Just technical.
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:03.860]   - Yeah, like, you know, 'cause I taught myself everything.
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:05.660]   What kind of microphone should I use, right?
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:06.500]   What kind of camera?
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:07.580]   What does this lens do?
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:08.740]   What's that lens do?
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.140]   I didn't know any of that.
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:11.500]   And so I essentially was,
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.260]   I have been self-taught technically.
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:15.620]   - How do you get good technically,
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:16.900]   would you say, when you're self-taught?
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:18.300]   - Just doing it over and over again.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:20.140]   - And what kind of stories were you telling?
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:20.980]   Like--
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:24.300]   - I began shooting local commercials for--
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.140]   - For money.
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:25.980]   - For money, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.860]   - So you're doing professional projects.
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:28.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:31.260]   And so I kind of learned on the job as I did it.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.860]   - How many hobby projects did you do?
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:34.100]   Just for the hell of it?
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.900]   Or were you trying to focus on the professional?
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:37.300]   - I was trying to make money, right?
[01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.380]   Right out of grad school, just to pay the rent.
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:42.420]   - And that's a forcing function to,
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:45.660]   I mean, I personally love having my back to the wall,
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:48.900]   or financially, you're screwed if you don't succeed.
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:50.460]   So that's nice.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:51.940]   - I mean, I lived out of the trunk of my car
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:54.900]   for a couple of years after grad school, just freelancing.
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:55.740]   You know?
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:29:00.340]   Just like, but that couple years really helped me learn fast
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:02.460]   'cause I had to learn fast, you know?
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:05.900]   So I did a couple voyages around the world
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:08.180]   for this group called Semester at Sea.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.580]   That is a floating university
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:11.900]   that where they go out three and a half months at a time
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:15.100]   with about 500 college level students
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.540]   and about 35 professors.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:19.500]   And so you're shooting every day for three and a half months
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.820]   in like nine different countries.
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:25.260]   And so that really was like instrumental to me
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.740]   becoming a pretty good camera person pretty quickly.
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:29.300]   - And you were doing most of the work yourself?
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.260]   - One man, one man band, yeah.
[01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:35.500]   The second voyage, I at least had an editor with me.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:36.980]   Yeah, but I was shooting everything.
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:37.820]   - Yeah.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:38.820]   What's the perfect team?
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:43.820]   Is it two people for nonfiction asking for a friend?
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:45.860]   I'm kind of interested in some storytelling,
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:50.060]   not of the level and the sophistication that you're doing,
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.020]   but more.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:53.020]   - I think you have to allow the story to dictate
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:54.280]   what the size of the film should be.
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.980]   For these small human rights docs I do,
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.860]   I think two or three, you know,
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:29:59.580]   it means you work your butt off, right?
[01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.380]   'Cause you're doing everything, right?
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:03.660]   But it allows you to tell intimate stories
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:04.540]   and have that access.
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:08.540]   I'm doing a film this summer that's a scripted piece
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:10.500]   where we'll probably have 25 crew people.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.340]   - Oh, wow.
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:13.660]   - You know, so it's a completely different endeavor
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:14.540]   altogether.
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:18.580]   - But doing it yourself, what do you think about that?
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:21.340]   Even though you have that trillion dollars.
[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:23.020]   - Oh, I have that trillion dollars again?
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:25.140]   Sweet, you can write that check before I leave, right?
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:25.980]   - Yeah, I will.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:26.820]   - Great.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:28.660]   (both laughing)
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:30.260]   I've never seen a check for that big.
[01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:31.100]   That's really interesting.
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:31.940]   How many zeros is that?
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:32.940]   - I write them so often.
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.740]   (Lex laughing)
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:36.180]   I've lost track.
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.300]   Or the United States government sure as heck
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:39.380]   writes them often.
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:42.260]   Okay, anyway, I mean, like, is there an argument?
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:44.540]   Can you steal man the case for a single person?
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:46.420]   - You know, not for me.
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:49.340]   Not for me, and here's why.
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:58.680]   What I've found is that by being a team of two filming
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:03.820]   with a field producer, by two people filming,
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:10.460]   it allows us to double our footage first off, right?
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:13.680]   So we have twice as much footage in the time we're filming
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.900]   to come back with as opposed to one person filming.
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.420]   - So you're each manning a camera?
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:19.860]   - Yeah, constantly.
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:22.820]   - And how much, sorry to keep interrupting,
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.300]   but how much interaction and interplay there is?
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:28.180]   - Sometimes the director of photography is in another room
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:30.060]   filming a different scene if it makes sense.
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:32.780]   Sometimes we're cross shooting in the same room, right?
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:35.460]   It just depends on the needs of the moment.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:38.060]   So we come back with double the footage is one thing.
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.380]   But as a director, so that's, you know,
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:45.240]   and given how access is sometimes shaped by the events
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.800]   so that we can only, something, you know,
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.680]   in "Lifeboat" for example, you know,
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:52.860]   a rescue operation may only happen three days, right?
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:55.000]   So you want as much footage of that as you can.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.340]   But the other piece of it that's really critical for me
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:00.340]   I found is that by having another human being
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.740]   I'm filming with who I'm co-shooting with,
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:05.040]   it frees me up as a director
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.580]   to not always have to be shooting either.
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:11.580]   I can do all the other work to build relationships, right?
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:14.060]   To have side conversations with people,
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:18.700]   to sort out the right way to tell a story, right?
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:19.900]   Or to transfer footage,
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:21.940]   knowing that the director of photography
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.380]   is still filming during all that.
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:26.460]   So it frees me up to think of as a director
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:29.980]   rather than just an image acquirer.
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:31.260]   - Yeah, 'cause there's also,
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:32.420]   I don't know how distracting is,
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:33.780]   you've obviously done it for years,
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:38.780]   but setting stuff up, it preoccupies your mind.
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:42.480]   Like pressing the record button
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:43.940]   and like framing stuff and all that,
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:46.420]   that still, that takes up some part of your mind
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:48.260]   where you can't think freely.
[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:49.500]   - That's my choice, right?
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.020]   That's how I work best.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:53.060]   That said, the caveat there would be
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:55.020]   that's not the only way to do it, obviously, right?
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:58.980]   Like one of my favorite documentaries of all time
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:02.900]   is a documentary called "A Woman Captured,"
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:05.980]   shot in Hungary by a single filmmaker
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:09.460]   with a single camera, with a single lens, right?
[01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:13.860]   And it's brilliant and powerful and moving
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:16.060]   and interventional.
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:17.900]   It's incredible filmmaking.
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:20.580]   And it was a single human being who created that film
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:23.460]   with a collaborator or a subject.
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:26.820]   So it can be done, it's just not how I work best.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:29.980]   - Yeah, how much personally with the other person,
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:34.180]   how important is the relationship with them
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:36.020]   outside of the filming?
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.780]   - With the director of photography?
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:39.500]   - The director of photography, say.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:44.500]   How much drinking, and if you don't drink,
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.060]   whatever the equivalent of that is,
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.580]   do you have to do together?
[01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:48.940]   How much soul searching?
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:52.460]   Or is it more like two surgeons getting together?
[01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:55.940]   Is it surgeons or is it a jazz band?
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.980]   - Well, it could be either, right?
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:59.220]   Hopefully not at the same time, though,
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.020]   because I don't think surgeons and jazz bands
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:02.580]   go well together, probably.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:05.780]   - They're both good with fingers, I suppose.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:08.260]   - Exactly, but I'd rather maybe not play in jazz
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:09.900]   while they operate on me.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:14.900]   But I think, for me, I think there are moments of both,
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:17.620]   but usually not at the same time, right?
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:20.860]   There are surgical moments where the moment is so pressing,
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:25.020]   you really have to be that task-driven, right?
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:27.140]   To capture as thoroughly as possible
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:29.340]   whatever's unfolding, right?
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:31.820]   But I think there's other times where you do improvise
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:32.900]   like jazz, right?
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.980]   And where you have a lot of choices ahead of you,
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.820]   and you're doing maybe a dance
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:41.100]   with the other camera person, right?
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:43.220]   In order to capture a scene as creatively
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:47.460]   and fully as possible during a fixed duration.
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:51.380]   - How much, you said shaping, 'cause it is nonfiction,
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:53.420]   but I feel like there's so many ways
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.460]   to tell the same nonfiction,
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:57.860]   that it's bordering on fiction.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:58.700]   - Yeah.
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.140]   - It's, well, it's storytelling.
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:08.100]   And how much shaping do you see yourself as doing?
[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:11.780]   Like, how important is your role in how you tell the story?
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:16.500]   I suppose the question I'm asking is,
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.700]   how many ways can you really screw this up?
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:22.060]   - Every day you can screw it up.
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:24.820]   I mean, that's really the,
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:25.980]   well, I think what you're asking about
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.540]   is really the ethos of documentary filmmaking, right?
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:32.580]   I allow a lot of things to guide my choices.
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:38.100]   One of them being, am I being fair, right?
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:39.740]   Not balanced, right?
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:43.460]   But am I being fair to what I'm witnessing?
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.420]   - Does the camera capturing in a fair way
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.580]   the truth of the reality?
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:49.420]   Some fundamental truth of it.
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:51.620]   - And it also speaks to consent, right?
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.940]   Am I being fair in a sense of consent?
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:56.420]   Do I have active consent in this moment, right?
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:58.580]   Regardless of whether I have a signed piece of paper.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:00.260]   I always find some way to document it,
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:02.380]   whether it's just direct address to camera
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:05.420]   or a translated release.
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.700]   - So there's, actually that's an interesting little,
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:10.580]   so they say something to the camera that they consent
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:12.020]   or they sign the thing.
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:14.020]   - Yeah, so for example,
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:18.260]   the large broadcast companies have this formalized process
[01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:21.020]   where they present a piece of paper, right?
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:21.860]   - Yes.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:25.140]   - And the subject reads it and they sign it
[01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:28.820]   and then you have permission and that's irrevocable, right?
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:30.780]   So it'll hold up in court.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:32.780]   That's not how I operate, right?
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:37.540]   And so it's just, for example,
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:39.660]   that doesn't work if someone's illiterate
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:41.940]   and can't read that piece of paper, right?
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:44.220]   What if they don't know how to sign their name, right?
[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:46.340]   So instead you have to have a conversation,
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:49.340]   ask questions, have them ask questions,
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:51.500]   come to a complete understanding
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.620]   before you even know whether they understand
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:54.860]   what you're asking, right?
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:57.140]   And then in that case, if someone's illiterate,
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:58.780]   then you have that conversation,
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:00.900]   you just sit down and it takes a long time sometimes,
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:01.740]   but you have to do it.
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:04.340]   And then if they still wanna participate
[01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:06.460]   and they give you their consent,
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:08.500]   they can't sign a piece of paper, right?
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:11.700]   So then you just do in their native language, right?
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:14.180]   Direct consent to camera in their language.
[01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:16.300]   - Interesting, but also you're speaking to the consent
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:19.660]   that's just a human placing trust in you.
[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:20.940]   - Yeah. - You make a connection
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:21.780]   like this. - That's the most
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:23.180]   important concern. - Right.
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:28.180]   I hate papers, I hate papers and lawyers
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:31.380]   because they, exactly for that reason.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:35.180]   Yeah, okay, great, but you should be focusing
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:38.700]   on the human connection that leads to the trust,
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:41.580]   to the like real consent and consent day to day,
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:43.740]   minute to minute, 'cause that can change.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:45.980]   - Absolutely, and it does change.
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:49.300]   - You mentioned a woman captured.
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:52.620]   What are the, this is, I'm sure you can't answer that,
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:54.060]   but I will force you.
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:58.300]   What are the top three documentaries of all time,
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:00.180]   short or feature length?
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:02.420]   - Oh boy. - This is not your opinion,
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:04.180]   this is objective truth.
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:09.260]   Maybe top one, what's the greatest?
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:14.260]   We got, let's see, March of the Penguins,
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:15.820]   that's probably number one for me.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:17.340]   - Really? - No, I'm just kidding.
[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:22.340]   I don't know, I do seem to, the metaphor of penguins
[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:28.140]   huddling together in hard, cold,
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:32.420]   like in the harsh conditions of nature,
[01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:34.900]   that's something that's kind of beautiful.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:37.100]   I don't love all nature documentaries,
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:40.340]   but like something about March of the Penguins,
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:42.420]   I think Morgan Freeman.
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:44.100]   - Yeah, he narrated it. - Narrates it.
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.380]   So maybe everything, just any documentary
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:49.140]   with Morgan Freeman, I'm a sucker for that.
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:54.140]   Werner Herzog, Life in the Taiga, The Simple People.
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:56.060]   - I love Grizzly Man. - Grizzly Man.
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.980]   - I love Grizzly Man, I think that's one of his best works.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:03.140]   - Yes, I think that's Joe Rogan's favorite documentary.
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:06.820]   It's both comedy and, I mean, it's--
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:09.860]   - Tragicomedy. - Tragicomedy, yeah.
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:11.700]   Is there something that stands out to you?
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:13.860]   I mean, I'm joking about like best,
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:15.700]   something that was impactful to you?
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:18.700]   - Just to put it out there, I don't think there's any way
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:21.900]   to say that there are objectively the best three
[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:23.620]   documentaries of all time, but for me,
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:25.620]   and you may find this interesting given your background,
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:30.620]   is that I think my top three are all
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:35.500]   from the Eastern Bloc, actually.
[01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:40.500]   So Aquarela by Kosakowski, Viktor Kosakowski
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.780]   is one of my favorite, and it's a couple years old now,
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:47.420]   which is sort of a meditation on the place water has
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:49.060]   on our planet and in our lives.
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:53.340]   I think A Woman Captured that I mentioned,
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.540]   which was shot in Hungary.
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.260]   - Is it a feature-length one?
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:58.460]   - Both are feature-lengths, yeah.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:01.660]   It is just brilliant, and it, I think,
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:05.340]   has yet to find distribution here in the US, you know?
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.820]   But it's a perfect example of what they call,
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:12.820]   you know, vérité, or direct nonfiction filmmaking.
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:15.620]   - A European woman, this is the synopsis,
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.620]   a European woman has been kept by family
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:20.100]   as a domestic slave for 10 years,
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:23.540]   drawing courage from the filmmaker's presence.
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:27.260]   She decides to escape the unbearable oppression
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:28.580]   and become a free person.
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:32.500]   Wow, so the filmmaker is part of the story.
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:34.700]   - Part of the story, it didn't start that way,
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:36.300]   but during the course of the story,
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:39.500]   the filmmaker comes to understand
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.900]   that this is actually modern-day slavery.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:45.340]   And rather than just allow it to be,
[01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:48.380]   actually enables and assists this woman
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:50.980]   to free herself from slavery and become a free woman.
[01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:52.620]   - I wonder, sorry, on a small tangent,
[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:53.620]   before we get to number three,
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:55.700]   like Icarus is interesting too.
[01:40:55.700 --> 01:41:00.940]   How often do you become part of the story,
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:04.700]   or the story is different because of your presence?
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:10.060]   Like you changed the tide of history.
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:12.700]   - Yeah, well, back to just like one person at a time,
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:13.700]   that we keep talking, you know,
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:16.940]   we keep coming back to that theme on some level.
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:19.060]   So this could tie in interestingly
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:21.100]   into one of my favorite films, actually.
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:24.700]   So the last two films that I would mention
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:26.580]   from my top four list would be,
[01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:28.500]   the third Eastern Bloc one would be
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:31.860]   a film called "Immortal" in 2019,
[01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:34.420]   which was shot in Russia by a Russian woman
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:39.340]   that sort of examines the place of the state
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:45.900]   in shaping individuals to be vehicles for the state.
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:47.140]   I mean, that's my own synopsis,
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:49.020]   but that's one of my takeaways
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:52.100]   from the brilliant 60-minute doc or so.
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.260]   Again, Russian filmmaking, right?
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:57.940]   It's really quite good and powerful.
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:00.580]   The fourth one would be a Frederick Wiseman film,
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:02.740]   "Tidickett Follies,"
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:05.060]   which was filmed in the US decades ago
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:09.940]   inside basically the bowels of a insane asylum
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.980]   or a mental health institution.
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.340]   And I bring up Wiseman because, you know,
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:18.820]   he is really the godfather, so to speak,
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:22.660]   of direct cinema or cinema verite.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:25.980]   And early in my career,
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:30.300]   I really believed in what he expressed
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:33.540]   as the place of the verite filmmaker,
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:36.980]   which is simply fly on the wall,
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:41.700]   which is only observational in nature, right?
[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:44.860]   And I believe that that's how I should be
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:46.180]   as a nonfiction filmmaker,
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:49.380]   that I was there only to bear witness, to observe,
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:52.060]   and not to intervene in any way, shape, or form.
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:56.940]   And that was the sort of foundation
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:59.980]   for how I operated for many, many years.
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:01.820]   And then some things happened.
[01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:06.820]   So one of those things that happened was I filmed "Lifeboat."
[01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:10.940]   And during the course of filming "Lifeboat,"
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:14.380]   which covered rescue operations
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:16.580]   in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya,
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:21.620]   in the first three days of that rescue mission,
[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:26.260]   you know, we came upon over 3,000 people,
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:30.100]   asylum seekers, floating in flimsy rafts in the water.
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:35.700]   And we were on the Zodiacs, and we were filming.
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:39.500]   And within the first couple hours, you know,
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:44.500]   we would come up to these rafts and these boats
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:47.180]   that were in really dire shape,
[01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:48.980]   and people would be pushed off,
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:50.460]   and people would jump off,
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:52.700]   and people would fall into the water.
[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:56.940]   And some of them couldn't swim.
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:00.700]   And so we found ourselves in this moment
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:02.500]   where we had a choice.
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.700]   We could film someone drowned in front of us,
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:07.420]   or we could put our cameras down
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:09.220]   and pull them out of the water.
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:10.940]   And so that's what we did.
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:14.140]   We put our cameras in the bottom of the Zodiac
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.740]   and just started pulling people out of the water.
[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:21.060]   And, you know, if I was Wiseman, right,
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:23.460]   according to his paradigm,
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:25.340]   then we should have just filmed.
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:29.900]   And I didn't anticipate that moment beforehand.
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.780]   I had no sort of foreknowledge
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:33.660]   that I was gonna find myself faced
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:37.660]   with that dilemma of the moment as a documentarian.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:39.380]   But there was no question in my mind
[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:40.700]   that I had to put my camera down
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:43.180]   and pull that fellow human being out of the water.
[01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:44.820]   And I don't regret it at all.
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:46.260]   So I've come to a different place
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:48.500]   I've evolved to what I believe
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:51.700]   for the kind of film that I do is more appropriate, right?
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:56.100]   Like I can go to sleep at night knowing that,
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:57.820]   regardless of how the film would have been different
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:00.140]   if I hadn't made that choice,
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:02.180]   I made the right choice as a human being.
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:04.780]   So I think of it as being a human being first
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:07.740]   and a filmmaker second in moments like that.
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:09.340]   - That's beautifully, beautifully put.
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:12.700]   But I also think like you could be a human being
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:17.380]   in small ways too, like silly ways
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:20.940]   and put a little bit of yourself in documentaries.
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:23.080]   I tend to see that as really beautiful.
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.180]   - Like the meta piece of it?
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:31.020]   - Yeah, just put yourself into the movie a little bit
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:34.020]   because like break that third, fourth,
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:35.580]   whatever the wall is,
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:38.820]   is realize that there's a human behind the camera too.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:41.700]   For some reason, me as a fan, as a viewer,
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:42.940]   that's enjoyable too.
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:45.780]   I think there's a real authenticity there
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:49.220]   behind the story, especially with these hard stories
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:53.060]   that you're doing that there's a human being struggling too,
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:56.420]   like observing the suffering
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:46:02.460]   and having to bear the burden
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:05.180]   that this kind of suffering exists in the world
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:09.100]   and you're behind that camera living that struggle.
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:12.420]   And there's small ways to show yourself in that way.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:16.540]   - As you know, I don't do that in a big way.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:18.980]   But I actually, there are subtle moments
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:23.220]   where I allow that presence to live just for a second.
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:26.620]   Like I hate belly button docs, that's what I call them.
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:27.460]   I don't know what-- - What's a belly button doc?
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:30.460]   - A belly button doc is navel gazing, right?
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:33.900]   Where sort of a narcissistic filmmaking
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:38.900]   where someone just studies their own place in the world.
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:39.780]   - I see, yeah.
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:44.780]   - I think my, I'm more concerned
[01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:49.020]   with how I can intervene, right?
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:52.620]   - Yeah, well, you're trying to really deeply empathize.
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:53.460]   - Yeah.
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:55.980]   - So if you deeply empathize, who am I?
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:58.020]   - I don't wanna center myself in these stories.
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:46:59.420]   It's not about me, right?
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:01.140]   I am so unimportant.
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:03.700]   What is important is what's happening,
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:06.340]   what's unfolding in the world that we need to act upon.
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:09.220]   And I think it's selfish and narcissistic
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:13.420]   to push myself into these stories unnecessarily.
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:16.220]   Now that said, I think there is some small value
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:18.940]   in what you're saying just to remind viewers
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:21.060]   that there's obviously a filmmaker at play.
[01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:23.040]   So sometimes the way that I do that
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.740]   is just like through a question on camera.
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:28.700]   I'd allow the audio to live of a question
[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:31.180]   or during a conversation I'm having with someone
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:34.580]   so they can just hear how it's posed, for example.
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:36.180]   Right, and to me, that's enough.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:42.140]   - Yeah, I do like moments when people
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:43.660]   recognize that you exist.
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:47.260]   They look at the filmmaker past the camera
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.620]   and, yeah, so you ask the question in an interview
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:52.580]   or something like that, and they respond to that.
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:53.420]   - Yeah.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:57.180]   - Like they respond to this new perturbation
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.980]   into their reality that was created by this other human.
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:00.820]   - Yeah.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:02.860]   - And I especially like when those questions
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:07.660]   or those perturbations are a little bit absurd
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:11.300]   and add something very novel to their situation
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:14.240]   and that novelty reveals something about them.
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:18.300]   So as opposed to capturing the day-to-day reality
[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:21.660]   of their life, you do that plus the perturbations
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:23.060]   of something novel.
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:24.380]   - Yeah.
[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:26.860]   - But of course, there's all kinds of ways to do this.
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:29.700]   Let me, what was number five, by the way?
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.020]   - Only, I only gave you four.
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:31.860]   - You just--
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:33.540]   - I'm sorry, it's day four.
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.140]   There's a short doc I like, I mentioned,
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:38.540]   they're called The Toxic Pigs of Fukushima.
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:39.380]   I know, I know.
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:40.220]   - Sorry, I apologize.
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:41.060]   - I know, I know.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:42.260]   - It's dark.
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:43.100]   - It's a great title, though, right?
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:43.940]   - It's dark, it's a great title.
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:45.300]   - Yeah, great title.
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:47.820]   No one's seen it, but it's great.
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:49.420]   - It says what it sounds like.
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:51.420]   - Yeah, yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like,
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:53.780]   but really brilliantly executed.
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:56.460]   - Well, let me ask you about Lifeboat
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:49:01.460]   'cause it's extremely, I don't,
[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:06.980]   it's a really moving idea,
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:10.500]   just the fact that this exists in the world,
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:14.500]   that there's, as a metaphor, as a reality,
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:18.700]   that there is a set of people trying to flee desperately,
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:20.200]   is the desperation of it.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:25.020]   And now there's refugees, the desperation of that,
[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:28.340]   of trying to escape towards a world
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:32.460]   that's full of mystery, uncertainty, doubt,
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:34.220]   could be hopeless at times,
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:38.060]   and you're willing to do a lot for your own survival
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:39.740]   and for the survival of your family
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:40.740]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:42.820]   That's kind of the human spirit,
[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:47.420]   and you just capture it in Lifeboat.
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:51.020]   Can you tell me the story behind this film,
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:52.580]   as you started to already tell,
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:55.480]   can you tell me what is it about?
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:01.500]   - So Lifeboat really seeks to sort of lift up
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:08.500]   and showcase the asylum seeker crisis in the Mediterranean
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:15.100]   when it was at its height in 2016.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:19.060]   And it came to be for many reasons,
[01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:24.060]   but one of those reasons is colleagues in the NGO community
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:28.520]   really shared with me that when the borders
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:30.560]   between Greece and Turkey were shut down,
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:35.560]   that the flow of Syrian asylum seekers
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:39.720]   that was initially going across from Turkey to Greece
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.600]   was going to shift westward across the Mediterranean.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.920]   So I started to research that
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:46.720]   and discovered that was exactly the case.
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:49.520]   And then further stumbled upon the fact
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:54.440]   that nation states hadn't really stepped up to address it
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:57.520]   and that there were hundreds of asylum seekers
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.480]   often drowning in these flimsy crafts
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.880]   that were pushed off from the shores of Libya
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:06.160]   because the EU wasn't doing its duty
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:09.640]   to patrol those waters from a humanitarian standpoint.
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:13.240]   And so the net result of that was that this whole
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:16.520]   sort of like humanitarian community sprung up
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.920]   and it was civil society based
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:22.200]   that tried to meet the needs of those asylum seekers
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:26.800]   to just ensure that fellow human beings weren't drowning,
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:27.640]   simply put.
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:31.080]   And one of those was this small little NGO called Sea Watch,
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:33.400]   which when they discovered what was happening,
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:38.400]   just cobbled together a coalition of volunteers,
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:41.840]   bought a research vessel, retrofitted it,
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:44.480]   and motored down off the coast of Libya
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:46.080]   to start pulling people out of the water.
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:48.600]   And again, I found that inspiring.
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:52.400]   I found that inspiring that this group of volunteers
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:55.560]   was doing something that our leaders wouldn't.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:59.640]   And it was something as basic and simple
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:01.600]   as saving human beings.
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:06.320]   And I thought there was an inspiring story there.
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:08.480]   And as it turned out, there was.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:11.280]   - Have you ever saved someone's life
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:17.560]   as part of making these documentaries directly?
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:22.080]   And directly, I think you probably have countless lives,
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.280]   but directly.
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:25.000]   Were you put in that position?
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.840]   - I don't wanna.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:29.840]   I mean, I certainly poured people out of the water
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:30.720]   who couldn't swim.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.520]   I did that.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:35.680]   - And that's again, speaking to the basic humanity.
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.600]   Put down the camera, help.
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:43.520]   So this is people coming from Libya,
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:46.240]   trying to make it across the Mediterranean Sea.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:48.920]   On a crappy, tiny boat.
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:51.400]   From a filmmaker perspective, how do you film that?
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:55.880]   Was there decisions to capture the desperation?
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:00.880]   - Well, we were going back to this idea of access
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:03.360]   and how that's so fundamental to my approach.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:10.040]   We were bound by the strictures of the rescue operation
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:12.880]   on this Sea-Watch vessel, which was 30 meters long.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:16.720]   And we were two of a crew of 15.
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:18.680]   So we had to multitask all the time
[01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:21.680]   because the only reason we were on that boat
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:25.400]   was by agreeing that if needed,
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:29.840]   we would do whatever necessary to help.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:33.360]   And so it was very active on multiple levels.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:38.000]   And we were making decisions each and every day
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.160]   that were not only filmmaking and creative decisions,
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:47.160]   but also decisions about how to live that duality, right?
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:56.920]   Of being a humanitarian and a filmmaker simultaneously.
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:01.920]   And the greatest example I can share of that was,
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:04.440]   well, with my director of photography on that project,
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:05.360]   Kenny Allen.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.880]   Kenny's a big guy.
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:12.040]   He's got arms like tree trunks.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:18.240]   And because he was so physically able and strong,
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:23.240]   the head of mission really tasked him to be on the Zodiacs
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:24.800]   to pull people out of the water.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:27.040]   'Cause he could literally with one arm reach down
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:30.400]   and just oftentimes pull someone out, right?
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.840]   Whereas usually it would take two or three people for it.
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:37.000]   And so when we were at the height of triage
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.320]   and there were people in the water all over
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:41.720]   and rafts were sinking,
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:43.680]   Kenny was out pulling people out of the water.
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:46.320]   And this went on for like 24 hours, right?
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.320]   And at the end of that first day,
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:51.200]   I remember like looking over on the deck
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:54.320]   and seeing Kenny like help people up from the ladders
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.200]   to walk them back, right?
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:58.880]   And his camera was nowhere to be seen.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:01.240]   And so I walked over to him
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:03.680]   and I just grabbed him by the shoulders and said,
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:06.080]   "Kenny, where's your camera?"
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:08.840]   And he didn't know.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:11.160]   He had no idea where his camera was, right?
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.240]   And so I just said, "Kenny,
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:17.480]   "we're here to do what you're doing,
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:21.920]   "but we're also here to film it, right?
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:24.200]   "To make sure that we document
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:26.080]   "what is unfolding in front of us
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.120]   "so that we have a record of it, right?
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:30.720]   "So we can bring it to a larger audience.
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:32.400]   "So you need to go find your camera
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.920]   "so we can also document it."
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:36.520]   And that kind of pulled him out
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:38.440]   and he went and got his camera and started filming again.
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:40.960]   But that gives you a sense of sort of this world
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:43.960]   that we had to live in in order to get the story done.
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:47.320]   - But I think to be a great director of photography,
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:48.960]   to be a great director,
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:53.880]   you have to lose yourself like that in the story too.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.920]   - But usually with a camera in your hand, right?
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:58.120]   - But sometimes you forget the camera.
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:00.600]   I mean, there's a,
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.680]   I feel like if you're obsessed with the camera
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.040]   too much, you can lose the humanity of it.
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:10.200]   You get obsessed with the film and the story.
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:11.440]   - It can become clinical.
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:12.280]   - Yes, it can become clinical.
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.120]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:15.640]   And it's, you know, yeah, absolutely.
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:17.000]   And we don't wanna become,
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.360]   I don't wanna become clinical in my film, certainly.
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:23.440]   - Let me ask you a strange and perhaps edgy question.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:26.120]   So some filmmakers believe it's justified
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:30.760]   to break the rules in order to tell a powerful story.
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:35.760]   Werner Herzog, I read this somewhere,
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:37.880]   teaches young filmmakers to pick locks
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:39.560]   and forge documents and so on.
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.360]   - Oh, I didn't know that, interesting.
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:42.480]   - What do you think about that?
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:45.060]   Bending the rules in service of telling a story.
[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:48.200]   You would, of course, never break the law,
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:52.640]   but is there, does that,
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:55.920]   just generally speaking,
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:58.400]   bending the rules and so on,
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:02.200]   just to elaborate on this question, perhaps,
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:04.840]   I'm distinctly aware that there's parts in the world
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:08.440]   where the rule of law is not,
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:14.560]   like, enforced as cleanly as it is in the United States,
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:17.400]   as fairly as it is in the United States,
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:20.920]   that there's a kind of, there's a lot of bribery,
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:24.520]   there's a lot of, like, you don't really know to trust,
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:27.600]   you don't know if you can trust the cops
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:30.320]   or basically anybody,
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:34.680]   so, like, the rules are a very hazy kind of concept,
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.520]   and a lot of them, especially, like, it's funny,
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:38.160]   but authoritarian regimes often have
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:40.840]   a giant bureaucracy buildup that's full of rules.
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:43.000]   There's more rules than you know what to deal with,
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.480]   and you can't actually live life
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:45.960]   unless you break the rules.
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:49.160]   Anyway, laying that all out on the table,
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:51.640]   do you ever contend with that
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000]   on what are the rules I can break or should break
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.880]   to keep to the spirit of the story?
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:01.720]   - I think you have to ask yourself,
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:05.080]   are the rules just, and why are they in place, right?
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:07.360]   So, for example, coming into the airport
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:09.180]   in southern Yemen, right?
[01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:11.880]   If I just tried to walk through the airport
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:13.040]   with all my equipment,
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:16.000]   even with all the permissions beforehand, like we had,
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.840]   without having a fixer at the airport beforehand
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:23.180]   to make sure we didn't go through the standard line, right?
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:28.260]   We would have been caught up for three hours at least
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:30.040]   negotiating over our equipment
[01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:33.480]   and eventually paying a bribe to get it through, right?
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:36.640]   That's just reality in a place like Yemen.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:39.680]   And so, of course, knowing that, right,
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:40.800]   having talked to colleagues
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:43.360]   who had taken that path previously,
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.160]   I took a different path, right?
[01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:47.380]   Well, we hire a fixer beforehand
[01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:50.080]   to sort it out beforehand, right?
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:52.260]   Rather than spending three hours of our time
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:54.240]   and paying a series of bribes, right?
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:57.000]   Instead, we're going to get it fixed beforehand
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.200]   so that we can walk through a different line
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:02.160]   and have no one look at any of our equipment.
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:06.400]   That's a pretty good trade-off in my mind.
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:09.280]   - What about security when you're traveling in these places?
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.800]   Do you ever have bodyguards?
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:14.640]   Well, several questions around that.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:16.800]   Are you ever afraid for your life
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:18.680]   when you're filming in a war zone?
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:24.600]   Is there any way to lessen the probability of death?
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:28.400]   - I don't have a death wish.
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.000]   I try to mitigate risk however I can, however I can.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.120]   But one of the ways I can't do it in a conflict zone
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:37.480]   is by having armed security with me.
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:39.300]   And the reason for that is because,
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:41.760]   especially in a place like Yemen, right,
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:44.300]   if you have armed security, you become a target
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:47.180]   in a way that if you're operating under
[01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:52.060]   sort of the auspices of international humanitarian law,
[01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:53.600]   I actually have more protection.
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:55.460]   So I don't bring security.
[01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:58.740]   If you're working in Northern Yemen, for example,
[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:03.740]   you're going to have someone from the de facto authorities
[02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:06.780]   with you anyway the entire time you're there.
[02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:10.960]   So the authorities are with you in form anyway.
[02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:17.420]   Regarding fear, yeah, of course.
[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:21.900]   I mean, fear is a natural human emotion, right?
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:25.300]   And I think we have a weird mindset,
[02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:31.100]   this sort of heroic mindset surrounding fear in the US,
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:34.220]   which I don't pay tribute to.
[02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:38.900]   I believe as a natural human emotion,
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:41.740]   it's an alarm bell that I need to pay attention to, right?
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:46.740]   And I think rather than pretending to be brave, right,
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:52.620]   I think you have to just acknowledge that fear has a place
[02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:55.400]   to keep you alive.
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:01:00.400]   And I think it's a matter of not letting the fear arrest you
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:05.580]   and allowing the fear to live and then acting anyway.
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:08.400]   - Don't you think as a documentary filmmaker,
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:10.540]   the fear is a really good signal
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:12.860]   for potentially a good thing to do
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:14.940]   because there's a story there?
[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:17.380]   So is fear an indicator that you shouldn't do it
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:19.260]   or is it an indicator that you should do it?
[02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:23.020]   - It's probably an indication you should do it, right?
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:26.720]   And strangely, I think that's why,
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:30.500]   I think if there's something unusual
[02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:32.260]   about the work I do in some part,
[02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:35.180]   it's because of these types of stories, right?
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:36.760]   They're hard to access,
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:41.760]   but you also have to have a threshold of willingness
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:45.440]   to do them when you can't,
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:50.200]   there is no guarantee of physical safety, right?
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.880]   And maybe that's why you should do them.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:56.240]   - I'm very much motivated by the things that scare me.
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:00.280]   They seem to direct the things that are worth doing
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.960]   in this all too short life.
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:05.100]   How often do you interact with our friendly friends
[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:07.600]   at the police departments of various locations?
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:08.480]   (Lex laughing)
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.880]   Like because of the humanitarian nature of your work,
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:17.000]   are you able to avoid all such friendly conversations
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.600]   or are you often making friends with her?
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:25.200]   - I try to avoid the friendly police people
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:27.160]   all over the world as much as possible.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:33.200]   But in some instances, it's important to be proactive,
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:36.340]   right, and make sure that they know what you're doing
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:37.500]   before you do it.
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:40.620]   So it's all about the context and the situation.
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:43.540]   For example, working in Northern Yemen,
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:45.540]   you couldn't film for five minutes
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:47.180]   if you didn't have paperwork,
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:48.620]   'cause you'd be taken away.
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:50.680]   So you have to make sure you have all those permissions
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:51.520]   ahead of time.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.060]   - 50 Feet From Syria,
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:03:00.700]   I would love to talk at least a little bit about this film.
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:03.560]   First, can you high level,
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:05.480]   can you tell what this documentary is about?
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:09.240]   - Yeah, it was early in the Syrian uprising.
[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:15.800]   We returned to the Syrian-Turkish border
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:18.880]   with a Syrian-American orthopedic surgeon
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:21.520]   who was volunteering, operating on refugees
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:24.520]   as they flowed across the border from Syria to Turkey.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:27.740]   And it was an attempt at the time,
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:30.680]   before a lot of films had come out about the conflict,
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:34.520]   to really show again,
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:38.760]   the effects of the war on civilians.
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.920]   You've heard me echo that sentiment multiple times now,
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:46.920]   but people knew there was a major conflict in Syria,
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:50.160]   but didn't really understand the form that that was taking
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:51.880]   and the impact it was having.
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:55.520]   And so we embedded into,
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:58.760]   at the time it was the only clinic in Turkey
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:02.160]   that was sanctioned by the Turkish government
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:05.040]   to treat Syrian refugees.
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:08.320]   And so we filmed there with surgeons
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:11.160]   as they operated on war victims.
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:14.160]   And we also went into Syria, into some of the camps as well.
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:16.200]   - So in this film,
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:18.240]   there's a man who crosses the border every day
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:21.680]   to retrieve the wounded and fare them safety and care.
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:25.400]   And you also mentioned about heroism in the United States.
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:29.960]   Can you tell me about this man and just people like him?
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:31.760]   Like what's the heroic action
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:35.840]   in some of these places that you've visited?
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.560]   - So in that instance,
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:41.120]   I thought of him as the Turkish Schindler, right?
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:44.040]   Because he was human being who,
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:46.200]   of his own volition,
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:48.840]   no one was paying him to do this,
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:53.600]   but he was spending much of his time,
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:55.480]   he was just a local businessman
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:57.800]   who really saw the need in the camps
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.320]   right across the border, 10K away.
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:04.280]   And he saw the medical need in particular
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:07.400]   and how hard it was to get people
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:11.240]   in desperate medical conditions across the border
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:13.760]   where there was a clinic just right across the border,
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:17.960]   but because of the security and the layers of security,
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:20.080]   they couldn't get out by themselves.
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:24.080]   So he took it upon himself as a Turkish person
[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:26.960]   to build relationships with the Turkish guards,
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:28.960]   which was relatively easy.
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:31.360]   And then he built relationships
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:34.480]   with sort of the guards in the no man's land
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:36.240]   between the Syrian guards
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:38.480]   and sort of those who lived in the middle area.
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:41.280]   And then also with the Syrian guards at the camp.
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:44.360]   And he would drive out there daily and bring them food.
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:47.680]   Talk them up and build relationships.
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:49.960]   And so every day he would bring these guards food
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:51.560]   and build relationships with them.
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:54.440]   And what that meant was eventually, right?
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:58.920]   He had this avenue of access to and from the camps.
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:00.560]   And so he started using it.
[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:05.160]   And he would drive this avenue of access
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:08.080]   through the three layers of guards each day.
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:10.480]   And then they would open the gates for him
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:14.040]   because he had made himself trustworthy in their eyes.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:18.480]   And he would receive the most desperate medical cases
[02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:21.920]   that were coming from all over Northern Syria, right?
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:23.520]   To receive medical treatment.
[02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:25.440]   And he would, as you see in the film,
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:29.200]   he would ferry them into the back of his car, right?
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:31.720]   And then drive them to the hospital
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:33.560]   where they would receive operations.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:36.640]   And then he would bring them back if they wanted
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:39.480]   after they'd healed and recovered back to Syria,
[02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:41.920]   if they wanted to return out post-recovery.
[02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:44.080]   And he didn't get paid for that.
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:46.600]   He was spending his own money to do it
[02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:49.600]   because he saw other human beings in need.
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:52.840]   And it's like we were talking about earlier.
[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:54.640]   That's heroic, right?
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:55.960]   That's selfless.
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:59.960]   That's aspirational for me, right?
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:03.960]   Here's someone who is spending their time on the planet
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:06.760]   doing something of value and good to other human beings.
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:09.400]   - I mean, if you draw parallels to Schindler,
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:13.640]   I feel like the fascinating thing about Schindler
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:18.240]   is that he's kind of a flawed human
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:21.640]   and is not the kind of human that does these things usually.
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:23.480]   But he just can't help it.
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:25.040]   And that's like the basic humanity.
[02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:30.040]   Despite who you are, the basic humanity shines through.
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:33.040]   - I think that the whims of war
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:35.200]   test people in those ways, right?
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:39.600]   They ask of you things that you may not even know
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:41.200]   were going to be asked of you.
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:43.160]   And then it speaks to who you are
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:44.960]   fundamentally as a human being.
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:47.800]   - They reveal who you are as a human being,
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:48.840]   just as you said.
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:55.160]   Let me ask a kind of stupid technical question
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:58.160]   about publications of movies and so on.
[02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:02.320]   I've been recently becoming good friends with Thomas Tall,
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:04.200]   who was the producer.
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:06.320]   His company, Legendary, funded some of the big
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:08.520]   sort of blockbuster films and so on.
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:10.840]   And so obviously money is part of filmmaking.
[02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:11.680]   It's interesting.
[02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:13.840]   But also the release of movies.
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:18.840]   And me as a consumer, with Netflix, with YouTube,
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:23.720]   that's one of the reasons I'm a huge fan of YouTube
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:26.880]   is it's like out in the open.
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:30.360]   Access, especially historical access.
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:33.920]   Like over time, you can look back years later.
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:35.160]   If you pay some money,
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:38.360]   you can watch some of the great films ever made.
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:40.320]   YouTube, Hulu, Netflix.
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:41.920]   I don't know what other services there are.
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:44.120]   HBO, Paramount.
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:44.960]   - Paramount Plus.
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:46.040]   - Paramount Plus.
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:50.160]   Anyway, there's all these platforms.
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:52.800]   Spotify now.
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:59.040]   I understand they wanna create paywalls and so on.
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:00.600]   It makes sense.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:02.560]   But I'm a huge fan of openness
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:04.680]   and I'm really kind of torn by this whole thing.
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:07.360]   Anyway, that's a discussion for perhaps another time.
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:10.000]   But the short question is,
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.040]   why is it so hard to watch your documentaries
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:18.960]   and other films, other incredible films on the internet?
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:23.120]   If I want to pay unlimited amount of money,
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:26.440]   I wanna pay a lot of money to watch it.
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:27.960]   Why is it so hard?
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:30.800]   - Well, "Lifeboat" is streaming free on the New Yorker.
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:33.360]   - Yes, I saw that.
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.440]   But it's still, which is interesting.
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:37.360]   That doesn't make any sense.
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:41.680]   And then also "Hunger War" is on Paramount Plus,
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:43.120]   but also-- - Pluto TV.
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:45.680]   - It's also streaming free.
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:48.000]   - So you can either go through a paywall
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.240]   or you can watch it with ads with Big Macs interspersed.
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:53.080]   - Big Macs.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:53.920]   - Sometimes.
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:55.720]   - Yeah, the contrast.
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:57.040]   - It's tough.
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:00.440]   - Well, no, it really reveals the power of the documentary.
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:04.440]   No, but it's still not, even those platforms,
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:07.800]   I mean, they're not as easily accessible
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:10.560]   'cause you have to think.
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:13.320]   And you have to chase a particular--
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:15.200]   - You have to chase it, yeah, yeah.
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:17.040]   I guess from an economic standpoint,
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:19.440]   the answer to that is pretty clear, right?
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:21.680]   It may not be what people wanna watch.
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:25.560]   Maybe people wanna watch reality.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:30.560]   Maybe people wanna watch animal rescue shows,
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:32.280]   here in the US.
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:36.280]   Which is exactly why, in part,
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:39.280]   I think it's so vital that we continue to do
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:42.000]   stories on things that aren't about
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.280]   flowers and puppy dogs, right?
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:45.280]   - I would push back on that.
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:49.240]   So, there's TikTok.
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:51.960]   And you could say, well, look,
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:55.880]   humans just wanna watch really short content
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:58.280]   because they seem to be addicted to that kind of thing.
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:00.080]   That's partially true.
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:04.200]   But they also watch two, three, four, five-hour podcasts.
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:07.360]   - On TikTok?
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:09.680]   - No, there's different platforms for that.
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:11.040]   There's a place called YouTube,
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:12.040]   I'll teach you about it some time.
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:14.320]   - Okay, yeah, I've never heard of it.
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.960]   - It's a good place to publish documentaries, I think.
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:21.840]   Humans are interested in a lot of things.
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:24.960]   And I've seen, many times,
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:26.840]   a thing that you think is a niche thing
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:29.040]   become a very big thing.
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:30.960]   But for them to become mainstream,
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:33.040]   they have to have a platform that
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:35.080]   allows for the mainstream to happen.
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:35.920]   - The access.
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:39.920]   - The access, the dumb, simple, frictionless access.
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:43.560]   The frictionless access is a really important thing.
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:46.840]   Paywalls create friction.
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:48.540]   And not just because of the money.
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:52.120]   It can be free, but if you have to click on a thing,
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:55.640]   or maybe sign up, or put your email,
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:11:59.320]   it's just not, it creates a,
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:05.000]   it prevents you to enjoy the thing you would really enjoy,
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.680]   and you know you would enjoy,
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:10.800]   but your baser human nature prevents you from enjoying,
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:14.240]   'cause you can just open up TikTok and keep scrolling.
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:17.000]   So that's just something to say about platforms,
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:21.640]   because I think the things that need platforms the most
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:23.960]   are things like your films.
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:27.280]   The things that I think a lot of people would love watching.
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:30.480]   They're very important, and they can have viral impact
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:32.680]   on the world that is fundamentally positive.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:38.480]   It makes me sad that there's not a machine
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:41.920]   for celebrating those films.
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:44.180]   - There are lots of machines to celebrate them,
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:47.520]   but they're just not as always accessible as YouTube, right?
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:49.080]   I mean, as soon as you write me that check
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:51.360]   for a trillion dollars when I walk out of here,
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:53.360]   then I'm gonna put all my films on YouTube,
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:56.640]   'cause then I won't have to worry about selling them
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:58.040]   so I can make the next film,
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:00.920]   because film is not just an art.
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:03.000]   It's also an industry, right?
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.560]   And that tension between the two is a constant interplay
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:08.760]   that is a reality for me.
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:10.520]   So I always have to think about
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:14.840]   how can I access the largest audience,
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:19.340]   but also go out and shoot the next film, right?
[02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:22.360]   So that longevity question is also an issue,
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:26.840]   and the finances are part of that sort of equation
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:29.560]   that I constantly have to rewrite over and over again.
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:34.160]   - How often as a creative mind do you feel the constraints,
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:35.600]   the financial constraints?
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:41.180]   - I wish I could do a lot more films
[02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:44.840]   that I can't always because of financial constraints.
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:46.200]   - So it's the number of films.
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:47.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:51.560]   - And is a film that you do currently,
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.920]   is a film that you do at any one time
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:56.480]   as you're filming it already funded,
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:59.080]   or is it the funding from previous stuff
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:01.160]   that you're trying to use?
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:02.840]   - Before "Hunger Ward,"
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:08.240]   I would just take a flyer on my films, right?
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:12.880]   Where I would just say, "This meets the So What threshold.
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:14.940]   "This is a story that has to be told,
[02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:17.580]   "and I want to tell it."
[02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:19.640]   And then I could just go shoot it.
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:22.040]   And usually on credit, usually on a credit card.
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:26.120]   So based on a belief that,
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:27.520]   "Lifeboat" was done that way.
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:28.520]   - Yes.
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:29.840]   - "50 Feet from Syria" was done that way.
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:32.240]   - So you're on a boat, broke.
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:34.920]   - Yeah, yeah, but it's free food, right?
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:37.400]   And free lodging 'cause there's a bunk on the boat.
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:41.960]   But I do that not intending to stay broke, right?
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:44.600]   But based on a foundational belief that
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:50.480]   if I bring to bear all of my sort of
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:53.040]   quiver of creative arrows to it, right?
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:56.680]   That I can create something of value, right?
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:00.280]   In the world, but hopefully also financially,
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:02.000]   that then I can sell to someone.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.040]   And you know, every time I've done that, Lex,
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:07.000]   I've gotten into the black.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.920]   So it's a risk, and I have to have
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:12.420]   a certain risk threshold financially to do that,
[02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:14.440]   but I believe so deeply in these stories
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:15.680]   that I'm willing to do that.
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:17.160]   I didn't have to do that with "Hunger War."
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:20.020]   Luckily I had funders for that film.
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:24.400]   - Yeah, yeah, take risks in this life.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.700]   It's gonna pay off.
[02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:28.360]   Which reminds me of, let me ask you,
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:32.360]   I already asked you for advice for a filmmaker
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:34.280]   how to win an Oscar.
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:35.760]   - Well, I haven't won an Oscar.
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:38.160]   - How to get nominated for an Oscar, that's true.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:39.520]   (both laughing)
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:42.080]   Or just how to make great documentaries,
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:42.920]   how to make great film.
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:44.920]   But let me ask, even zoom out bigger,
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:48.240]   you mentioned some of these things,
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.440]   doing the things that you think matters.
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:52.960]   What advice would you give to young people,
[02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:54.560]   high school, college,
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:16:01.040]   dreaming of living a life worth living?
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:03.800]   What advice would you give them about career
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:06.000]   or maybe just life in general?
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000]   How to have a life they can be proud of?
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.240]   - Yeah, I don't know how you're gonna react to this
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:13.040]   given sort of your expertise,
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:17.320]   but I would say put down the smartphone,
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:19.480]   step away from the monitor,
[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:22.800]   because real life is not a screen.
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:27.040]   I believe that sort of the foundational skills
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:30.400]   which are conducive and important to success
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:34.800]   aren't necessarily those technical skills
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:39.440]   which we're going to learn in trade schools or university.
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:43.280]   I think they're more foundational than that.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:48.160]   They're learning how to interact and listen.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.000]   - With humans?
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.920]   - With humans, yeah, to really see and listen, right?
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:55.680]   - And observe.
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:57.720]   - And observe, right?
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:00.600]   And how to step out of your door
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:03.040]   and if the electricity goes out, right,
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:05.040]   and you're five miles away from your house,
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:07.320]   you don't need a smartphone to get home
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.200]   because you've set visual markers for yourself
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:12.480]   on how to get back to where you live, right?
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:15.040]   I think we're in danger right now
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:18.800]   of living in a world where
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:21.440]   if the satellites stop functioning, right,
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:23.480]   then a whole lot of people
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:27.760]   have become completely dysfunctional, right,
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:30.920]   'cause we're so reliant upon the screens in our lives.
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:33.200]   So I think there's a lot of foundational skills
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:34.800]   that have nothing to do with technology
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:36.200]   that we need to learn that,
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:38.000]   and everything rests upon those.
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.160]   So I would say learn those foundational,
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:43.360]   learn how to write well, read a lot, right?
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:45.640]   It's a different kind of knowledge and wisdom
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:47.400]   that comes out of that.
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:49.520]   - So reading is kind of the equivalent of listening
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:51.040]   and observing, and writing is
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:57.040]   kind of integration of all of that
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:58.480]   that you've observed and listened to
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:00.280]   and tried to express something with that.
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.600]   - So I think my training in the theater
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:06.720]   has served me so well in the documentary world, right?
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:08.960]   'Cause it's all about interaction
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:11.920]   and listening and talking and dialogue, right?
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:15.840]   And that's what I do in documentaries, right, is I listen.
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:19.120]   - Yeah, I, yeah, we mentioned fear.
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:22.640]   Being an introvert, I'm very afraid of people,
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:25.840]   but I'm drawn to them and fascinated by them
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:26.680]   because of that.
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:28.240]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Enjoy listening to them.
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:31.960]   - Totally. - And observing them.
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:34.280]   And you mentioned reading, you mentioned books
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:37.960]   as a catalyst, as a stimulator of your imagination.
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:42.360]   Is there books in your life, a couple, one, two, three,
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.240]   that kind of left an impact
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:51.240]   or a little bit of spark of inspiration early on in life
[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:54.400]   that stand out from your memory?
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:58.320]   - I was given "The Prophet" by Kahlil Gibran
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:01.840]   as a graduation present from my high school
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:04.920]   English teacher, and I still have that book
[02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:07.160]   in a special place in my bookshelf
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:11.560]   'cause I think it speaks to the nature of human experience,
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:13.840]   right, and I return to it all the time
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:15.720]   'cause there's wisdom there, you know?
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:18.240]   But there's many, many books, so--
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:21.760]   - Fiction or nonfiction, what connects with you usually?
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:23.280]   In the past, for the imagination.
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:26.400]   - I read mostly nonfiction most of the time.
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:28.920]   "Ten Points" is a book I love a lot.
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:30.480]   - What is "Ten Points"?
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:34.120]   - "Ten Points" is, I think his name is Bill Strickland.
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:36.840]   He was the editor of, I think, "Bicycle" magazine,
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:40.200]   or I think it was, and it's sort of his personal memoir
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:44.080]   of his experience growing up with a lot of abuse
[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:46.680]   and how that transformed him as a human being.
[02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:49.240]   You know, one instrumental book for me
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:51.960]   that I bumped into in my early 20s,
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:54.160]   boy, these are all nonfiction,
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:55.760]   except for "The Princess Bride."
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:56.960]   (Lyle laughs)
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:19:59.160]   Have to mention, it's an outlier.
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:02.400]   No, no, "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."
[02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:03.280]   - Yes.
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:05.440]   - I read that in my early 20s,
[02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:10.440]   and I found so many of the principles in that book.
[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:13.260]   - What are the habits from that one?
[02:20:13.260 --> 02:20:15.880]   - Seek first to understand,
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:18.760]   then to be understood is one of them, you know?
[02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:21.180]   The notion of proactivity is one of them.
[02:20:21.180 --> 02:20:25.040]   And so I've held on to some of those principles
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:27.920]   through my life as well, for sure.
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:32.360]   - What have been, you've observed
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:37.080]   suffering, darker aspects of human nature
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:38.880]   in your own personal life,
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:42.960]   what has been some of the darkest moments in your life,
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:45.120]   darkest times in your life?
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:49.400]   Is there something that you went through,
[02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:53.000]   and then perhaps you carry it through your work?
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:53.840]   - Yeah.
[02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:56.520]   Probably one of the darkest moments
[02:20:56.520 --> 02:21:00.840]   was an experience that I had, again, in my early 20s.
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:03.280]   And I was living in Southern California,
[02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:08.760]   and I, you know, the Pacific Coast Highway
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:10.600]   that goes north and south along the beach,
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:13.980]   and there's that little concrete path
[02:21:13.980 --> 02:21:15.440]   that people jog and ride their bikes,
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.080]   and I was riding my bike on the PCH,
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:21.960]   and I was coming up to a corner on it,
[02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:25.820]   and I heard this tremendous crash.
[02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:28.900]   And it was really loud.
[02:21:28.900 --> 02:21:31.520]   And I came around the corner,
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:34.660]   and it was a car accident, a car crash.
[02:21:34.660 --> 02:21:37.980]   It was a multiple vehicle crash.
[02:21:37.980 --> 02:21:42.980]   And what had happened is that a Volvo had hit another car,
[02:21:42.980 --> 02:21:48.020]   and then when it hit it, it went over the top of the car
[02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:50.220]   and hit a Volkswagen van,
[02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:52.740]   and it peeled away the top of the Volkswagen van
[02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:55.060]   when it hit it and then landed.
[02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:58.660]   So three vehicles, and it had just happened.
[02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:04.140]   And lying in the middle of the road
[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:07.380]   was a body decapitated,
[02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:12.460]   and there was another person from one of the cars
[02:22:12.460 --> 02:22:15.380]   lying in the middle of the road, still alive.
[02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:17.920]   And then on the hood of the Volvo
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:22.340]   was this woman who had come through the windshield,
[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:27.340]   just a mess, blood everywhere, moaning back and forth.
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:33.900]   And a bystander ran into the middle of the road
[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:35.940]   and started administering first aid
[02:22:35.940 --> 02:22:38.240]   to the person lying in the road.
[02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:43.240]   And I stood there watching this scene,
[02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:46.740]   and every fiber of my being
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:53.020]   wanted to run to the woman on the hood of the Volvo
[02:22:53.020 --> 02:22:55.980]   and do something, anything, right?
[02:22:55.980 --> 02:22:56.940]   Just to be there.
[02:22:56.940 --> 02:23:00.580]   And it was obvious to me that she was gonna die.
[02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:04.020]   But I felt like at least if I ran there,
[02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:08.180]   I could offer some comfort for her last moment.
[02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:12.100]   And right then, the siren started to blare,
[02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:16.660]   and I knew that there'd be paramedics there within minutes,
[02:23:16.660 --> 02:23:18.960]   that people would come to help.
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:23.540]   And I froze, and I was scared,
[02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:27.040]   and I didn't do anything.
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:31.180]   And I watched while this woman died
[02:23:31.180 --> 02:23:33.620]   on the hood of the Volvo.
[02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:40.780]   And that experience is sort of seared into my consciousness.
[02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:45.740]   The fact that I watched and didn't act,
[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:49.860]   I feel is one of the great failures of my life,
[02:23:49.860 --> 02:23:52.620]   that I wasn't able to act in a moment of need,
[02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:53.900]   no matter how small.
[02:23:53.900 --> 02:23:59.900]   And from that, I made a decision out of that experience
[02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:03.980]   that if I ever found myself in a situation
[02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:05.780]   where I had the ability to act,
[02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:10.500]   and I could act to help another human being in such need,
[02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:15.500]   that I would act, that I wouldn't let fear freeze me.
[02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:21.100]   Instead, I would allow that fear to catalyze me into action
[02:24:21.100 --> 02:24:25.340]   and do something and intervene in whatever way I could,
[02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:27.140]   even if I didn't have the skillset.
[02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:33.260]   - And in some ways, all of that echoes in your documentaries.
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:37.140]   You're not gonna let fear stop you from trying to help.
[02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:40.780]   - I think that experience, that experience of failure,
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:45.180]   what I framed as just human failure on my part,
[02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:49.300]   is foundational, probably, to my work.
[02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:51.540]   Like, I don't want that to happen again, Lex.
[02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:54.900]   Like, I don't want to be that person who watches.
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:57.180]   I want to do what I can when I can.
[02:24:57.180 --> 02:25:02.660]   - If we zoom out, you were just one human
[02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:05.060]   that witnessed that, that trauma.
[02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:09.620]   You're one human that witnessed so much suffering
[02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:11.500]   in different parts of the world.
[02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:15.700]   And as we zoom out across space and time and look at Earth,
[02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:20.700]   why do you think we're here on this Earth?
[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:24.820]   What's the meaning of human civilization?
[02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:29.820]   What's the meaning of your life, of individual human life?
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:33.940]   And broadly speaking, what is the meaning of life?
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:34.780]   (Lex laughing)
[02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:35.820]   Sky Fitzgerald.
[02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:37.300]   - Oh boy, yeah.
[02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:39.800]   (Lex sighing)
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:44.980]   For me, I can speak personally on that only.
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:49.100]   And that's that I believe that the meaning of my life
[02:25:49.100 --> 02:25:52.740]   is to try to make the world a little bit better before I go.
[02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:55.180]   You know, I,
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:26:00.260]   when I was in theater in grad school,
[02:26:00.260 --> 02:26:06.560]   I directed a play called "Shadowlands" by C.S. Lewis.
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:08.720]   And there's a quote from that.
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:10.120]   It goes like this.
[02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:12.120]   "We are like blocks of stone
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:16.240]   out of which the sculptor carves the forms of men.
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:20.160]   The blows of his chisel, which hurt us so much,
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:21.760]   are what make us perfect."
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:26.560]   Now, I would take away the perfect part, right?
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:30.640]   But I think I've remembered that quote for so many years
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:33.920]   because I believe in the underlying notion
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:36.560]   that the blows of the chisel,
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:38.960]   which are the experiences that we go through,
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:40.320]   shape us, right?
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:42.080]   Necessarily so.
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:45.680]   And hopefully shape us into a better human being.
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:48.800]   And in my case, a human being that I hope
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:51.920]   can make the world a little better, you know,
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:53.600]   through those blows.
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:54.760]   - Before it's over.
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:56.800]   - Yeah, before it's over.
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:58.480]   - Before you go, as you said.
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:00.000]   Do you think about that?
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.060]   You think about the going part?
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:05.120]   Your mortality?
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:06.160]   You ever think about that?
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:07.600]   You said you don't have a death wish.
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:09.480]   You try to minimize risk.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:10.840]   But eventually it's gonna be over.
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:12.400]   - Yeah, for all of us.
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:13.240]   Absolutely.
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:14.560]   - Well, speak for yourself.
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:15.600]   (Lex laughing)
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:16.800]   - Well, you've got other plans to sound like.
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:18.280]   - I intend to merge.
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:20.400]   I'm going to merge with robots.
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:21.320]   I mean, embody.
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:22.480]   - Nice.
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:23.400]   - Not at all.
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:26.480]   Yes, for all of us, unfortunately or fortunately,
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:28.480]   or who the heck knows.
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:33.280]   But do you ponder your mortality?
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:34.480]   Are you afraid of it?
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:37.560]   - I live with my mortality,
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:39.880]   knowing that it's fleeting,
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:41.160]   that my life is fleeting,
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:44.200]   and that I'm gonna go into the ground,
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:45.200]   just like everyone else,
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:47.160]   or maybe as ashes, you know?
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:50.320]   So I live with that knowledge every day,
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:54.400]   but I don't allow it to stop me or hold me up.
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:57.880]   Rather, I really, it drives me.
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:00.680]   Right, it drives me to try to get as much done as I can
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:03.000]   before I go, right?
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.720]   - Yeah, so the knowledge of your death
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:07.760]   is a kind of dance partner,
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:09.520]   and you try to dance beautifully.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:13.120]   Sky, you're an incredible human,
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:15.120]   incredible artist and filmmaker,
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:18.040]   and it's a huge honor that you would sit
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:20.920]   and spend your really valuable time with me today.
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:22.400]   I really, really enjoyed this conversation.
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:23.240]   - I did too. - Thank you so much.
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:24.080]   - Thanks for having me, Lex,
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:25.960]   and thanks for doing what you do.
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:27.480]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:29.080]   with Sky Fitzgerald.

[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:36.400]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Elie Wiesel.
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:41.640]   The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:45.800]   The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference.
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:49.800]   The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference.
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:54.800]   And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:57.240]   Thank you for listening,
[02:28:57.240 --> 02:28:59.320]   and I hope to see you next time.
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:01.920]   (upbeat music)
[02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:04.520]   (upbeat music)
