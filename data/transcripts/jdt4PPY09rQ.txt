[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.980]   I'm now personally taking a step into building a startup, first time, hoping to change the
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.420]   world of course.
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.740]   There are thousands, maybe more, maybe millions of other first time entrepreneurs like me.
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.900]   What advice, you've gone through this process, you've talked about the suffering, the emotional
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.660]   turmoil it all might entail, what advice do you have for those people taking that step?
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:38.980]   I'd say it's a rough ride and you have to be psychologically prepared for things going
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.700]   wrong with frequency.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.440]   You have to be prepared to be put in situations where you're being asked to solve problems
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.260]   you didn't even know those problems existed.
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.660]   You know, for example, renting space, it's not really a problem unless you've never done
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.660]   it.
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.140]   You have no idea what a lease looks like, right?
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.420]   You don't even know the relevant rent in a market.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.540]   So everything is new, everything has to be learned.
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.580]   What you realize is that it's good to have other people with you who've had some experience
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.900]   in areas where you don't know what you're doing.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.460]   Unfortunately an entrepreneur starting doesn't know much of anything, so everything is something
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.020]   new.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:37.860]   And I think it's important not to be alone because it's sort of overwhelming and you
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.620]   need somebody to talk to other than a spouse or a loved one because even they get bored
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.100]   with your problems.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.980]   And so, you know, getting a group, you know, if you look at Alibaba, you know, Jack Ma
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.340]   was telling me they basically were like a financial death's door at least twice.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.380]   And you know, the fact that it wasn't just Jack, I mean people think it is because he
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:17.340]   became the sort of public face and the driver, but a group of people who can give advice,
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.080]   share situations to talk about, that's really important.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.620]   And that's not just referring to the small details like renting space.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.620]   No.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.420]   It's also the psychological burden.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.420]   Yes, yeah.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.500]   And you know, because most entrepreneurs at some point question what they're doing because
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.460]   it's not going so well or they're screwing it up and they don't know how to unscrew it
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.060]   up because we're all learning.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.940]   And it's hard to be learning, you know, when there are like 25 variables going on.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.820]   If you, you know, if you're missing four big ones, you can really make a mess.
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:00.820]   And so, the ability to in effect have either an outsider who's really smart that you can
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.260]   rely on for certain type of things or other people who are working with you on a daily
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.740]   basis.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.540]   Most people who haven't had experience believe in the myth of the one person, one great person,
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.340]   you know, makes outcomes, creates outcomes that are positive.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.480]   Most of us, it's not like that.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.380]   If you look back over a lot of the big successful tech companies, it's not typically one person.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.420]   You know, it's, and you will know these stories better than I do because it's your world,
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.420]   not mine.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.700]   But even I know that almost every one of them had two people.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.260]   I mean, if you look at Google, you know, that's what they had and that was the same at Microsoft
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.260]   at the beginning.
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.100]   And, you know, it was the same at Apple.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.580]   You know, people have different skills and they need to play off of other people.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.620]   So you know, the advice that I would give you is make sure you understand that so you
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.500]   don't head off in some direction as a lone wolf and find that either you can't invent
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.340]   all the solutions or you make bad decisions on certain types of things.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.220]   This is a team sport.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.260]   Or means you're alone, in effect.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.980]   And that's the myth.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.700]   But it's mostly a myth.
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.420]   - Yeah, I think, and you talk about this in your book and I could talk to you about it
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.780]   forever, the harshly self-critical aspect to your personality and to mine as well in
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.460]   the face of failure.
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.900]   It's a powerful tool, but it's also a burden.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.900]   It's very interesting, very interesting to walk that line.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.020]   But let me ask in terms of people around you, in terms of friends, in the bigger picture
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.340]   of your own life, where do you put the value of love, family, friendship in the big picture
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.060]   journey of your life?
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.780]   - Well, ultimately all journeys are alone.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.220]   It's great to have support.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:34.380]   And when you go forward and say your job is to make something work and that's your number
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:42.580]   one priority, and you're gonna work at it to make it work, it's like superhuman effort.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.340]   People don't become successful as part-time workers.
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.500]   Doesn't work that way.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:59.940]   And if you're prepared to make that 100 to 120% effort, you're gonna need support and
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.380]   you're gonna have to have people involved with your life who understand that that's
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.060]   really part of your life.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.820]   Sometimes you're involved with somebody and they don't really understand that and that's
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.780]   a source of conflict and difficulty.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:28.820]   But if you're involved with the right people, whether it's a dating relationship or a spousal
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:43.260]   relationship, you have to involve them in your life but not burden them with every minor
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.460]   triumph or mistake.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:52.140]   They actually get bored with it after a while and so you have to set up different types
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.580]   of ecosystems.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:01.860]   You have your home life, you have your love life, you have children, and that's like the
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.500]   enduring part of what you do.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:14.540]   And then on the other side, you've got the sort of unpredictable nature of this type
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.020]   of work.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:24.860]   What I say to people at my firm who are younger, usually, well everybody's younger, but people
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:33.180]   who are of an age where they're just having their first child or maybe they have two children,
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:44.300]   that it's important to make sure they go away with their spouse at least once every two
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:51.540]   months to just some lovely place where there are no children, no issues.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:57.220]   Sometimes once a month if they're sort of energetic and clever.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.380]   - Escape the craziness of it all.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:07.020]   - Yeah, and reaffirm your values as a couple.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.520]   And you have to have fun.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.900]   If you don't have fun with the person you're with and all you're doing is dealing with
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.420]   issues then that gets pretty old.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:24.980]   And so you have to protect the fun element of your life together and the way to do that
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:31.260]   isn't by hanging around the house and dealing with sort of more problems.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:36.900]   You have to get away and reinforce and reinvigorate your relationship.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:42.140]   And whenever I tell one of our younger people about that, they sort of look at me and it's
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.620]   like the scales are falling off of their eyes and they're saying, "Geez, I hadn't thought
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.620]   about that.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.820]   I'm so enmeshed in all these things."
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.420]   But that's a great idea.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:56.460]   And that's something as an entrepreneur you also have to do.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.780]   You just can't let relationships slip because you're half overwhelmed.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:09.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:19.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
