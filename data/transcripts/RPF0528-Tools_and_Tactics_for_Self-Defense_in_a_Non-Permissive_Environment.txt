[00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:07.540]   I think this week we're going to merge a little bit of current events with some practical discussion.
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:20.480]   Certainly over the last week and a half our nation here in the United States of America has been rocked by the most recent shooting in South Florida, here where I live. The Parkland community is relatively close to me.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:49.140]  , and it certainly had an impact here in the local discussion. But I think more importantly our country is being rocked by this discussion. And of course that has an impact on you and on me and on your finances and on my finances and our ability to live together in a culture where we all see and understand different things, we all have different perspectives, different opinions, how to live at peace with one another.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:03:17.800]  , and I've become deeply frustrated with how to express those opinions. We all I think have an outlet. We all need an outlet. It seems like for many of us our emotions are just kind of boiling under the surface. I think it's especially hard for people like me who don't have a workplace environment with many people that you see every day that you can talk about these things with and we're primarily left with a digital method of communication.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.080]   This week I'm going to tackle we're calling it radical personal finance gun week. Now does this relate to finance? Well I think when you hear the titles that I have planned the answer is yes absolutely. For example today is tools and tactics for self-defense in a non-permissive environment like a school. And I'm going to give you some very practical advice that may help you if you're ever caught in a situation like a school shooting.

[00:07:45.080 --> 00:08:15.060]   ado. I'm going to take a look at some of the steps. Number one of course is getaway. You know what? Number one is not getaway. Number one is don't be there. I need to add that to my outline right now. Number one is don't be there. Most of the time for you to maintain your physical security, the best path for you is just simply don't be there. More on this in a moment. Number one is don't be there. Number two is getaway. Number three is hide. Number four is protect yourself. Number five is fight back. Six is treat injury and seven is communicate.

[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:45.100]   This is my simple outline to give you some practical ideas. So instead of getting mad at somebody and just arguing about how to change the mind of 150 of your million of your fellow citizens on a topic such as gun control and gun legislation, you can actually do something. So don't be there. Obviously, one of the biggest challenges is not to be in an environment which is unsafe. Sometimes you can control that. Sometimes you can't. And I want today's show to be not so politically controversial. So I'm not going to be there.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:09:15.140]  , but I'm going to be there.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:45.180]  , but I'm going to be there.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:10:15.220]  , but I'm going to be there.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:45.260]   and I'm not going to be there.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:45.280]   It's not a place that is unsafe. It's not a country that's unsafe. It's usually not a country that's unsafe. It's usually a relatively small number of neighborhoods in a handful of cities that are unsafe. If you came to my town and asked me what part of town to avoid, I would tell you you need to avoid this part of town.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:45.280]   If you came to my town and asked me what part of town to avoid, I would tell you you you need to avoid this part of town.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:45.280]   If you came to my town and asked me what part of town to avoid, I would tell you you you need to avoid this part of town.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:54.320]   Or, "It's probably fine during the daytime, but don't go there at night."
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   Or, "Hey, it's really common that the pickpockets are active on the subway station, so make sure you're paying extra attention when you're at a subway station."
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.320]   Or, "Hey, it's really common that the pickpockets are active on the subway station, so make sure you're paying extra attention when you're at a subway station."

[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   So don't be there in the first place would be the idea.

We don't have to deal with 100 million people to do that. You just have to think, maybe I should keep a pair of athletic shoes in my desk drawer. And if I were trying to run out from a real fire, I want some shoes on my feet. Those are some ideas of mine.

[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:18.820]   Excuse me, I forgot one comment on getting away.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:26.000]   Obviously, there are times in which getting away doesn't solve the problem. If my wife and I and my children and I are accosted on the street, and I may be able to get away, but my wife and children cannot. In that situation, I'm not saying run, but tell your wife and kids to run, and you deal with the situation.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   And I'm not saying run.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   But getting away is not a good idea.

[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:55.880]   But getting away is generally the best strategy for surviving the fight. And in a situation where the rule of law is consistent, your best case is to do your fighting in court, not on the street. After getaway, hide. Now, of course, hiding is what is taught to children. But hiding really is, in my understanding, of the current protocols in place for school shootings. Hiding makes sense in many situations.

[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:38.440]   Maybe you need an extra piece of furniture in your office so that you'd have a place to hide.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.580]   Maybe it's the closet next door to you and if you just had a copy of that key, that would give you a place to hide.

[00:21:45.540 --> 00:22:05.820]   And think about it now.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:05.900]   Wouldn't be a bad idea to make a list of one, two or three places.

It's incredible. I know it's cheap, 40 bucks. I've mentioned it on the show before. But having a good flashlight would be valuable. If I were a teacher and I was thinking, how am I going to protect my room, I would consider having a few flashlights in there.

[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:23.580]   It's hard if you've got first graders, but if you're dealing with a class full of juniors, if you had a bag or a drawer with three or four flashlights in it, that might give you the ability to distract somebody who's coming into the door with a gun. I think the protocol that is usually taught is lights off, everybody quiet, everybody in the back of the room hiding somehow. Well, at least distribute some flashlights. You may have the ability to distract somebody. In some cases, another good distraction device to have handy is an alarm, like a loud horn or a siren. One of the most common distractions is a siren.

[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:23.040]   frequently the passengers on an airplane
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.040]   would have gone along with the demands of the hijacker
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.640]   They would have been passive
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.340]   They would have sat still and complied with all the demands
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.840]   knowing we're going to land somewhere, there's going to be a hostage negotiation, we're going to be rescued
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.340]   I think 9/11 changed all that
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:41.440]   It's hard for me to imagine at least an American uh, airliner

[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:41.440]   It's hard for me to imagine at least an American uh, airliner

[01:17:41.580 --> 01:18:11.080]  , probably globally, but it's hard for me to imagine an American airliner
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   that were hijacked by terrorists where basically all the passengers didn't fight back
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   or at least didn't move in that direction
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   You put three people or four hijackers up against a plane load of angry people?
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   Yes, the guns will kill some people, but at the end of the day the three or four against the plane load of angry people are going to lose.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   Now, they may drive it into the ground
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   Yes, the guns will kill some people, but at the end of the day the three or four against the plane load of angry people are going to lose.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   I don't know that's a good idea, but I'm not going to do that.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.120]   That's a problem.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.120]   But even in some of these active shooter environments,
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.920]   about the only one that was tactically impossible is Las Vegas.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.120]   And the details on that are so, still so unclear as we wait for the official reports.
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:27.920]   But that was the only one that I've looked at that was kind of basically tactically impossible.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.720]   I wonder sometimes if these things are going to change.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.720]   As far as when people instead of just running, which is the right solution,
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.720]   are going to fight back and especially when there are crowds of people.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.520]   I don't know.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.720]   I'm not, I don't, haven't
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   I'm not, I haven't
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   I haven't
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   reviewed
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   I haven't
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   reviewed
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   the plane load of angry people.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   I don't know.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   I'm not, I haven't
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   I haven't
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   reviewed the plane load of an airliner,
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   and I haven't
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:19:03.360]   I haven't reviewed the reports and I would, I wouldn't venture an opinion past that.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:10.360]   But I think the same thing is going to happen. I do. So after fighting back, then the last two is treating injury. Treat injury. So be prepared to treat injury. There's no reason in the world. If you're concerned about safety and physical safety, you may not be allowed to have a gun. But there's no reason why you can't have a trauma kit. A good first aid kit with some tourniquets. There's no reason why you can't take some training on how to have a gun.

You live on mud, California, but in Mexico City you live on basically a big mud flat that is an awful place to live with regard to earthquake risk, so your kit needs to have a radio. And something with charged batteries, you should have some extra lithium batteries in there, so that if you're trapped inside of a building, the rescuers will be able to get you out of the way.

[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:24.420]   I don't think you can guarantee a zero death casualty event. But you may be able to protect the lives of your students. And you may be able to cut the death toll from 17 to 11. And that's really worth doing. So don't be lazy and spend all your time arguing about things that are unsolvable. The gun control debate is absolutely intractable. I'll give you my thoughts in a minute.

But what you can do is you can say, what are some practical steps that I can take in response to this that may help me within my sphere of sovereignty within my jurisdiction to improve things. I think that's worth doing and I hope you do too.
