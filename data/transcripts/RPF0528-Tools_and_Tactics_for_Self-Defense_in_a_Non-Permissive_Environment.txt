[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Here at Radical Personal Finance, there are two themes that I consciously continually
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.400]   explore with you in various ways and using different methods as seem practical to me
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.400]   at the time.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.600]   And those themes are living a rich life now and then building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.240]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.080]   When I built that tagline, which you hear in probably 70 to 80% of the shows where I
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.800]   lead off by giving you that tagline, I was very intentional about it because it expresses
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.940]   what I want to talk about.
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.060]   It gives you some ideas, but it also gives me as a host of this show a pretty wide degree
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.080]   of latitude.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.520]   That wide degree of latitude keeps me coming back to do the show for you, say three days
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.400]   a week at the moment.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.480]   Because if I just came to come and talk to you about IRAs or life insurance every day,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.480]   I couldn't do this.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.480]   I really couldn't.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.240]   I don't make enough money doing a podcast to interest me in doing that.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.240]   I'd go back and make millions in commissions and fees if that were what I wanted to do.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.120]   So I need that creative license.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.120]   I do think that the show has been a little light on specific tactics and nuts and bolts
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.040]   on finance the last few months.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.320]   I have the intention of changing that.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.680]   Discussion on why it hasn't changed yet is unimportant for today's show.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.080]   But in the vein of discussing issues that are important, that are practical, especially
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.800]   that relate to your having and living a rich life, I think this week we're going to merge
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.720]   a little bit of current events with some practical discussion.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.780]   Certainly over the last week and a half, our nation here in the United States of America
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.180]   has been rocked by the most recent shooting in South Florida, here where I live.
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.820]   The Parkland community is relatively close to me and it certainly had an impact here
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.820]   in the local discussion.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.280]   But I think more importantly, our country is being rocked by this discussion.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.360]   And of course that has an impact on you and on me and on your finances and on my finances
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.920]   and our ability to live together in a culture where we all see and understand different
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   things.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.200]   We all have different perspectives, different opinions, how to live at peace with one another.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.760]   Of course, I, like you, have my own opinions and I've become deeply frustrated with how
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.160]   to express those opinions.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.840]   We all, I think, have an outlet.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.840]   We all need an outlet.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.200]   And it seems like for many of us, our emotions are just kind of boiling under the surface.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.520]   I think it's especially hard for people like me who don't have a workplace environment
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.000]   with many people that you see every day that you can talk about these things with.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.320]   And we're primarily left with a digital method of communication.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.200]   So this week I'm going to tackle, we're calling it Radical Personal Finance Gun Week.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.240]   Now, does this relate to finance?
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.640]   Well, I think when you hear the titles that I have planned, the answer is yes, absolutely.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.160]   For example, today is tools and tactics for self-defense in a non-permissive environment
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.160]   like a school.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.320]   And I'm going to give you some very practical advice that may help you if you're ever caught
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.120]   in a situation like a school shooting, may help you to protect your children if your
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.200]   children are in the government schools and you're concerned about giving them something
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   practical.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.760]   I am so deeply frustrated at the fact that nobody wants to have, it seems to me, let
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.720]   me be careful, it feels to me and seems to me like nobody wants to have a practical discussion
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.240]   about what you can do.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.680]   Instead, we all want to argue about how to change the minds of 150 million people instead
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.840]   of saying, "Here's something that you can do."
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.640]   And so today I'm going to give you something that you can do.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.760]   That's my goal.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.080]   And at least get you thinking because if you're dead, well, I can't really help you live that
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.840]   rich life, can I?
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.640]   If your kids are dead, well, that's going to really impact your life.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yes, that's blunt, but that's the reality.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.120]   And so that's why I'm tackling this subject this week.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.160]   Now I do recognize that some of what I have to say will be different than what you currently
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.160]   believe.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.160]   So here's my intention.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.000]   I have four shows lined up in the shoot.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.560]   Today is Tools and Tactics for Self-Defense in a Non-Permissive Environment.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.640]   Another two working titles that I think will give you good practical advice that I hear
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.920]   very few people buying, but one will be How to Assemble a Quality Home Armory on a Budget.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.040]   One will be How to Buy an AR-15, How to Buy Your First AR-15.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.440]   But of course, I think I need to do a standalone show.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.840]   Current working title is The Moral Case for You to Have a Closet Full of Guns.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.800]   And that one will not be practical in the sense of nuts and bolts financial advice.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.040]   It will be philosophical and moral, but I believe that I need to deliver that one to
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.920]   you in case you are concerned with some of my topics for this week.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   So let's get into it.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   Enough preamble today.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.160]   Tools and Tactics for Self-Defense in a Non-Permissive Environment.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.520]   The use of the word non-permissive environment is something like a school.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's a fairly common word in the modern self-defense training industry or in the modern firearms
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   culture.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.280]   A non-permissive environment is some place where you're not allowed to carry a gun to
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.960]   protect yourself.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.120]   So if you're looking for non-gun options to protect yourself or protect your children,
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.520]   that's what today is focused on.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.520]   And this is a challenge that many people face.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:48.300]   Now, of course, many teachers in many of our states face this challenge quite acutely.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.680]   Most teachers are not allowed to carry guns in schools.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.520]   Supposedly schools are gun-free zones where you're not supposed to have a gun.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.000]   Now, of course, the term in and of itself is an obvious lie that there seem to be plenty
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.840]   of guns in schools, but you're not supposed to have a gun in a school.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.960]   And so somebody like a teacher or a coach or an administrator who's trying to protect
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.080]   themselves and their students faces a challenge.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.480]   How do I do it if I can't carry a gun legally?
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.600]   Now, of course, this is something that faces many other people.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.040]   Whether you work in a business that – where the business owner or the administrators of
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:30.040]   that business or of that environment restrict your right to carry a firearm to protect yourself
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   in that context.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.840]   This is called a non-permissive environment.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.040]   Another example would be going to a concert where they say, "No weapons allowed,"
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.180]   or some other similar place.
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.800]   Business puts up a sign on the front door and says, "Yes, you may be able to carry
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.400]   a gun in other places, but you can't carry a gun here."
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.480]   I want to give you some ideas, but I'm especially, of course, thinking about school
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.240]   shootings and what the tactics and techniques you need and what you need to teach your children
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.000]   in order to have a higher probability of surviving such an event.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.080]   And also, you may be able to take some of these and apply them to other environments.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.160]   But here's my outline of what you need to do to engage in self-defense in an environment
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   like a school.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.280]   I have a few steps.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.760]   Number one, of course, is get away.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.760]   Number one is not get away.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.360]   Number one is don't be there.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.600]   I need to add that to my outline right now.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.680]   Number one is don't be there.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.560]   Most of the time, for you to maintain your physical security, the best path for you is
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.040]   just simply don't be there.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   More on this in a moment.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   So number one is don't be there.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.280]   Number two is get away.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.840]   Number three is hide.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.760]   Number four is protect yourself.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.400]   Number five is fight back.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   Six is treat injury.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.080]   And seven is communicate.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.000]   This is my simple outline to give you some practical ideas.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.360]   So instead of getting mad at somebody and just arguing about how to change the mind
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:58.520]   of 150 million of your fellow citizens on a topic such as gun control and gun legislation,
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.280]   you can actually do something.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   So don't be there.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.880]   Obviously, one of the biggest challenges is not to be in an environment which is unsafe.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.600]   Sometimes you can control that.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.280]   Sometimes you can't.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.440]   And I want today's show to be not so politically controversial.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.840]   So I'm not going to talk about pulling your kids out of government schools.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.160]   But you know that I don't understand why your children are in a government school.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.920]   I think that government schools are at the core of this problem because of the culture
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.080]   that they create.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.200]   I'll talk about that when I do the political show in and of itself.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.660]   But always, your best bet is whenever possible, just avoid being in a dangerous environment.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:42.320]   If you don't go to stupid places to do stupid things with stupid people, you can often avoid
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.680]   a fight.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.380]   If you know that trouble is brewing and you leave, you can often avoid a fight.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:55.040]   And you always, always, always want to avoid a physical violent confrontation.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.800]   They don't help.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.740]   Physical violent confrontations just don't help.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.480]   So always try to avoid.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.400]   And it's pretty simple.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.180]   Don't be a jerk.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.780]   And don't be a jerk in other places.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.060]   If we were doing this show on the topic of travel, for example, if you'll just simply
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:16.680]   not be stupid and not be a jerk to people, you can avoid many of the problem situations.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.900]   You can travel the world without a bit of tactical weaponry.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.500]   You can travel the world without any devices for self-defense.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.360]   And for the most part, you could probably be fine if you just use your wits and open
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.560]   your eyes and ask people for advice.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.460]   For example, when you're traveling, no matter what country you're in, you need to ask people,
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.700]   "Is it safe to go to a place?"
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:44.380]   You can travel into Iraq today probably pretty safely if you'll just simply ask the local
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.040]   people who are hosting you in your travels, "Hey, is it safe for me to go to such and
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.260]   such a place?"
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.660]   Most of the time, people have this weird idea that a country is unsafe.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.180]   It's usually not a country that's unsafe.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:06.140]   It's usually a relatively small number of neighborhoods in a handful of cities that
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.900]   are unsafe.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.540]   If you came to my town and asked me what part of town to avoid, I would tell you, "You
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.620]   need to avoid this part of town."
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.980]   If I came to your town, you would tell me, "You should avoid this part of town."
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.620]   Or "It's probably fine during the day time, but don't go there at night."
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.580]   Or "Hey, it's really common that the pickpockets are active on the subway station, so make
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.860]   sure you're paying extra attention when you're at a subway station."
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.380]   So don't be there in the first place would be the idea.
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.020]   Now of course, that's more difficult in a context of a school shooting if you've
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.340]   already made the decision that, "Yes, my child is going to be here," or, "Yes,
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.860]   you're a teacher," or, "You're a spouse of a teacher," and you're saying, "Well,
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.860]   I've got to be there.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.700]   I've made the decision to be there."
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.300]   So if you are in a situation where you have difficult things going on, where someone,
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.380]   let's just stay with the idea of an active shooter in a school, your first option and
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.740]   first and best choice is always get away.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.540]   Run away.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.780]   Running away is always the best first choice.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.660]   No matter the situation, run away from the fight.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.160]   Run away from the fight.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:23.460]   If you can get away, and if you can get those who are involved away, run away.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.780]   When you're in a situation like a school shooter, run away.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.260]   And of course, that's what you're trained on.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.340]   That's what of course the children are trained on by the administration and whatever law
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.400]   enforcement is doing the training is that if possible, get away.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.540]   If you're at a concert and there's somebody that starts shooting up the place or shooting
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.660]   off a bomb, run away.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.620]   Get away as fast as you can.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:51.660]   If you will just simply run, generally you can avoid much of the problems, especially
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.100]   if you're dealing with somebody with a gun.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.920]   Most people are not that skilled with a gun.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:06.260]   Even people who train consistently, such as some everyday walk in the beat police officers
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.420]   are not that good with a gun.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.540]   If you look at the statistics on police gunfights, which are well recorded, and you look at the
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:19.840]   number of rounds that a police officer will often shoot in a gunfight versus the number
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.080]   of hits, it is horrendously low.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:30.960]   So just simply running away, even if somebody has a gun, may frequently save your life.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.160]   It may also save your life because instead of getting multiple wounds, multiple bullets
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:42.400]   in your body, maybe you just have one or two, those are frequently survivable wounds.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:49.960]   Instead of you sitting still and getting a pump full of multiple rounds of lead, one
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.440]   or two bullet wounds are frequently very survivable, especially if they're from a handgun.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.020]   Most shootings are with a handgun and not with a rifle.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.640]   So get away.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.080]   So in your planning and in your thinking, you should consider how do I get away?
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.240]   Well, of course, you're going to be running.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.400]   So if you're in an environment where running may be difficult, then think about how to
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.940]   keep quality shoes handy.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.000]   If you work in an environment such as a teacher, and especially if you're a woman, if you're
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.120]   a female teacher, you are probably going to be wearing on a daily basis shoes that are
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:32.620]   more, if there's a scale between fashion and function, that'll tend more towards the fashion
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.840]   instead of the function.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.760]   It'd be an unusual teacher who'd want to go to work every day wearing a pair of combat
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.080]   boots or a pair of running shoes.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.680]   It'd be more frequent that there would be some footwear that at least gives the nod
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.500]   to fashion.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.120]   If you are a man and you're working in an environment where there's a higher dress standard
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:56.240]   with your shoes, then you need to think about that and keep a pair of shoes handy that you
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.000]   might be able to use to run away.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.400]   The scenarios will be different.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.960]   And again, please, in everything that I say today, you translate this for your own scenario.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:12.520]   Dealing with a school shooter who just walked in the door of your classroom with a rifle
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.640]   raised, ready to kill everybody in the room, obviously you're not going to stop, take a
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:23.080]   moment, pull your running shoes out of your desk drawer and strap them on before running.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:28.440]   But if you hear gunshots down the road or down the hall, you better believe that if
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.920]   I'm going to run and I'm wearing high heels, I'm not sure why I would be wearing high heels,
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.440]   but in today's world, I guess that probably isn't that far of a stretch.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.320]   But if I'm wearing high heels and I hear gunshots in the distance, I'm going to take a moment,
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.360]   I'm going to slip on some boots or some shoes.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.480]   So keep, if you are usually in a situation like this where you're concerned about your
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.600]   life, keep shoes handy.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.040]   That would allow you to be able to run.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.000]   This is also important if you were dealing with something like a fire.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.680]   If you work in high heels, keep some slip-on boots or slip-on shoes handy so that if you
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.520]   needed to run away in a fire, you would have some foot protection to protect your feet
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.200]   from stumbling over something or walking on embers.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.680]   I can't even imagine trying to face a situation, you work at the top of a tower, you work at
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.880]   the top of the World Trade Center and you got to run down the stairs.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.600]   I can't imagine saying, "Okay, I'm going to run down these stairs in high heels," or,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.040]   "I'm going to take my high heels off and run down barefoot when a building is collapsing
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.280]   around you."
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.840]   So if you're in an earthquake environment or you're concerned about the risk of a fire
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.880]   in the building, make sure that as part of your personal standard operating procedures
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.040]   for such an event, that you have good shoes handy that you can put on quickly, that you
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.720]   can slip them on so that you can get away.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.500]   Another thing to consider is, especially if you're in an environment like a classroom,
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.680]   keep a little bag handy with some useful tools.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.240]   I'm going to give you a bunch of potentially useful tools in today's show, but some useful
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.000]   tools that might be useful to you to be able to get away.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.240]   For example, it would be very important if you were getting away and were being pursued
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:17.400]   by somebody to have some means of blocking a door, some means of wedging or blocking
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.680]   a door after you go through if you were being pursued.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:26.640]   In a moment I'll talk about protecting yourself and blocking the room.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.920]   One of the most effective ways to diminish the body count of things like a school shooting
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:38.680]   is to block when people are hiding and barricading in the room, to block the doors.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.860]   There are a lot of security companies that are really pushing this ability, not just
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:48.780]   a simple lock, which can be shot out, kicked through, etc., but a good blocking mechanism
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.780]   to block the door.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.620]   But you can do that yourself with a couple of door wedges.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.120]   You can make some door wedges out of a piece of plywood, go on YouTube just for how to
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.320]   do a door wedge.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:03.560]   But if you are at your workplace and you're concerned about somebody coming in and shooting
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.000]   up the place, an angry co-worker dealing with an active shooter situation, you may want
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.240]   the means to be able to block them out of the room.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.520]   In which case, you grab a couple of door wedges, keep a hammer and a little bag, bang those
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.560]   door wedges in there and you can wedge the door.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.920]   Same thing applies when you're traveling and you need to protect yourself in a hotel
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.240]   room, etc., but a couple of rubber door wedges that you buy commercially or a couple of wooden
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.400]   ones that you build yourself could really be effective in helping you to protect yourself
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.000]   from somebody having access to you.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.600]   So in getting away, that might be a useful tool to have if you were being pursued, the
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.680]   ability to wedge or block a door behind you and stop somebody from pursuing you.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.680]   Whenever possible, get away, run away.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.660]   Think about the scenario that you're concerned with.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:57.100]   Whenever I hear or read the details of a scenario like this, I always try to think, "Well, what
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.100]   would help?"
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.060]   I do the same with financial planning, technical financial planning.
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.940]   Read a story about a couple that had saved money, bought a sailboat and they were going
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.340]   to go travel the world and they wound up sinking the sailboat.
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:13.100]   And they were out of money doing a GoFundMe account with their news article trying to
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.100]   get money to help them buy a new sailboat because they couldn't fulfill their dream.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.500]   When I hear that, I stop and I think and I say, "Well, what would help this couple have
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.740]   survived this?"
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:27.940]   In that case, it was fairly obvious, buy an insurance policy or buy a cheap enough sailboat
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.040]   that it's not going to be the end of your money if you don't want to buy insurance.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.260]   They made those two classic errors and now they're financially destitute, lost the sailboat,
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.260]   lost their dream.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.620]   They'll have to restart and build from zero.
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:44.600]   But when I hear about a school shooting and I hear that a new common tactic for a shooter
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:50.760]   to gain access to easy targets, to build for himself a target-rich environment is to set
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:57.780]   off a fire alarm, then I think, "Hmm, well, if I'm wearing high heels, maybe before leaving
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.220]   the room with my children, I should take those high heels off, grab a pair of slip-on athletic
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.420]   shoes or slip-on boots and put those on before leading my children out in a fire alarm."
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.500]   I don't know if any teachers do that or not, but I at least think that's a good idea.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.020]   And we don't have to pass legislation.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.460]   We don't have to deal with 100 million people to do that.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:20.000]   You just have to think, "Maybe I should keep a pair of athletic shoes in my desk drawer."
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.820]   And if I were trying to run out from a real fire, I want some shoes on my feet.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.020]   Those are some ideas of getting away.
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.900]   The next major tactic, of course, is if you can't get away, you hide.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.380]   Excuse me, I forgot one comment on getting away.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.480]   Obviously, there are times in which getting away doesn't solve the problem.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.700]   If my wife and I and my children and I are accosted on the street and I may be able to
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:52.540]   get away, but my wife and children cannot, in that situation, I'm not saying run, but
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.380]   tell your wife and kids to run and you deal with the situation.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.760]   But getting away is generally the best strategy for surviving the fight.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:07.120]   And in a situation where the rule of law is consistent, your best case is to do your fighting
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.540]   in court, not on the street.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.980]   After get away, hide.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:18.620]   Now, of course, hiding is what is taught to children, but hiding really is, in my understanding
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:26.380]   of the current protocols in place for school shootings, hiding makes sense in many situations.
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.900]   So think about that.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.280]   I don't have any unique insight into this other than what is commonly taught as far
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:40.300]   as concealment for the...conceal yourself so that no one knows you're in there, if possible,
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.420]   until you're sure it's actually the police going room to room and not some active shooter.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:49.180]   But if you are in a workplace environment, not a school, not where your employer is not
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.420]   giving you training on what the school's protocol is for this, look around your office right
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:59.540]   now and think, where would I hide?
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.280]   Maybe a little bit of rearranging of your furniture would be helpful.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.180]   Maybe you need an extra piece of furniture in your office so that you'd have a place
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.260]   to hide.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:13.420]   Just maybe it's the closet next door to you and if you just had a copy of that key, that
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.340]   would give you a place to hide.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:19.380]   But think about if there were a situation where I needed to hide, where would I hide?
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.380]   And think about it now.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.180]   Wouldn't be a bad idea to make a list of one, two, or three places.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.740]   If this is available, I'll go in this direction.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.420]   If this is available, I'll go in that direction.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.940]   But sometimes if you can't get away, if your situation, the tactical situation is such
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:36.900]   that you can't escape without being shot at, then finding a good hiding place could be
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.620]   really valuable.
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.380]   And you could take this and apply this to your own thinking as far as your house.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.100]   Do your children know where they're supposed to hide if somebody invades your home?
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.100]   Where are they going to hide?
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.100]   Where are you going to hide?
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.700]   Where is your place to take a stand?
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.100]   Where are you going to hide?
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.240]   And what's necessary for that hiding?
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.300]   Next is protect yourself.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:01.540]   And by protect yourself, I just mean passive defense.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.540]   Passive defense.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:09.060]   There's a difference between passive measures of defense and active measures of defense.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.220]   Passive defense would be something like blocking the room, blocking a door.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.300]   I spoke a moment ago about having door wedges.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:23.220]   So if you were going to hide in your office and you're concerned about a workplace shooting,
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:28.700]   then one of your passive measures of defense to protect yourself would be block the door.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:35.240]   If the door to your office opens in, then you need to be prepared with some door wedges.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.900]   These could be the small rubber wedges that are commercially made, maybe two or three
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.640]   of them, and a hammer to bang them in under the door, good and strong.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.700]   This could be some small wooden blocks that you make out of a 1x4, 2x4, and a hammer again
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.100]   to hammer those in.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:57.640]   This may be something like a door bar that you can buy commercially, the type that goes
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:03.540]   up against the door handle and uses a rubber stop to block the door.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.180]   Cheap and easy way to protect your door if you live in an apartment or a dorm room, something
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.980]   like that, in case somebody were to try to break the door down.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:16.060]   If you have the ability, for example, if you own the building, you might want to consider
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.140]   a better blocking mechanism.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:22.140]   If you were an executive or a small business owner and you had the – you own the building
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.220]   and you have the ability to drill into the floor, then it would be a good idea to go
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.900]   ahead and purchase something like the night lock door barricades that you install a small
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.660]   bracket into the door, but if you ever needed to totally block that door, you go ahead and
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.880]   install the – just slide the little thing right in and it blocks the door.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:44.700]   So having the ability to block the door would be very helpful as a passive measure of defense
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.700]   to protect yourself.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.500]   In a moment, we'll talk about active defense, fighting back.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:55.800]   Other examples would be perhaps thinking about how would I block the door additionally.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.900]   If I were a teacher, I would be looking at where I chose to put the bookcases in my room
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.940]   or where I chose to put the filing cabinet in my room and I would consider, do I have
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:10.060]   the ability to put a filing cabinet near the door so that if I had to block it, it were
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:14.200]   an inward opening door and I couldn't – my door wedges didn't work, could I push a
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.660]   filing cabinet over to block the door and keep somebody from being able to get in or
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:25.660]   push a bookcase over or slide it in some way so that it would be harder to open the door.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.260]   Think about how you would protect yourself.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.260]   If you were – if it opened outward, then you would consider, well, is there some kind
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:38.340]   of mechanism that I could use to help keep that door from opening outward.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:43.340]   Next in terms of protecting yourself, go behind cover if at all possible.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.760]   Go behind cover.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.980]   When you teach firearms training or you teach self-defense, one thing that a trainer will
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:55.900]   be very – and the military as well, be very clear on is the difference between concealment
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.700]   and cover.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:03.760]   Concealment is anything that would block the vision of an attacker for them not being able
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.540]   to see you.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:12.100]   So a wall is concealment because the person is not able to see you.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.180]   But it's not cover.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:19.660]   Cover is anything that can stop the penetration of a bullet from being able to actually penetrate
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.660]   the target.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:26.740]   I guess if we want to be technical, a lot of times gun people and self-defense trainers
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.860]   will make a difference between penetration and perforation.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.460]   The word perforate would be when a bullet would go through both sides of something and
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.940]   penetration would be when a bullet would just come right into something.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.680]   So if a bullet is penetrating a body, it comes in only one side.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.980]   If it's perforating a body, it comes – it gets in and out and the same thing would apply
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.840]   to cover.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:57.180]   So the point that is driven home in good training is that cover and concealment are different
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.180]   things.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.220]   So if you were in a situation where there's a shooter wandering the hallway with a rifle
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:08.500]   and you are hiding in a closet with the lights off, you might be concealed from the shooter.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.980]   If the shooter is unaware of your presence there, you may survive.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:19.440]   But if they become aware of your presence there in a concealed fashion, a few rounds
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:26.040]   from – a few high-velocity normal rifle rounds from a rifle will perforate the wall
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.480]   – most normal walls.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:38.680]   A drywall or plaster wall or cement wall can be easily perforated by most normal rifles.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.920]   So concealment is not cover.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:46.080]   But if you're concerned about protecting yourself, if you could take cover, then you
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.800]   may be able to do so.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.420]   So in this case, let's say that you have the ability of a filing cabinet and that filing
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.960]   cabinet is filled with papers and books.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:01.240]   Now you transform what is concealment into cover.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.680]   Now if you're a teacher and you're protecting a class full of children, I don't know how
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.240]   to put 30 children behind a filing cabinet.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.680]   I don't have that answer.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.160]   But if you're just dealing with yourself and your own body, then the filing cabinet
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.200]   filled with books could be very helpful.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:24.840]   If it's appropriate to the specifics of your situation, it might be worth your collecting.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.680]   Go on Craigslist and find somebody who has a garage full of phone books and fill a filing
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.960]   cabinet up with phone books.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:39.720]   Depending on the velocity of a round, a small, let's talk about AR-15s for a moment.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.680]   An AR-15 is a relatively small bullet that it actually shoots.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.440]   It comes out at a high velocity, but the actual bullet itself is relatively small and it has
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.680]   very limited ability to perforate cover.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:58.640]   That's one of the reasons why historically the military hasn't wanted, why many soldiers
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.000]   in the past were equipped with much larger rifles than something like an AR-15.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.480]   But if you're going up against a shooter with an AR-15 that's shooting a relatively small
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:14.320]   bullet, then a filing cabinet full of books, I didn't look up any numbers, but my guess
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:21.140]   would be that an AR-15, just a standard 5.56 millimeter round out of an AR-15 would probably
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.640]   not go through more than three or four inches of dense paper like phone books.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.040]   So you can create something that would be cover, whether that cover is natural, you
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.200]   have a filing cabinet stuffed full, or whether it's something that you create intentionally.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.720]   Maybe you only use the front two feet of a file drawer, but you fill the back up with
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.120]   phone books.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.080]   In any case, look around your office, look around your room and consider where is the
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   cover?
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.600]   If you could push that bookcase over in front of the door, that bookcase will give you additional
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.960]   ballistic protection.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.720]   It'll give you additional cover because of those thick books, and you may be able to
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.600]   generate or create additional cover.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.800]   And so make a plan, I'd push the bookcase over, I'd push the couch against it, or we're
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.540]   going to stack the desks.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.440]   Some of this is trained, I don't know how much of this is trained.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.840]   I just, I don't know.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   And of course that would depend.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.240]   So I'm just giving you my best ideas from the principles that I'm aware of.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.720]   In addition, as far as protecting yourself, then we can get into the world of personal
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.920]   protection.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:26.520]   What elements of personal protection for your actual body would be helpful?
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:31.160]   In this case, your primary vital organs are of course primarily in your chest.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.080]   So is there a way that you could design to protect your chest?
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:40.520]   You, there's, although there may be laws against your carrying a firearm in a non-permissive
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.520]   environment, my guess would be that most of the time there aren't that many laws about
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:51.200]   your having a ballistic vest, a bulletproof vest so-called, a ballistic vest in your possession.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.280]   If I were a teacher and I were concerned about this, it wouldn't be that hard for me to find
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:01.080]   a place to put a simple bulletproof vest in a desk drawer.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.640]   And it would be relatively easy to, in a time of crisis, to grab a bulletproof vest and
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.640]   put it on.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.280]   Now, maybe you don't want to actually have the vest that may be a little bit over the
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.280]   top.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.160]   It's relatively easy, perhaps you can buy some soft armor, some soft plates, some soft
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.720]   ballistic plates and just slide them into a backpack.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.960]   And that could be something that could be easily worn.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.000]   You can get a standard backpack that has a laptop sleeve, go and purchase, you can get
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.480]   some hard plates if you have the physical strength to carry them.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.720]   But go online, purchase a couple of hard plates, maybe a couple of soft plates, slide them
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:44.080]   right into the backpack in a scenario where into the laptop sleeve or the rear pocket
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:50.760]   of a backpack and you've created a relatively effective ballistic shield for yourself.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:56.400]   And you can do it in a very low-key way where you don't have constant evidence of, you don't
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.440]   necessarily have a Kevlar helmet sitting there.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.200]   Most shooters are not very good shots.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.160]   And especially in an environment where you're dealing with an active shooter situation,
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.520]   there's a higher chance of randomness with the rounds that are going to be arriving at
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.720]   you than there is specifics.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:23.160]   Now if some guy's walking around a room delivering point-blank coup de grace shots to the head,
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.560]   in that situation, your backpack that you put on your, that you turn around and put
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.520]   on your chest is not going to do much for you.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.640]   But if you're dealing with a relatively random shooting and you're part of a crowd and you
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:42.040]   toss that thing on your back and you're fleeing from a shooter, I think you've got a pretty
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:47.640]   good case to say, "I've got some good ballistic protection on my vital organs."
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:52.160]   You can get shot in the butt as long as they don't get your, what's that, the big artery
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:56.040]   called the femoral artery.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.240]   You could survive those wounds.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.160]   And especially if you're dealing with something like a rifle round, a full metal jacket rifle
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.400]   round, it may just go right through your thigh and you may be able to run away and get there.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.920]   You can get shot and you can survive these things as long as you protect your vital organs.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.720]   So don't neglect personal protection.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.600]   Now I guess, I don't know how hardcore to go, you could go and purchase, if you have
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.360]   a closet or something, if you work in a high-risk environment, you could purchase some SWAT
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:26.840]   shield online, the type of thing that if you've ever seen the SWAT guys stack up to enter
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.440]   a house, the front guy always has a shield.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.760]   You can buy that thing for 700 bucks if you were that concerned about it.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.520]   But you take this concept and figure out what applies to you.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.520]   But the point is, protect yourself.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.160]   So one, don't be there.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.160]   Two, get away.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.680]   Three, hide, concealment.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.360]   Four, protect yourself, find cover.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.240]   Now five, of course, is fight back.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.940]   And what bugs me to no end is people diminish the value of fighting back.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:33:01.720]   Go and do some study for yourself on how frequently fights end when somebody fights back.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:08.400]   The majority of people, and this is at every level of society, I hate bullies.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.680]   I hate people who bully.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.480]   And one of the things that bullies often get used to is people not fighting back.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.800]   And a lot of the times, if you're dealing with a bully, whether this is the archetypal
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.040]   bully in the schoolyard, a punch to the nose will stop a bully.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.680]   It can also happen in the world of rhetoric and political debate.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.160]   A punch in the nose will sometimes, frequently, stop a bully.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.520]   But bullies get used to having their way and bullying other people into wanting what they
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.520]   do.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.800]   Well, same thing in a fight.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.760]   If you fight back, whether that's a fist fight or a bar fight or an active shooter, if you
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.280]   fight back, a lot of times it ends it.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:47.000]   In many active shootings, remember, don't take your advice or your input from one single
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   event.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.480]   But in many of these active shooter scenarios that make the news all the time, frequently,
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:01.440]   one person fighting back, whether that's one police officer, one armed citizen fighting
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:06.440]   back, frequently, that will initiate, that'll stop the attack.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.840]   Frequently, it seems that that will often make many shooters go ahead and commit suicide
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.560]   when somebody fights back.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.440]   But none of us who are not, none of us, I'm not in the military, never been in the military,
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.840]   don't want to be in the military, don't want to be a cop, don't want to deal with that.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.520]   But none of us are all that comfortable with bullets coming at us.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.820]   And what bugs me so much, I'm going to get a tiny bit of political in our current world.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:39.200]   What bugs me is people underestimate the value of a good defense.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:46.440]   The survivability, if you were to walk up and threaten me to say, "Joshua, I'm going
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:54.320]   to shoot you from five yards away, 15 feet away, across the room with a 22 pistol,"
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.200]   statistically that would be very survivable.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:03.000]   Statistically, very survivable, especially if it's not a hollow point bullet, it's
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.520]   just a full metal jacket bullet.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.960]   Statistically, that would be very survivable.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:12.280]   I still don't want to get shot with a 22, even though statistically the evidence is
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.280]   on my side.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.840]   I would still freak out if you're shooting at me.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.920]   And the same thing happens again and again and again with people who are active shooters.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:26.760]   Just fighting back, somebody taking rounds that are incoming will often melt down their
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.760]   defenses.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.040]   Now, of course, in this situation, fighting back, firearm options are very limited.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.440]   I'm talking here specifically about a non-permissive environment where you're not technically allowed
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.680]   to carry firearms.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.880]   I hate these environments, especially if they're not adequate security.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.440]   I'll talk about that in the show on the morality, the one that I have where I'll deal with
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.120]   the political stuff if you care about my political opinion.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:53.040]   But you will have to decide, I want to be clear, you have to decide if the risk to you,
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.440]   especially the legal risk of carrying a gun, is worth the reward of potentially protecting
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.760]   yourself and potentially saving lives.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:08.760]   I think it's immoral to take away from people their moral human right to self-defense if
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.040]   you're not guaranteeing them a very high standard of security.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.440]   And here's where we get into the problem.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:21.080]   It's a classic quote by Bastiat in his essay, The Law, where he talks about when you have
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.400]   to choose.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.000]   The quote is, "No society can exist unless the laws are respected to a certain degree,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.760]   but the safest way to make them respected is to make them respectable.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:35.000]   When law and morality are in contradiction to each other, the citizen finds himself in
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.720]   the cruel alternative of either losing his moral sense or of losing his respect for the
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:45.480]   law, two evils of equal magnitude between which it would be difficult to choose."
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.560]   And so when you're in a non-permissive environment like this, I ask you the question, does the
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:55.720]   person who has the legal control of the premises, whether that's a school administration, whether
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:01.360]   that's an employer, are they providing actual security or are they just saying, "You're
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.800]   not allowed to carry a gun"?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.240]   If they're providing actual security, then I think they have a moral case to say, "We're
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.200]   not going to allow you a gun."
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.000]   I'm okay with a federal courtroom being protected by metal detectors and with it being
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.160]   the federal court's jurisdiction, they're allowed to establish the law and say, "No,
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.220]   you may not carry a firearm here."
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.840]   But I'm not okay with a random business putting a sign on their door saying, "No,
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.160]   you can't carry a gun here."
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.400]   Meanwhile, anybody who wants to ignore that sign can carry it in.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:39.440]   If you're going to remove people's rights of self-defense, you then have the responsibility
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.120]   to provide for them a common defense.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.800]   Now if you're working in a non-permissive environment and you make the moral decision
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:55.120]   that you are going to reject the law because the law is immoral, you should be aware that
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.200]   deep concealment firearms options are not that difficult to accomplish.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.280]   You may have to be much more careful.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:07.320]   I would recommend that you not carry a .45 caliber 1911 and a shoulder holster, Miami
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.720]   Vice style, if you're in a non-permissive environment.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:16.720]   But it's relatively easy for both men and women to have deep concealment firearm options
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.400]   that will never be detected without professional scrutiny.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.340]   Men have certain advantages, women have certain advantages.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.720]   In some cases, men have it easier, in some cases, women have it easier.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:33.240]   But even a small gun will help in a situation where you're dealing with an active shooter.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:40.460]   A .22 caliber five-shot Derringer, the kind of gun that you could hold in the palm of
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.840]   your hand and never have it be seen, when that thing starts going off, you're going
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.640]   to have a tough time shooting it accurately, but when that thing starts going off, only
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:55.460]   a trained, skilled person, like a military person or like a police officer who has experience
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:00.260]   with dealing with incoming rounds, is not going to be thrown off balance.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.840]   And your active defense may save lives in a situation like that.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.640]   Now, it may not.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.720]   There are tactical situations that are impossible, but most of these situations are not tactically
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   impossible.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.040]   Even a small gun would help, it really would.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.480]   If you're in a situation where you're in a non-permissive environment and you've decided,
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.540]   "I can't take the legal risk of concealing it on my person," consider, is there a place
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.520]   that you could hide it in your belongings, in your possessions, or in the room?
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:34.800]   There may be a way for you to secure a firearm in a way that is a good compromise between
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:42.400]   the legality and your need to protect yourself legally in case you were caught with that
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.600]   versus the practical access to self-defense.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.560]   I don't know how to help you make that decision.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.080]   I hate these places.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:55.020]   I hate them, and I usually stay out of them because I believe that it's immoral to say
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.140]   to somebody, "You cannot provide for your defense, but we're not going to provide a
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.140]   solid common defense."
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.220]   That is an immoral thing.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:10.420]   So either you provide a secure stalwart common defense, "All right, if the Secret Service
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:15.340]   is guarding the President, I'm not trying to get a gun in there, but I'm appreciating
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:20.300]   the fact that I can trust the Secret Service, but a sign on the door or a corporate policy
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.340]   is not a common defense."
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:26.320]   Anyway, forgive me, I'm trying to avoid the politics.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:32.700]   But even if you were a teacher, there's a big debate about teachers, so I don't want
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.020]   to fight that debate.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:41.740]   Let me be precise and honest with my words.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.620]   I want to fight that debate.
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:49.500]   I don't want to abuse you in this show by an extensive discourse on it, but I'll make
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.380]   two comments.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.780]   It hangers me to no end that people think teachers are weak.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.820]   Now I think that teachers, many of them are weak, and that's the problem.
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:05.740]   So either get rid of the weak teachers or stop insulting people.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.420]   Of course, the majority of teachers are women.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:13.380]   And of course, with this intense feminization of this feminine trait and this desire to
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:19.020]   not self-defense, not to defend, this desire to run from a fight, that's what needs to
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.020]   be conquered.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.020]   That needs to be changed.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:26.780]   But there's no inherent biological characteristic why a woman cannot be a crack shot.
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:33.660]   If I were a teacher and the law permitted it, I'd have a locker in...
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:38.900]   If school shootings were actually statistically relevant, I'd have a secure locker in the
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.620]   room, a locked up safe.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:47.900]   I'd have a small backpack with a short barreled AR-15 with a red dot sight.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:52.660]   I'd have a bulletproof vest hanging there, hearing protection to slap on and ballistic
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:56.080]   eye protection, a trauma kit ready to go.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.220]   You give me five seconds to cross the room, put the code in the safe, grab a short barreled
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:08.780]   AR and put on a vest and some hearing protection, and trust me, that's not that hard to do.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.340]   There's no need to think by arming a teacher, there's no need to think that you need to
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:16.580]   walk around with a desert eagle strapped to your hip all the time.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.940]   You're not dealing with that kind of scenario necessarily.
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.880]   It's not the Wild West where it's about a quick draw contest.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:31.060]   A teacher could absolutely have a locker in their room and you give me any woman, any
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:37.580]   teacher, any female teacher, give some qualified firearms trainer a half a day of instruction
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:45.820]   and a rifle and you could turn any teacher into a very skilled, perfectly adequately
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.140]   skilled defender of her classroom.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.060]   You absolutely could, especially if you give her a rifle and not a handgun.
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:43:00.060]   It's much harder to learn to accurately shoot a handgun, but you give her a short barreled
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.060]   AR-15.
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.260]   Anyway, thank you for indulging my political comment.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.100]   That's it for firearm options for today.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:12.140]   So if you think about an ability, a way for you to fight back with a firearm, that's fine.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.420]   But let's assume for a moment that you're in a non-permissive environment, you can't
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:19.540]   carry a gun or you've decided that you won't carry a gun or you've decided what are you
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.540]   going to do?
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.740]   Well, a few options.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.460]   Distraction and I've got these in two categories.
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.800]   First category is distraction devices.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.180]   So consider some form of distraction device.
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:36.700]   The most, none of these are particularly practical, but the most practical one would be a light.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:42.940]   A powerful high lumen tactical flashlight is a powerful distraction device.
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:47.260]   For your own personal self-defense, if you're out in the night, you should have with you
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:54.860]   a high lumen flashlight and many of these flashlights are really good at having settings,
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.020]   different settings that can be low, medium, high.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.420]   If you're in a situation where you think you might need it, you need that distraction device.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.660]   Get that light, have that light preset on its highest lumen setting and you can blind
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:09.900]   somebody in a dark environment with a good flashlight.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.380]   And that's simple.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.380]   Everybody could have a flashlight.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.540]   You could have a small one, you can have a big one.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:20.820]   The market has never been better with inexpensive, high quality, high lumen flashlights.
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:26.500]   There has been a revolution in light technology over the last five years, especially with
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:31.500]   newer battery styles that produce a much higher output than was possible before.
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:36.460]   And these new battery styles have given flashlight manufacturers the ability to massively amp
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:37.780]   up the lumens.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.980]   If you have a, if your flashlight is from 10 years ago and you haven't looked at a new
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:45.500]   flashlight, you would be embarrassed to ever pull out your 10 year old flashlight and try
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.580]   to put it in a competition against a new one.
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:45:00.580]   I carry every day a tiny little flashlight, blanking, it's the 47's Mini Mark II.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.620]   It's a tiny little flashlight.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:06.340]   It's smaller than my thumb, but the lumen output on this, if I put it on a turbo mode,
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.340]   is massive.
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.940]   It'll light up a neighborhood.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:09.940]   It's incredible.
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.500]   And it was cheap, it's 40 bucks, I've mentioned on the show before.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.300]   But having a good flashlight would be valuable.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:20.540]   If I were a teacher and I were thinking, "How am I going to protect my room?"
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.760]   I would consider having a few flashlights in there.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.140]   If you, it's hard if you've got first graders, but if you're dealing with a class full of
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:32.500]   juniors, if you had a bag or a drawer with three or four flashlights in it, that might
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.380]   give you the ability to distract somebody who's coming into the door with a gun.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:40.300]   I think the protocol that is usually taught is lights off, everybody quiet, everybody
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.060]   in the back of the room hiding somehow.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.380]   Well, at least distribute some flashlights, you may have the ability to distract somebody.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:51.820]   In some cases, another good distraction device to have handy is an alarm, like a loud horn
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.420]   or a siren.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:57.500]   One of the best self-defense items that you can have is a loud horn.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:02.920]   Go to, you get a Home Depot or wherever, buy one of these horns, the loud air horns that
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.340]   are used in the boating industry.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.580]   Buy one of the loud ones.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:11.860]   They're easily sold, they're very inexpensive, but a loud horn is a very, very valuable self-defense
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:12.860]   item.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.580]   If you are being attacked in a parking lot, as you walk across the parking lot, if you're
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:22.140]   being attacked in your house, if you are a college student or your son or daughter is
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:27.740]   a college student, make sure they have access to a loud boat horn and the ability to use
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:28.740]   it.
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:33.380]   In that way, if your daughter is being raped, have a horn there, so instead of just yelling
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:36.140]   and screaming, that she can actually get some attention.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.020]   Another example would be a siren.
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:43.300]   These are simple things that there's no physical danger like there is with firearms or bladed
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:49.100]   weapons, but they're very powerful distraction devices.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:54.620]   I thought through the scenario, if I have a classroom of 10th graders, I think a couple
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:59.060]   of horns and some lights would be very helpful distraction devices.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.700]   Those are distraction devices.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.700]   You may have your own.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.220]   Next would be hitting instruments, some kind of instrument that could be used for hitting
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.500]   and hitting effectively.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.580]   Obvious examples would be a baseball bat.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:14.700]   A baseball bat is something that any teacher could have in their classroom, and yet in
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:20.900]   a time of need, that baseball bat is kind of a big deal.
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.300]   So a hitting instrument like a baseball bat is important.
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:29.740]   I'm thinking here, chuckling, because it just came to me, there's a scene in the old Laura
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.140]   Ingalls Wilder books.
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:34.300]   I forget which one.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:39.260]   Actually it was Farmer Boy and the one of Almanzo.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:46.580]   In that situation, it was a one-room schoolhouse scene and there was this young, bookish, dweeby
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:53.300]   teacher that was hired on as a new teacher in the one-room schoolhouse.
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:56.860]   Of course, he was bookish and physically weak.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:01.580]   So the students who were the bullies of the school were going to be lined up to – and
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.060]   they decided this was the day that they were going to put the teacher down.
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.660]   They were going to fight the teacher.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:09.620]   Well the day came that they were going to fight the teacher and that teacher hid in
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.620]   his teacher desk.
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:15.300]   When the big bullies of the school came up the aisle to fight the teacher, he had in
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:20.580]   his teacher desk a bullwhip, pulled out the bullwhip and went to town on those boys and
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.180]   sent them on their heels.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:26.380]   He solved the problem, got the kids out of there, but it was through the use of a tool.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.260]   If you're a teacher, if you're someone like that, you have to have the same thing.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.060]   You've got to have the tool.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:37.140]   If you are a relatively non-physically imposing woman, you're going to need some kind of
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.620]   instrument that will help you with your physical strength.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:44.180]   Because if you're going up against a guy coming in the door with an AR-15, you need
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:50.620]   something a little bit more than saying, "Please, politely, please don't kill me."
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.160]   A baseball bat will go a long way, a hitting instrument.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:58.580]   Other instruments, something like a walking cane or a stick, a collapsible baton, the
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.300]   style of law enforcement.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.420]   I don't want to get hit with a baton.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:03.820]   They're powerful, short little things.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:09.500]   You keep it in your desk drawer, whack that thing open and you've got an effective tool.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.600]   If you've got a – depending on your type of environment, maybe it's a wrench.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:19.160]   If you work in an environment where it's appropriate, keep a tire iron handy and make
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.960]   sure that it's easily accessible to protect yourself.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.060]   There are all kinds of ideas.
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:27.500]   A big old mag light, the old style of police style flashlight, a big old mag light is a
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.080]   very effective weapon.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.420]   But all of these hitting instruments can be helpful.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:40.900]   Now, what bugs me about the conversation is people often immediately take the role of
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.620]   victim and that's what angers me about this.
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:48.100]   People take the role of victim and say, "Well, you just can't do anything against a dude
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.100]   with a rifle."
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.680]   Want to bet?
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.940]   You can absolutely do something against a dude with a rifle.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.060]   Now, if you've got a dude with a rifle that's on the other side of a football field and
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:01.260]   you're coming across a hundred yards of empty ground and there's only one of you,
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:06.100]   there's not a chance in the world that you're going to make it across that football field
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.380]   alive.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:12.260]   But if you've got a guy coming in the door of your room and you've got a couple of
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.880]   flashlights, a loud horn, you've got a baseball bat that you handed out, two of them, walking
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.660]   cane, you've got a bunch of people, you blocked the door, you can absolutely get on
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.700]   it with a guy with a rifle.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:27.180]   You may lose a couple of people in the process, but you're going to lose them anyway.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:33.100]   If a dozen students rush the guy with a rifle, three or four of them may go down, but that's
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.140]   better than 10 of them going down and the other ones will actually get there and get
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.820]   the rifle out of his hands.
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.580]   Great thing about a rifle is it shoots really well.
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:40.740]   It's easy to shoot.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.340]   Hard thing about a rifle, it's very hard to use in close quarters, especially if somebody
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.540]   can get it and it's much easier for somebody to control the barrel of a rifle than it
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.340]   is control the barrel of a handgun.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:55.080]   So think about having hitting instruments available to you and position some of those
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.200]   weapons in a way that is available to you.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.940]   Throwing instruments as well.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:01.940]   Things that can be thrown.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.540]   An example here would be a baseball.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.800]   Now talk about plausible deniability.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:13.900]   If I were trying to protect a workplace or if I were a teacher, I would go down to the
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:20.140]   sporting goods, I would, who am I kidding, I would ask around to get for free somebody
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.660]   who has an old baseball bat bag.
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:27.260]   I would get the baseball bat bag and I would load it up with three or four old bats.
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:31.220]   I would get with the metal ones so they can really deliver some damage.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.540]   I load it up with some bats and I'd load it up with baseballs and toss a couple of old
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:36.140]   gloves in there as well.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:42.460]   Now we've got baseball equipment, but what you actually have is very useful hitting instruments,
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:47.980]   a couple of baseball bats, and if I'm hiding in a classroom with a group of junior economics
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:52.020]   students, you better believe every one of the biggest guys in the room, the toughest
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.180]   guys, I'm going to give every one of them a baseball and I'm going to toss out that
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:59.540]   sack of, excuse me, I'm going to give them the bats and I'm going to toss that sack of
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:04.060]   baseballs out and I'm going to give every single student in there a baseball and give
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.140]   as many as I can.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:07.140]   You think that's stupid?
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.980]   I don't, maybe it is.
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:13.260]   If you have experience in this, maybe, I made up this entire show off the top of my head
[00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:14.820]   so this is just how I think about it.
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:18.420]   I didn't read all the people who actually paid to do this for a living.
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:22.500]   But I'm not going to be a victim and I'm going to make sure that that teacher is not a victim
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.500]   and those kids are not victims.
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:28.000]   And we're not going to hide in the corner and get shot cowering in the corner.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.540]   We're going to fight back.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:36.380]   So some guy pokes a barrel of a rifle in our classroom and I've got four of my big junior
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:40.060]   students all have big metal baseball bats and they're positioned near the door on either
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:41.060]   side.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.060]   You can't shoot them both the same way.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:44.580]   This is not a SWAT team coming in where they're coming in stacked.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:48.540]   You got one guy going left, one guy going right and even if it were, a room full of
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.740]   junior students would put a hurt on a SWAT team.
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:55.340]   And I've got everyone else with baseballs saying if you see something, come through and
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:59.200]   I'm standing there with a horn saying if you hear my horn, everybody go.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.820]   And the guy pokes the barrel of a rifle through and there's flashlights going off, there's
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.580]   baseballs getting pelted at him and there's a couple of guys with bats that are beating
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.300]   him and there's a horn going off.
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:15.460]   I'm sorry, but you better be a battle-hardened special forces soldier to be able to keep
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:19.780]   any decent shooting with that.
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:23.460]   So throwing instruments and this can be all kinds of things.
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:27.740]   A bundle of keys in some environments can be important.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:33.740]   A sack of baseballs, a padlock, find things that are compact, that are heavy and that
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.860]   will do some damage.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:43.580]   Example, a big old hockey puck lock, you know, the kind they put on the trailers, the ones
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:49.580]   that look like a puck, you got a couple of those in a drawer somewhere, that's a totally
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.100]   innocuous thing.
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:57.940]   And talk about a hurting throwing weapon, I don't want to get hit in the face with a
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:01.860]   hockey puck lock from a landscaping trailer.
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:05.440]   So look around your house, look around your office, look around a store and try to think,
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.460]   what are things that can be thrown?
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.780]   Next category is flailing instruments.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:16.980]   A flailing instrument is a classic example of a self-defense weapon and there are all
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:21.860]   kinds of ways that you can do this and do it innocuously.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:29.460]   A bike chain with a couple of heavy padlocks on the end is a formidable flailing weapon.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.060]   And by chain you need a very flexible chain, so you need something that is either fabric
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.700]   rope or flexible chain.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:41.220]   But a flexible bike chain with a couple of padlocks on it is a formidable weapon in a
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.540]   close quarters battle.
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:49.420]   A padlock, a big heavy padlock stuck down on the end of an athletic tube sock, this
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:54.020]   creates a powerful flailing weapon, almost equivalent to a SAP, a leather SAP.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:58.060]   Or a sock with a handful of big D cell battery stuff down on the bottom.
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:01.460]   If you're in a, I don't think that would work, if you got a guy coming at you across down
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:05.600]   the end of a hallway with an AR-15, you got to get there of course, get close to him.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:10.500]   But if you're in a close quarter combat scenario, then a flailing weapon can be helpful.
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:15.220]   Another example would be you could put together a big heavy key ring and put a long strong
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.580]   lanyard on the end.
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:17.980]   You take that and swing it around.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:23.220]   There's a weapon from the world of martial arts called a monkey fist, same thing.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.540]   And there are all kinds of options of these if you go looking.
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.060]   And if you're in a non-permissive environment, you should look.
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:31.660]   There are people that you can get just get a heavy leather belt or not too heavy because
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:32.660]   you want the belt to be flexible.
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:38.520]   But get a fabric belt or a light flexible leather belt, but put a big heavy belt buckle
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.520]   on it.
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:43.140]   There are people that sell online big heavy metal belt buckles.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.020]   If you need a flailing instrument, you have a belt and there are techniques that can be
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.020]   used.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:56.820]   People sell things called a SAP cap, which is a baseball cap that has lead shots sewn
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:57.820]   into it.
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:01.820]   So if you need to use it as a defense weapon, you take the cap off your head and whack somebody
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:05.060]   and that lead shot is a brutal impact weapon.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:10.260]   It's a flailing weapon, but it'll do some damage in a close quarter environment.
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:16.200]   Now some of those, forgive me for getting a little bit off, that's not applicable necessarily
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:21.160]   to the school shooting environment, but I want to inspire and stimulate your thinking
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:26.340]   so that you can look around where you are and say, "How can I not be a helpless victim?"
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.800]   Next example would be poking instruments.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:34.720]   So things like an umbrella, whether that's just a standard umbrella, a cheap one from
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:38.840]   the dollar store, whether that's a good golf umbrella that you get that has a little bit
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:44.120]   more heft, or you can actually buy about 80 bucks, you can buy an expensive and fancy
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.080]   self-defense umbrella that is, the thing is rock solid.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.080]   It's really well built.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   You can stand on it.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   It won't break.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.180]   It's designed for poking.
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:57.560]   It's designed for popping the umbrella open and using it to protect yourself against physical
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.560]   blows.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.960]   It won't do anything against bullets, of course, but somebody who's attacking you physically
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:07.080]   can be used as a club, but an umbrella is a very useful tool, or a broomstick, or a
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:11.580]   mop handle, those kinds of things, poking instruments, or a lacrosse stick, something
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:15.040]   that could be useful in your place of business.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:20.880]   You interpret that however you need, but don't think that, you know, a lot of people have
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.520]   been killed with shovels.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:28.960]   A good shovel or a good mop handle will give you some good defensive capability against
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.240]   somebody who's attacking you.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:35.400]   Not so useful against a gun unless you're in close range, but a lot of times if you're
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:41.720]   in a scenario where, if you're in a close quarter combat place, the guns, especially
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:47.760]   a long rifle, a rifle's capabilities are significantly diminished in a close environment.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:54.680]   A handgun in many ways is a more effective weapon because the person with the weapon
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.920]   can actually control it in a close quarter combat environment.
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:05.440]   That's why most of the time if you have a SWAT team or some other military team that's
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:10.080]   dealing in a known close quarter environment, they'll usually use a submachine gun, a much
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:14.160]   smaller submachine gun versus a rifle.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:18.920]   If you're going up against an AR-15, some guy has a standard long barrel on it, it's
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:22.480]   not a short barreled rifle, just a standard long barrel on it, that's unwieldy when he
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.000]   starts going around corners, so all these things can make a difference.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.160]   Next category is slashing or stabbing instruments.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.480]   Obvious examples would be scissors.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:37.240]   I have a pair of scissors that I grabbed from my grandfather's desk before he died, and
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:42.320]   it's awesome, it's old, but it's just pure metal and the things are huge.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:46.400]   As far as a stabbing weapon to protect yourself, to keep in your desk drawer, I use them for
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.680]   cutting, but there also would be an extremely effective stabbing weapon.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.960]   They're not safety scissors at all.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:56.360]   So there's no reason why you couldn't have enough plausible deniability with having a
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:00.160]   decent pair of scissors or a letter opener or a knife.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:05.480]   Whatever the rules are that you decide to follow, I think it's very important to consider
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:13.160]   carefully what the rules are and then consider what the penalty is for breaking those rules.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:19.640]   You might find it much easier to conceal a large knife in your work environment, and
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:26.840]   the legal penalties for concealing that large knife may be less than the difficulty of concealing
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.920]   a handgun or the legal penalties for concealing a handgun if you work in a non-permissive
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.040]   environment.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:36.400]   So consider what options would fit in your work environment.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.840]   Next, and these are not appropriate for school defense, but I want to emphasize them in case
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:49.040]   you live in some place where you're legally not permitted to buy a gun or you're 15 years
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:54.800]   old and people don't think you should have a gun, what can you have to protect yourself?
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.680]   One of the most effective things for home defense, I'm convinced, is either a spear
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.880]   or a sword.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:04.800]   I think the weight is actually on the spear.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:10.400]   If you think about a scenario, let's say that you're a young man or a young woman living
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.880]   in something like a college dorm.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:17.160]   This is a non-permissive environment for multiple reasons.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.200]   One, you have very little privacy of your things.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:25.240]   So two, you're on a school campus, which most of the time you're not allowed to carry a
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.160]   gun even if you own one.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:32.080]   Three, you may be under the age of acquisition where you can't buy a gun legally and you
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.160]   don't have anybody that would lend one to you or you don't want to get involved in that.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.160]   You can't protect it.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.040]   If you own a gun, you have a responsibility to protect it.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.880]   So you've got to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands and make sure that it's
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.760]   not stolen from you and used to commit crime by somebody else.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:50.440]   And in considering those scenarios, I would do that calculation and it's hard for me to
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:55.280]   imagine that I would have a gun if I were in a college dorm.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:03.340]   But it may be much more reasonable for me to have a spear.
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:08.480]   For example, Cold Steel is a well-known knife manufacturer.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.640]   Make excellent quality products.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.280]   But they sell these spears that are used for different purposes.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.360]   Some of them are just cool.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.600]   Some of them are hunting, etc.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:25.980]   But you could take the spear off of its shaft, keep the shaft leaning up in the closet, conceal
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:29.560]   and secure the actual spear.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.960]   It would be a large bladed weapon.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.640]   Check whatever rules or regulations you're subject to.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.440]   But in your own home, that would be a very effective weapon.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.220]   Now if somebody is seeking to attack you in the confines of your own home, somebody's
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:48.720]   beating the door down, a spear is very intimidating and is brutal in terms of its actual physical
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.080]   effect on an attacker.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.800]   If my daughter were in a situation like that, you better believe I want her to have a spear
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800]   handy.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:59.640]   Now I've never heard somebody talk about, "Oh, you should have a spear," necessarily
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.640]   a spear.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.980]   That's not common discussion.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:07.620]   But it's a whole lot more effective than having just a cell phone, right?
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:13.480]   Having something, if some drunk frat boy is trying to beat down her door, that'll put
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.560]   a little bit of intimidation in her and help to level the playing field.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.560]   Sword as well.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:24.040]   A sword is one of those things that may be regulated, but when you're dealing with regulations,
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.080]   recognize that if you're looking at the laws of your city, you live in a place like New
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:32.560]   York City or San Francisco or Rome, look at the laws and ask yourself, are these laws
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:38.080]   based upon concealment or are they based upon possession?
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.620]   Many times there may be a knife law that says you're not allowed to have a weapon that's
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:46.640]   over a certain number of inches, say it's four inches.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.000]   On that situation, I don't see any reason to take the risk for you to walk around with
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.040]   a five-inch knife.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.080]   Just get yourself a good, well-built four-inch knife, a folding knife, to carry with you
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.880]   as a protection weapon when you're concealing it on your body.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.280]   But that doesn't apply to your home.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:09.120]   There's no reason why you can't legally have a big old cold steel samurai sword in your
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.320]   home.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.200]   There was, I forget the timeline on this, but there was a news story of a college student
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:20.420]   up in Tallahassee, I think it was FSU student, who protected his home, was broken into by
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:24.200]   I think a couple of assailants during the middle of the day, protected himself with
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.200]   a spear.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.200]   He won.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.320]   Sorry, not a spear, a sword, a samurai sword.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.320]   He won.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.320]   The guy with the sword won.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.440]   The person who was being attacked, the guy who was defending his house.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.720]   So those are not appropriate for schools.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:42.720]   I can't imagine how, I don't think that's a practical solution for a school.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:49.840]   But if you are young, if you are in a place where you don't have the ability to arm yourself,
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:55.640]   you can't defend yourself effectively with a gun, you've chosen not to defend yourself
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.360]   with a gun for whatever reason, then don't think that you're defenseless.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:06.380]   Think ahead and acquire the equipment that you need to make a good defense.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.300]   Next would be projectile instruments.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.880]   So we've covered distraction devices, hitting instruments, throwing instruments, flailing
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.720]   instruments, poking instruments, stabbing or slashing instruments, the final three,
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.060]   projectile instruments.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:22.400]   So simple things here would be something like a slingshot.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.560]   A slingshot, a modern slingshot.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.240]   There are variations of it, but people have taken the old technology, the things that
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.440]   I made when I was a kid, you go out and find a fork tree and make rubber bands, and they've
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:41.480]   become very, very accurate devices that can deliver a steel shot at a very high velocity.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:49.120]   I'd rather, if I'm going up against a guy with a gun, if I've got cover and we're not
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.640]   in, when we're in an environment where this person is, they're filled with adrenaline,
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.240]   they're not looking for threats, they're in a target rich environment shooting unarmed
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.520]   people.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:04.280]   If I can get behind cover and I can have access to a slingshot at relatively close distances,
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:10.800]   there's a good chance that I can deliver enough annoying shot to them, one or two that would
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.400]   actually hit to perhaps at least slow them down and save some lives.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.800]   It's hard for me to imagine, I haven't read the laws in your school, but it's hard for
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:25.560]   me to imagine that your school has said, "Well, teachers can't have a slingshot."
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:32.840]   Or in other circumstances where perhaps you're, we're not talking about school defense here,
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:37.600]   but you're dealing in an area where you have very restrictive gun laws.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:43.920]   There's so many ways to get around these draconian gun laws that are enacted in some places,
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.560]   but some simple things would be an air rifle.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:53.400]   Basically an air rifle is relatively, you're able to acquire it and depending on how the
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:58.360]   law is written, if you read it, you may be able to acquire a high velocity air rifle.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.520]   If you go out and do some careful shopping, you may find a high velocity air rifle or
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:12.680]   a high velocity handgun rifle, air pistol that would be an effective deterrent.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:15.720]   The same way that I don't want to get shot with a .22, I don't want to get shot with
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:19.400]   an air rifle, especially a high velocity one.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.880]   I don't want to get shot, period.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:27.160]   I don't want to get hit with a slingshot, a steel ball coming at me at a very high velocity.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.440]   I don't want to get hit with that.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.400]   These things are enough to deter, in some situations, these things are enough of a deterrent
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.380]   to be helpful in certain circumstances.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:41.440]   Other obvious examples would be things like crossbows, less effective for defense because
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:46.520]   they're too slow to actually use, I'd rather have a slingshot and a bag of shot than probably
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.200]   in some situations than a crossbow.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:55.240]   But if I had a crossbow that was ready to go, had an arrow knocked and was ready to
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:00.120]   use accompanied by a slingshot, now you can get into some effective defense if you live
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:07.200]   in a place, a country or a city or in a non-permissive environment that is going to be very problematic
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.200]   for you.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.880]   So projectile instruments have their place.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.320]   While we're on the subject of...
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.560]   I'll do that in a minute.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.480]   Next category would be sprays and irritants.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.660]   Big one here is pepper spray.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:24.560]   Pepper spray, and especially if you are in a school environment or if you're in a home
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:28.440]   environment, then you may purchase pepper spray that would be different than what you
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.920]   can carry on your person.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:37.120]   In my opinion, every single person, especially every single person who carries a firearm
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.960]   should also carry pepper spray.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:46.000]   I think it's irresponsible not to have a less lethal means of defense, to only have a gun
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.440]   as your only option.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.640]   I think you need to carry pepper spray.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:53.040]   But with pepper spray, there's a difference between what you may be able to carry in your
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.160]   pocket versus what you may be able to have in your home.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.280]   And when you actually look at pepper spray, and if you're willing to do the research and
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.880]   spend some money, there's a big difference in different applications.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.800]   There are cloud forms of pepper spray that will give you...
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.740]   If someone was a close-up attacker, it'll just fill the air with a choking cloud.
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:17.880]   But then there are also more streaming forms of pepper spray where you could effectively
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.920]   dissuade or deter somebody at say 10 feet away.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.320]   So if you shop carefully, you may look around, and if this is for your home or for your dorm
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:34.600]   room or for your classroom, I would be inclined to make some selections of a large canister
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:39.480]   of something that has some good velocity, the ability to go out 10 feet or 15 feet,
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:43.120]   because you don't have the constraint of how do I conceal this thing in my pocket.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:51.480]   A big old canister of commercial law enforcement grade pepper spray will be a much more effective
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:58.640]   deterrent than a small little, goes on my key chain, canister of pepper spray.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:03.680]   So think about that and then shop appropriately for the scenario.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.920]   There's such an important nuance when you're thinking through what type of weapon would
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.000]   I choose in a certain environment, because there's always a balance.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.560]   There's always a trade-off.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:18.480]   If you knew you were going to go and get in a gunfight today, if you knew that, man, I'd
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.360]   be in there with an AR-10.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.400]   I'd have a bulletproof vest.
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.200]   I'd have a half a dozen 40-round magazines ready to go.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.480]   I'm sorry, that makes 40s with a .308.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.120]   I'd be in there with a long-distance rifle.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.120]   I'd have a handgun strapped to my side.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.240]   If I knew I was going to get in a gunfight, I'd have a ballistic helmet on.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.640]   I'd do everything I could.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.280]   But the thing is, of course, you don't know you're going to get in a gunfight.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.320]   When we're dealing with a school shooting, we're dealing with a statistical anomaly
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:53.240]   that has a risk of happening that is so close to zero that most people can go through their
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.600]   entire life and never think about preparing for it.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.240]   That's the reality of it.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.640]   And so I think it would be a little silly to do over-the-top preparation for something
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.080]   that's very statistically unlikely to happen.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.020]   We always have this trade-off is the point.
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:10.760]   You don't go around with an M1 Garand strapped to your back on a daily basis unless you're
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.820]   in a war zone, and most of us are not.
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:18.040]   So you make trade-offs, and the same thing with things like sprays and irritants.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.920]   Another example would be something like a fire extinguisher in terms of what you could
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.720]   have available to you.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:29.600]   A fire extinguisher could be a very effective and useful tool for self-defense.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.800]   Number one, if you had a large fire extinguisher that put out a significant stream, now you
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:40.600]   have the ability to distract and to deter or at least throw their aim off somebody who's
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.680]   coming at you, an attacker.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:47.960]   It wouldn't be unusual to have a large fire extinguisher that could put a stream of irritating
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:53.560]   vapors 10 feet away, 15 feet away.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:57.240]   That's too far away for you to be effective with your pocket knife.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:01.680]   You're up against a guy with a rifle who's coming around the corner 15 feet away from
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.320]   your desk.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.660]   Your little pocket knife doesn't do you very much good.
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.700]   You're going to get shot before you can reach him.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:17.280]   But if you can distract him enough with using a fire extinguisher, he comes around the corner
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.840]   enough for you to send your co-worker across to stab him in the neck, now all of a sudden
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.520]   you have the ability to protect yourself.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.920]   So think about that in advance.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.200]   Notice where are the fire extinguishers if you're a teacher, or perhaps you want to go
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:35.200]   ahead and have your own fire extinguisher that's underneath your desk or in the corner
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.200]   of your office.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.900]   How are you going to get into trouble for having an extra fire extinguisher in your
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.220]   office or in your desk drawer?
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:46.380]   Could even be valuable part of your fire safety plan.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:50.180]   Other things that could be useful in different contexts, things like road flares could be
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.900]   formidable weapons if you had a moment to strike it up.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.940]   There are contexts in which something like that seems fairly innocuous, but is a valuable
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:58.940]   self-defense item.
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:03.180]   A little hard to explain road flares if you're a teacher in a classroom, but for somebody
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:09.500]   else who needs a valuable self-defense item, but is in a non-permissive environment, that
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.460]   could be very helpful.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.840]   Last couple of options, tasers.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.740]   So this would be a whole discussion in and of itself, but the police style taser where
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:23.740]   it actually shoots a dart that has an electrical wire that's attached to the gun, you can buy
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.940]   those yourself commercially.
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:29.060]   How effective they are for self-defense, you be the judge.
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:31.980]   Whether you want to spend the money, whether that's useful, you be the judge.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:37.180]   But in terms of the laws regulating the possession of a taser versus the laws regulating the
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:40.500]   possession of a firearm, there'd be a big difference there.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:44.660]   And of course, there are other tasers that are the up-close contact devices.
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:49.620]   I don't think those do you any good in the type of environment we're talking about here,
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:54.100]   but perhaps in your home as far as protecting your apartment or your dorm room or having
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:58.180]   one by your bed might be a valuable protective device.
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:01.780]   Finally, I think there is a place, although this would be extremely dangerous, I think
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.020]   there's a place for fear devices.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:09.580]   Here I'm just thinking of the point of intimidation, something like an airsoft gun or something
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:15.140]   like one of the other workarounds, by the way, if you live in a place with draconian
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:20.340]   gun laws, like a big city or something like that, one of the things is to get an old antique
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.540]   firearm.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:27.580]   And so if you have an antique firearm, a pre-1898 firearm, even if it's just a big old shotgun,
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:31.300]   that can produce enough fear in somebody that no, you're not going to fight off somebody
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:36.700]   who's committing a determined attack against you with six guys with submachine guns who
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.000]   are invading your apartment.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.460]   But in terms of putting the fear in one person, some drunk is trying to get in the door and
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:48.780]   steal your drugs or whatever that type of situation, you can possess an antique firearm
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.340]   and it'll do what you need it to do.
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:56.260]   And it doesn't necessarily have to be a black powder, ball and powder type design.
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:00.820]   Although there are plenty of good modern black powder weapons that will come in under the
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:04.580]   exceptions for black powder weapons that would also be very intimidating.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.580]   But in terms of a fear device, another fear device would be something like an airsoft
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:08.580]   gun.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:13.340]   There are times at which I could imagine, because you can buy an airsoft gun that looks
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:18.460]   relatively similar to some other type of submachine gun, they have them in replicas.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:23.760]   There are times in which I can imagine that being a useful deterrent to somebody in terms
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.740]   of an intimidating threat.
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:30.460]   Remember this, when it comes to the actual firearm statistics as far as gunfights, number
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:34.860]   one, most people who defend their life with a firearm don't pull the trigger.
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:37.980]   It's important to note that.
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:39.660]   But you don't hear those stories.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:44.320]   That's the problem with the way that firearms usage in the United States is reported.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.740]   You hear stories about the very few big shootings constantly, but you don't hear stories all
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:55.620]   over the nation every day about the fights that are diffused by the presence of a firearm
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.420]   or the fights that are not started by the knowledge of a firearm present.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:06.180]   And so frequently a fight is stopped or an attacker is stopped by simply brandishing
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.620]   a firearm at somebody.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:12.980]   And in some cases, perhaps if you have an airsoft gun, that may be enough of a fear
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:18.580]   device that it could save your life in terms of your ability to brandish it at an attacker
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.140]   and put a little bit of fear in them.
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:23.820]   Even if you had to use it and pull the trigger, a bunch of airsoft pellets coming at my face
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:27.580]   from somebody who's a good shot and I'm not wearing goggles, I'm going to turn around
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:28.580]   and run.
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:34.380]   Now, be careful because one of the major dangers of things like airsoft guns is they can be
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:39.420]   mistaken, especially by law enforcement for a legitimate real firearm.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:45.980]   And so now we run the wrong risk where a 10-year-old kid brandishes an airsoft gun and a police
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:48.740]   officer mistakes it as a real firearm.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.260]   It's a real danger.
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.580]   So be very circumspect in how you would apply it.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:57.740]   But I think a fear device like an airsoft gun could be an effective deterrent of some
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.580]   crime.
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:04.660]   Those would be many methods of active self-defense, ways for you to fight back.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.420]   The key thing I want you to remember is this.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:12.460]   Most people who attack are not used to defense.
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:16.500]   Now most people aren't used to defending themselves, but most people who attack are not used to
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.500]   defense.
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:26.820]   And consequently, a vigorous defense, a vigorous active fighting back will often deter an attacker.
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.820]   Not always.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:28.820]   There's no guarantee of that.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:32.460]   You can find plenty of evidence for fights that are not deterred.
[01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.820]   But what do you have to lose?
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:45.740]   That's why Flight 93 and 9/11 I think changed probably forever the idea of hijacking an
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:52.180]   airplane because up until Flight 93 and up until 9/11, frequently the passengers on an
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:57.180]   airplane would have gone along with the demands of the hijacker.
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.860]   They would have been passive.
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:02.220]   They would have sat still and complied with all the demands knowing we're going to land
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:03.220]   somewhere.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.220]   There's going to be a hostage negotiation.
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.220]   We're going to be rescued.
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.780]   I think 9/11 changed all that.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:12.980]   It's hard for me to imagine, at least an American airliner, and I would assume it's probably
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:17.540]   globally, but it's hard for me to imagine an American airliner that were hijacked by
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:22.780]   terrorists where basically all the passengers didn't fight back or at least didn't move
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:25.240]   in that direction.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:32.260]   You put three people or four hijackers up against a plane load of angry people, yes,
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.380]   the guns will kill some people.
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:37.540]   But at the end of the day, the three or four against the plane load of angry people are
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.260]   going to lose.
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.940]   Now they may drive it into the ground.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:43.060]   That's a problem.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:46.980]   But even in some of these active shooter environments, about the only one that was tactically impossible
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:47.980]   was Las Vegas.
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:53.040]   The details on that are still so unclear as we wait for the official reports.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:57.720]   But that was the only one that I've looked at that was basically tactically impossible.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:02.220]   I wonder sometimes if these things are going to change as far as when people, instead of
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:06.420]   just running, which is the right solution, are going to fight back and especially when
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.460]   there are crowds of people.
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.060]   I don't know.
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:14.540]   I haven't reviewed the reports and I wouldn't venture an opinion past that.
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.580]   But I think the same thing is going to happen.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:17.780]   I do.
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:21.420]   So after fighting back, then the last two is treating injury.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:22.420]   Treat injury.
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.140]   So be prepared to treat injury.
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:27.780]   There's no reason in the world, if you're concerned about safety and physical safety,
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:33.300]   you may not be allowed to have a gun, but there's no reason why you can't have a trauma
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:38.500]   kit, a good first aid kit with some tourniquets.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:41.540]   There's no reason why you can't take some training on how to use that.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:45.940]   Whether that's just you tooling around YouTube and making a couple of purchases on Amazon,
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:50.380]   whether that's taking good legitimate medical class, medical training, there's no reason
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:53.180]   why you can't be prepared to save a life.
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:58.980]   And my understanding as a non-medical person, my understanding is that there is a good chance
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:05.200]   of being able to save somebody's life in a situation like this if there is quick response
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:10.820]   to severe wounds, such as wound packing and a severe bleeding wound, if you have the right
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:16.300]   dressing for that, or if there is the ability to apply a tourniquet.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:20.700]   Now I couldn't go beyond that with my personal knowledge.
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:24.140]   I would defer you to somebody who knows, and that's their area of expertise.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:29.020]   But I do think that this is valuable, and I think this is important to consider, because
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:34.380]   frequently, they may be able to save somebody's life by having some knowledge about medical
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:35.460]   treatment.
[01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:40.140]   In these active shooter scenarios, there's going to be some time while the police deal
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:44.940]   with things, and there aren't going to be—paramedics are not allowed in until the situation is
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:45.940]   resolved.
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:51.940]   It's not like the battlefield that you see in a movie where the medic is in there with
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:53.140]   bullets whistling over their head.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:57.420]   The paramedics are not allowed in until the police resolve the situation.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:03.220]   That may take minutes, it may take hours, but you might be there with the ability to
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:04.900]   treat injury.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:08.760]   So even if you're aware of—I think most of us know pressure is probably the best thing
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.220]   to apply to a wound, even if you don't have any equipment.
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:15.580]   I think most of us—are there enough medical personnel around that can say, "Look, take
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.480]   this shirt, put pressure here, try to stop the bleeding."
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.460]   But a little bit of training and a little bit of a trauma kit handy would really go
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:23.460]   a long way.
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:24.460]   And then finally, communicate.
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:29.260]   I think it's important to have a tool to be able to communicate.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:33.100]   A simple obvious example is having a cell phone.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:37.020]   Always having a cell phone that's handy, having a cell phone that's charged.
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:42.500]   And then in this case, I think it's valuable to consider, if I were a teacher, I'd want
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:47.700]   to have a little bag put together with a few simple things, like maybe, like I said, some
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:54.180]   door wedges, a hammer, maybe some kind of edged weapon if I were able to do that.
[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:57.940]   But I'd at least want to have a cell phone handy, and I want to have one handy.
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:02.300]   Now, most of the time, people are going to have their own cell phone, but get yourself
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:07.260]   a little cheap flip phone, a feature phone that's not a smartphone that can be used
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:08.820]   to dial 911.
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:16.500]   If I were hiding in a closet somewhere, and my cell phone had been on the other side of
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:21.820]   the room, not on me, locked in a desk drawer, I'd a whole lot rather, while I'm going
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:26.380]   out the door, reach up to the top of a bookshelf and grab down a little bag that has a phone
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:30.140]   that I can use to call 911, so that way if I'm stuck hiding in a closet, I have a cell
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:31.300]   phone handy.
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.300]   So consider that.
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:37.500]   If you are in a risky environment where this is actually worth planning for, then consider,
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.500]   is there a way to have a cell phone charged or an extra one?
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.500]   And then in some scenarios, maybe a radio.
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:46.780]   If you have the ability to have a radio, for example, if you live in a place that's earthquake
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:52.020]   prone, work in a Mexico City, you better have a radio as part of your scenario.
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:59.620]   You live on a mud, or California, but in Mexico City, you live on basically a big mud flat
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:04.580]   that is an awful place to live with regard to earthquake risk, so your kit needs to have
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:05.580]   a radio.
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:09.380]   And something with charged batteries, you should have some extra lithium batteries in
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:14.580]   there, so that if you're trapped inside of a building, the rescuers are there, you can
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:18.700]   have the potential to reach out to them with your little radio, your little FRS radio that
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:22.740]   you bought, and be able to communicate with them and tell them, "Listen, I'm in here."
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:26.580]   If they know you're alive and they know you're there, they'll move heaven and earth to get
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.580]   you out.
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:30.860]   If they don't know you're there and they don't know you're alive, they won't.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:32.340]   So those are my ideas for you.
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.900]   I hope that these are helpful for you.
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:41.180]   Today's show is longer than I anticipated, but I really think that most of what I shared
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.420]   with you today is very practical.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:51.580]   I hope that you can take this and interpret it into what is appropriate for your situation.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:23:01.140]   But I wanted to give you some ideas that are actually usable, that don't require you changing
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:07.580]   the mind of 150 million people in order to have something.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:11.940]   This is what bugs me to no end about so many modern debates.
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:17.700]   People want to change the mind of 150 million people and big giant laws and use government
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:23.420]   coercion instead of saying, "Here are some practical things you can do."
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:28.620]   Almost any issue in our society, there are things that we need to solve with legislation.
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:29.940]   I believe that.
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.220]   I really do.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:35.460]   There are problems that can be solved with legislation.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:41.100]   But solving things for hundreds of millions of people with legislation is a very ham-handed
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:46.940]   way of going about it and is usually very poorly done.
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:53.940]   But educating people and giving ideas can be effectively done.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:24:00.300]   So you're hearing the frustration in my voice, and I've tried to keep myself on a tight emotional
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:06.300]   leash, but you're hearing the frustration in my voice about people not talking about
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.980]   practical tools and tactics.
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:12.340]   Don't wait for the government to act.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:15.260]   You act.
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:21.300]   Don't wait for the government to somehow give you the permission to carry a gun.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:22.980]   Carry a gun.
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:28.380]   Don't wait for the government to require you to get training to use a gun.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.980]   Go and get training.
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:34.700]   Talk about guns in a different show that'll be so that those of you who don't want to
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:37.020]   hear my thoughts on guns can check out.
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:42.980]   But don't wait if you are a teacher and you're concerned about...
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:46.780]   I think I've given enough practical ideas here of things that I think would help.
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:54.460]   Now, if you have inside knowledge that what I've described here won't help, well, tell
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:55.460]   me.
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:56.460]   I'll have you on the show to tell me what will help.
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:02.700]   If you are a police officer, if you have experience and knowledge in this situation, and you can
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:07.140]   give some practical tools for what people can do that don't require changing the constitution
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:11.940]   of the United States, you email me and I'll have you on the show.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:18.460]   But these are things that you can do, and fighting back will help.
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:25.700]   There's a big difference between looking for the ideal and say, "How can we stop all mass
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:26.700]   shootings?"
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:28.300]   You're not going to do it.
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.180]   It's not going to happen.
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:33.340]   As long as people are sinners and there's sin in their hearts, and as long as people
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:38.380]   can come up with weapons, everything from a gun to a stick to a knife to a train to
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:40.860]   a plane to a car...
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.620]   I'm not making these things up.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:44.580]   The battle over...
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:45.900]   Forgive me.
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:49.940]   The battle over weaponry is nothing new.
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:54.220]   In a separate show, the example that I always use, if you go back and when I was a kid,
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:56.880]   I read the book Robin Hood.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:03.620]   In that book about Robin Hood, there's the character Little John, who's this friar who...
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:07.180]   Sorry, Little John of Friartuck, that's what it was.
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:10.740]   There's this character where these two characters are fighting.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:13.660]   Little John and Friartuck are fighting with their staffs.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:16.020]   Well, why do they have big sticks?
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:18.580]   Why do they have staffs?
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:21.580]   Because the government said they couldn't have a sword.
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:25.300]   And so the way that they got around the law, the way that the peasants got around the law
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:29.620]   was by having a big giant staff, a walking staff.
[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:33.020]   What are they going to pass a law that says you can't have a walking staff?
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:35.660]   And there was exact same thing about the non-permissive environment.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:38.060]   Guarantee, some of those guys had a sword.
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:42.160]   Guarantee that as firearms started to be developed, some of them had firearms.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.220]   But the entire point was this battle of saying, "Well, we're going to restrict the peasantry
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:49.140]   from having a sword."
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:50.140]   Peasants said, "Okay."
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:55.020]   I bet you some of them had a sword under their mattress at home, had it hidden in the woods
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:56.740]   for if they really needed it.
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:00.540]   But they just said, "You guys are going to engage in sword control.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:03.400]   We're going to have our staffs."
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.900]   And you give a skilled person a staff, it's a deadly weapon.
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:13.560]   Somebody attacks you with a stick, you are legally authorized to use deadly force to
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.560]   defend yourself.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:21.020]   A stick, a hammer, a bat, these are deadly weapons.
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:23.020]   Somebody attacks you with a hammer, you are...
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:26.620]   I'm not giving legal advice, I'm just saying the doctrine of self-defense.
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:31.100]   Somebody attacks you with a hammer, you are legally authorized to defend yourself with
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:34.380]   deadly force.
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:38.140]   Point is that this is not a new debate.
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:41.380]   But there are those who are going to spend all their time arguing and saying, "We got
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:46.820]   to get rid of all the sticks because the peasants are holding around sticks."
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.380]   Those who would just say, "You know what?
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:51.140]   I think it's a good thing for people to be able to defend themselves or let's get around
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:54.180]   the government's stupid rules with a new approach."
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:28:00.260]   The point I'm driving is I want to be one of practical solutions.
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:03.020]   I want to look and say, "How can I make things better?"
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:08.100]   And the point I was trying to say with any of these, I do not think that by you having
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:14.060]   a baseball bat or a bag with half a dozen baseball bats and a bunch of baseballs in
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:19.580]   your classroom, I don't think that's going to keep anybody from dying if some kid comes
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:24.500]   into your school with an AR-15 and starts shooting the place up.
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:29.500]   I don't think you can guarantee a zero death casualty event.
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:35.060]   But you may be able to protect the lives of your students and you may be able to cut the
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:39.620]   death toll from 17 to 11.
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:42.820]   And that's really worth doing.
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:48.780]   So don't be lazy and spend all your time arguing about things that are unsolvable.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:52.620]   The gun control debate is absolutely intractable.
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:58.100]   Now I'll give you my thoughts on that at a different show, but it's not going to change.
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:03.420]   But what you can do is you can say, "What are some practical steps that I can take in
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:10.900]   response to this that may help me within my sphere of sovereignty, within my jurisdiction
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:12.980]   to improve things?"
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:15.420]   I think that's worth doing and I hope you do too.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:21.100]   Thank you for listening to today's show, You Radical You.
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:23.580]   Before you go, I have one question for you.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:26.500]   Was there an idea in today's show that helped you?
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:27.500]   Were you inspired?
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:28.500]   Were you motivated?
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:33.420]   Did you get an idea on how you can earn more or spend less money or invest more wisely
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:39.020]   or perhaps protect yourself from catastrophe and insulate yourself from financial disaster
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.980]   or just improve your life and your lifestyle?
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:44.140]   Well, if so, I have three requests for you.
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:47.340]   Number one, take action.
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:49.420]   Listening doesn't improve your life.
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:53.220]   Doing, however, can revolutionize your life.
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:58.980]   Number two, take the idea or concept that you learned from me and go and teach somebody
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:00.180]   else.
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:03.860]   If you want to really learn something, go and teach it to others.
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:09.300]   That ripple effect of you to someone else will systematically transform your life and
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.540]   the lives of all those around you.
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:16.220]   Number three, if you thought there was financial value in what you just heard, I'd ask you
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:20.260]   to come by and pay for it at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:22.700]   Now however much you want to pay, that's up to you.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:26.700]   But if the show is worth a dollar a month, come by RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.980]   and sign up to support the show at a dollar a month.
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:33.140]   If the show is worth $20 a month to you, I'd be happy to have your $20.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:36.580]   Hey, if it's $1,000 a month, write me a check.
[01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:40.900]   Don't send it to me on Patreon, but I'd be happy to have that as well.
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:43.700]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron is where you can do that.
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:43.900]   Thank you.
