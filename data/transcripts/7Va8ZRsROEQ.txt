[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360]   You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs, where we give you practical insights into jobs and
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.360]   careers.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.360]   Today, we're going to talk about how to deal with imposter syndrome.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.400]   Now, if you're not familiar with what that is, it's defined as feeling incompetent or
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.440]   unqualified, even though there's evidence to the contrary, right?
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.980]   And so for me, that happened at LinkedIn, where prior to LinkedIn, I had to experience
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.680]   all facets of web marketing, whether it's on the strategy side, user experience, design,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.000]   testing, development, I had enough under my belt to allow me to succeed at all the previous
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   companies.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.960]   The difference at LinkedIn was I joined a group that was essentially a startup.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.960]   Now it's LinkedIn Learning.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.920]   Everyone knows what LinkedIn Learning is, it's part of the Talent Solutions portfolio.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.680]   When I joined LinkedIn, they had just acquired lynda.com.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.280]   And so there was a need to A, transition to brand, and B, build a new enterprise experience.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.160]   And the challenge there was you have a very strong entity in lynda.com, you're building
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.600]   a new brand from the ground up, and there's things like SEO to take into consideration,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.960]   and there's like your website, but there's also the product.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.360]   So all of them are competing, right, for SEO visibility.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.400]   There's also building the web experience from ground up.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.160]   So when it came to building web experience and SEO, like that was no problem at all.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.880]   Where I ran into an issue was about seven or eight months into my job, I had launched
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.880]   everything.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.960]   And now LinkedIn, as you guys all know, probably, or not surprisingly, it's a very, very data
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.240]   driven company, which is fantastic.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.720]   It's probably one of the best companies I've worked for where the data is so robust.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.480]   The data hygiene is pretty valid, like you can trust it to make decisions.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.840]   So the expectation of insight was really, really high.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.920]   Prior to joining LinkedIn, I've always leveraged data and gotten insight out of the data.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.880]   What I had not done up to that point was pull the data, right?
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.760]   So you're talking about pulling data out of Google Analytics, pulling data out of Tableau,
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   looking into SFDC.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.440]   I had experience with Google Analytics, very little exposure to SFDC and Tableau.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:37.760]   And so my fear was always that if I'm pulling the data incorrectly, then all of my conclusions
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.800]   will be off mark.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.500]   Or I'll be pulling the data set in a way that other people are not.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.240]   And it'll be very, very clear that I'm looking at a different data set, right?
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.640]   And there are a few meetings where I was exposed, where I would present a slide.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.640]   And like everyone's smart enough where they could say, "Hey, look, that slide doesn't
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.080]   jive with something I saw 10 slides ago."
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.120]   Or "Yesterday I saw a slide from a PMM and they're using something totally different.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.680]   Like what's going on?"
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.600]   And so I was always feeling like I was behind the ball.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.760]   And it came to a point, it was about the one year mark, where my manager, he pulled me
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.480]   aside and he was like, "Look, man, we hired you because you're supposed to know everything.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.180]   And your ability to deliver analytics and dashboards is just not up to par."
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.360]   And that hurt me so deeply because I thought I was actually making positive progress on
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   my dashboards.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.940]   And what I realized was I was just delivering what he was asking for, sometimes correctly,
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.940]   sometimes not.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.200]   What I was not doing was bringing anything additional to the table.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.480]   And so I felt like I wasn't providing value.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.200]   So I really questioned the value of my employment at that time.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.640]   And remember, this is a company where when I came in and interviewed for the job, the
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.120]   senior director interviewed me as well.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.520]   And the questions that they asked were so in the weeds and specific, they clearly understood
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.640]   my role.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.000]   And so essentially, I was surrounded by people who I looked to my left, looked to my right.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.480]   I basically came to the conclusion that everyone could do my job.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.200]   And I wasn't sure why I was there.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.760]   And so I entered a period of depression.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.520]   And that was the first time in my career that I felt this way.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.080]   And it wasn't until a change of managers where it totally flipped around, where he came in
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.640]   and I decided to kind of, like in a previous episode, we talked about kind of getting to
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.400]   our know our limits when you're feeling in over your head.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.960]   I kind of drew on that where I came to him, I said, "Hey, look, let me tell you what I
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.520]   think I'm doing good with my job.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.720]   And being my new manager, let me tell you why I'm struggling a little bit.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.400]   Here's what I'm trying to do.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.280]   And here's the output I've been creating.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.720]   And here's where I think I'm doing it wrong.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.160]   And here's why I think I'm doing things not so well."
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.560]   I could really use some advisement.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.680]   For him, it was also his first time running a digital organization.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.720]   So he was doing PMM before, now he's in web.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.760]   And so now the situation is a different, we're kind of self-discovering it.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.040]   He sent me to a lot of resources because I was very articulate about my shortcomings.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   And then got proactive.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.560]   I was like, "Hey, I was like, you know what, you know, for my OKRs or objectives and key
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.600]   results of which my performance is measured by, I want to add some things on there that
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.440]   are skills-based because I want to be held accountable to this.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.760]   And I also want you to know I'm serious about overcoming these shortcomings."
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:49.080]   And so part of it was like presentation, pace of speech, slide design, and then analytics.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.640]   So those are all things I ended up putting on my OKRs.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.600]   And that was the way that I was able to kind of break through that.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.400]   And he said something to me that really broke me out of my imposter syndrome mindset.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.120]   And he literally sat down to me and he said, "Look, Tim, you were hired because you knew
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.560]   what you could like, wait, sorry, you were hired because you knew how to do the job.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.640]   The only person who's telling you that you can't do your job is you.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.400]   So get out of your head, pull yourself together and just be you and do you."
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.800]   And so that was just so, I needed to hear that.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.880]   And so every time now when I talk to someone and they're struggling with them, I usually
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.960]   throw that piece of feedback first because they just, you know, like, "You're hired
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.880]   because you know how to do your job.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.880]   Don't set yourself short."
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:43.720]   That was my first, like, that was my example.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:53.360]   It sounds, you know, the thing I take away from your example is how our professional
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:01.960]   lives can, we can, I think the sense is that they're somehow dispassionate that we apply
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.640]   objectively our skills.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.760]   We objectively apply our skills and experience to solve problems in a rational and reasonable
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.960]   way that were logical, you know, that the plans are logical and proceed in a logical
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.960]   fashion.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.560]   But in fact, so much of this is underpinned by emotions.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.760]   And so when things go awry, why wouldn't we take it personal?
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:34.560]   And I think that's okay because that's a reminder, if we have ever forgotten that, that emotions
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.680]   are really at the heart of so much of who we are as people.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.640]   And yeah, it just really struck me how, you know, clearly you have a lot of experience,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.280]   Tim, and you've achieved a lot of success in your career.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:56.760]   And yet you had this experience that hurt you deeply, as you said, pain, it was painful.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.240]   It was mostly painful.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:07.240]   I can imagine, you know, you sought out, you know, various ways to kind of both find answers,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.240]   but also find consolation for that.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.640]   And I think it's just something for folks out there that feel like they need to be perfect,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:21.400]   that, you know, perfection is really impossible.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.200]   It's sort of a non sequitur when it comes to just people in our careers anyway.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:34.520]   Do you want to share your imposter experience, Troy?
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.400]   Well, I mean, just thinking about it a little more, I mean, honestly, it's every day, right?
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:49.000]   And what I have been doing almost exclusively for the last five years is ghostwriting.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.400]   And that means basically pretending to be somebody on some level, right?
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.040]   And, you know, that process is always a little bit uncomfortable, but it's especially uncomfortable
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.040]   at first.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.440]   You know, over time, if I have a long-term client, that's always the best because I get
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.680]   to know them and I can really start to sort of hear their voice in my head, right?
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:18.160]   But the first time can always be a little bit daunting, painful, nerve-wracking.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.760]   Like, can I really pretend to be this person?
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:29.600]   The best example, maybe the most overwhelming example was this article that I wrote that
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:37.160]   ended up getting placed in the Financial Times, which I'm really proud of, but it was writing
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:45.880]   for a really well-known British philanthropist who had started an institute that focused
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:53.480]   on digital access back in the early 2000s, but I wasn't working with her directly.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:01.120]   So I was working with a VC that sat on the board of that foundation with this person.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.040]   And so she was basically my point of contact for ghostwriting for somebody else.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:14.400]   So it was like the old game of phone, right, where you pass the phone and it's, you know,
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.620]   two generations later, the story is totally, totally different.
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.600]   And anyway, so it was a really uncomfortable process, but I had to keep reminding myself
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:30.840]   that even though I'd never met this woman, I was writing for a different dialect of English,
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:37.760]   in British English, I knew a lot about the evolution of technology from the period of
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.560]   this institute because I'd been working in technology ever since then and certainly was
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:51.040]   aware of the rise of social media and the big challenges of misinformation, disinformation
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.800]   and some of the things that we wanted to cover in the piece.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:01.000]   And so, and I had to let go of the like, you know, the tone of this might not be perfect,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.040]   but I know how to put, I know how to string together a story.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.040]   And so that's what I did.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:14.120]   And I submitted the draft and to my VC contact that was here, and it eventually worked its
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.080]   way to the philanthropist and, you know, the feedback I got was, was really positive, still
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.960]   never had any direct interaction with her.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:29.920]   They did change a little bit of the, you know, the California English, if you will, to British
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.720]   English, but the core of the story, the thread was there, and I'm pretty proud of how that
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   worked.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:45.160]   I guess that, you know, the takeaway is, again, it's easy to feel overwhelmed, it's easy to
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.640]   feel like an imposter, it's a very emotional and natural response to being uncomfortable
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   in certain situations.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   But again, I was hired for a reason, for my experience and my abilities, and I had to
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.720]   let go of the idea that I was actually going to be this person that I'd never met, right,
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.840]   and just do the best that I could with the tools that I had.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:20.280]   My experience, just if I could jump in, is maybe more of a view of my experience over
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:27.240]   many jobs, as opposed to like one job where, Troy, you felt perhaps that you weren't sure
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.120]   how you were going to show up for it, and then you overcame that.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:38.360]   I had an experience a few years ago where Snapchat wanted to hire a content strategist,
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:44.080]   and in their kind of world, content strategist is sort of like a creative director, copywriter
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:51.320]   person who comes up with campaigns and concepts and manages teams of writers and designers
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:58.920]   and producers to create the assets, and so whatever they might be, digital ads, email
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   campaigns.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:07.200]   So I was recruited at one point, and the rate was too low for me, so I turned it down.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   And then they came back to me maybe six months or nine months later, and they said, you know,
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.240]   the hiring manager loves your experience, you had all this experience at Google, they
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.240]   want you.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.520]   So I asked for like twice as much money, and they agreed.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.160]   And so I was given a contract, I wasn't hired full time, I came in through an agency, but
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.080]   essentially it was like a six-month contract.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:39.800]   And I started contributing, and feedback was great, you know, check-ins with my manager,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:45.540]   and they were always positive, they were happy with my performance.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:52.080]   They brought in a new manager at like a level below the VP or the director, I forget what
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.000]   the title was.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.760]   And this person was great, I think they had great instincts and experience, and all the
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.400]   people at the management level had come in from Facebook, Facebook had like laid off
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:14.280]   many, many people in the content group, and they all kind of, and this team had been staffed,
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.880]   many of them at the managerial level by ex-Facebook folks, so they all had a certain, like, approach
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:26.040]   to management, which was consistent positivity, but I always felt like I wasn't really getting
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.380]   the full story.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:35.520]   It was sort of always framed, but never really honest in a way, I don't want to necessarily
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:41.080]   put that out there, but my sense was there were things that were framed in a way that
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.760]   were not necessarily the full picture, and that proved to be true in that over the course
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:53.040]   of a few months, you know, my contribution, I felt, was still at the same level, I was
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:15:03.360]   running campaigns and, you know, sort of a lead with a number of contributors that were
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.240]   working with me on specific projects, and I remember I had a meeting with my manager,
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.360]   this new person, on maybe a Thursday, and checked in on my performance toward specific
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.000]   goals and things like that, and she's like, you're doing great, you're doing a great job,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.160]   keep doing what you're doing, and the very next day I got fired.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.760]   And I was devastated, and it wasn't as if I had never been fired before because of the
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:43.080]   creative things happen, business climate changes, it's the subjective, your work and the reception
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:49.000]   of your work is often based on subjectivity and bias and all sorts of things, so I really
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.840]   never know, and I don't to this day know why in fact I was fired, and I had talked to other
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.880]   people in the group that had stayed on and they didn't know either, the fact is I won't
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.800]   ever know unless this person reaches out to me, which I doubt they will, because I tried
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.120]   to connect with them on LinkedIn and they never accepted it.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.320]   So whatever the case may be in terms of the managerial approach, right or wrong, they
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.520]   did what they had to do, but I was left with this feeling like despite all my, at that
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   point I had been in the business for more than two decades, I had lots of wins, lots
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:27.360]   of achievements, lots of successes, won awards, things like that, started a business, an agency,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:33.400]   and yet for some reason it didn't work out, and it made me feel like a fraud, it made
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:38.920]   me feel like I didn't know what I was doing, even though I had all this success that maybe
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:48.560]   it was all a lie, maybe it was all just somehow manufactured but it wasn't real, and you know
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.160]   I've come to realize that that's part of my perfectionism and my need for everyone to
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.320]   like me, and in business that is a really hard, you're going to be disappointed if you
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.600]   go into a job with the expectation that you're always going to do everything right and everyone's
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.760]   going to like you, let alone love you, it's just never going to happen, some people will
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:14.480]   love you, a few, a few maybe if you're lucky will really love you and love what you do
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.960]   and you'll stay in relationship with them over many jobs, or you know you two are great
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:26.800]   examples in terms of my career when we started working together, I know I was at Logitech
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:34.200]   from 2006 to 2012, and you know I met both of you there in that time period and we're
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:41.720]   still talking, so it does happen, I just think the imposter syndrome, if it is a syndrome
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.960]   I guess that's more of a clinical term, but I don't always have these persistent feelings
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.720]   of self-doubt like I'm going to be exposed as a fraud, they come and go, I have experiences
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.280]   where they're more poignant than others, there's probably you know good reasons why I wasn't
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:05.040]   meeting whatever objectives they had, maybe I was too expensive, who knows, but you know
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:12.520]   the thing is, is they become part of your story, and I think they become part of your
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:19.040]   story of resilience, and whether it's imposter syndrome or feeling like you're in over your
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.360]   head or fear of failure, these things help demonstrate how you can walk through the fire
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:31.400]   and come out you know a little bit burned, but a little bit more experienced in the process.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.320]   Yeah you know I really appreciate you guys as examples, because actually this topic of
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:41.680]   how you deal with either failure or feeling of inadequacy or with this imposter syndromes,
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.360]   I always use these stories actually to break the ice with people, to build relationships,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.640]   and I always bring it up during job interviews, why?
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:57.520]   Because it makes you human, makes you relatable, and there's acknowledgement of growth in going
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.200]   through this process of building your own story, right?
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:06.520]   And so for anyone who's dealing with this, just remember like you were hired because
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:14.760]   you are capable, now circumstances may make you feel like you're struggling, or your emotions
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.400]   might be tied to the circumstance, but always come back to your core self knowing that you've
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.560]   got what it takes.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.200]   In all the feedback you received, search out for the truth nuggets, and then ignore the
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.040]   packaging of everything else, right?
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:33.640]   And then figure out what those core truths are, and use that as a starting point, right?
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.260]   Because there's always going to be some truth to harsh feedback, and some of it not.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.560]   But know that you have value, and don't ever let a circumstance dictate your sense of value
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.560]   or self-worth.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:50.520]   Don't be so tied into this immediate outcome such that your perception of yourself is impacted.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.720]   Hey guys, thanks again for watching and listening.
