[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.180]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode, I want to recap a couple
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.520]   of posts that I wrote regarding the housing market.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.480]   The first post was called "Understanding Why People Get Into Property Bidding Wars."
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.040]   Personally, I'm against getting into a bidding war because I know my emotions could make
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.040]   me go a little bit nuts and make me lose my financial discipline when buying a home.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.660]   And the second article is called "Analyzing Home Price Dynamics, A Guide to Smarter Purchases."
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.680]   Well, it's the first half of 2024 and the housing market is picking up steam.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.720]   Here in San Francisco, I have seen multiple bidding wars on over a dozen houses on the
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.480]   west side of San Francisco and this has been remarkably different from the second half
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.840]   of 2023 when it was relatively dead as people waited and hemmed and hawed about buying property
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.720]   because mortgage rates were much higher and there's a lot of uncertainty.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.340]   However, with mortgage rates above 6.5-7% for at least 18 months now, it seems like
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.380]   the buyer is more comfortable with the way things are.
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.680]   And so, with pent-up demand, with every single month trending at below pre-Covid volume,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.780]   that creates pent-up demand as given life goes on, well, that pent-up demand has got
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.960]   to be unleashed somehow and it seems like it's being unleashed right now.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.600]   But here are some takeaways that I have come away with after analyzing these type of price
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.220]   moves.
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.780]   First of all, beginning of the year, it's a new year, people are excited, pumped, they
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.560]   get their year-end bonuses hitting their bank account usually by February.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.060]   There's a resolution to try to do something new or to improve your finances or maybe to
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.420]   buy a home.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.220]   And so, if you look historically, prices of homes at the beginning of the year generally
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.220]   go up and then they fade for the rest of the year with the slowest time during the winter
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.340]   fourth quarter, holiday, Thanksgiving, Christmas, any other type of holiday.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.860]   People are just more chill and also people have spent down their excess savings and then
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.980]   it's the new year with new income, new bonuses and let's go.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.180]   So, if you're a buyer in a hot housing market or a strong housing market and you're seeing
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.460]   these bidding wars, I don't think you should get into these bidding wars, especially if
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.180]   the offer you're putting is above the 30/30/3 home buying guideline that I have given and
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.740]   represented for you all to follow.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.200]   Because if you surpass that guideline and if you win, you'll experience what is called
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.300]   the winner's curse where nobody else was willing to pay that price you were paying, therefore
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.540]   you were the top dollar, you won.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.820]   But that also means that unless the housing market continues to go up, you have basically
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.180]   top ticked the housing market.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.860]   Now, thankfully, in a rising market, you're generally not going to top tick the market.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.140]   Just like in a downward market, you're generally not going to bottom tick it and then suddenly
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.700]   a month after you bought, housing prices are going to rebound, right?
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.580]   It's generally not like that.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.540]   But what I have seen is, this is since buying property since 2003 on my own, is that you
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.260]   don't really want to get into these bidding wars in the spring because it just pushes
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.640]   prices way up and it makes you emotional and it makes you undisciplined.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.180]   What you want to do is wait until the fourth quarter when that heat has faded.
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.500]   Generally that fade doesn't go below where the previous year's fade bottom was, right?
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.460]   So generally higher highs and lower lows.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.660]   But it's much better to look for properties, I think, in the second half of the year.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.980]   Maybe inventory is down.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.540]   Maybe you don't find that perfect, perfect house.
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.020]   But you don't overpay.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.300]   You don't have the risk of overpaying.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.500]   And so that's feedback number one.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.340]   Wait until the fourth quarter instead of the first quarter.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.220]   The second very important takeaway from my post on analyzing home price dynamics is that
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.220]   prices move quickly on the upside with real estate and very slowly on the downside.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.020]   If you look at the charts, I offer five charts of various homes that sold in the first half
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:43.060]   of 2024, you can see a price fade over a two year period from the highs of early 2022.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.420]   And it just up, up, up, down, down, down.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.340]   It goes a little bit until first quarter of 2024.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.180]   And then what you see happening are bidding wars for all these homes and the price chart
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.020]   literally spikes up and surpasses the 2022 high.
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.300]   So what does this tell you?
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:11.220]   This tells you, in my opinion, that it's better to be one year, two years too early when buying
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.100]   a home rather than one month too late.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.900]   Literally maybe one day too late because once you see those bidding wars go on, people just
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.500]   get a little bit nuts and then they just bid over asking, way over asking, and they just
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.740]   immediately reset the price.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.780]   And this is very different from stocks where let's say you have a bad quarter, bad guidance,
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.900]   management did something shady, I don't know, competition was really fierce, bad government
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:48.300]   regulations, the stock could easily drop 5, 10, 15, 20 plus percent right after that announcement.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.540]   And on the flip side, the stock can rise 5 to 20% quite easily after positive guidance,
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.620]   blowout numbers, a new technology, new invention, and so forth for stocks.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.300]   So stocks are more volatile on the upside and downside, whereas real estate is less
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.900]   volatile on the downside, but it seems to be quite volatile on the upside.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.340]   And why is it less volatile on the downside?
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.260]   Well, transaction costs.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.180]   People might be locked into a low mortgage rate.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.260]   People might not want to move because their kids enjoy the school.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.900]   Owners might think, well, I don't believe my home price has gone down because they don't
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.420]   see liquid prices every single day transacting.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.460]   And then maybe home sellers are stubborn, like I won't accept 10% down or 20% down.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.060]   I'm just going to stick to it, keep enjoying my life and ride it out until the good times
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.060]   return.
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.960]   So this is the typical mentality of a homeowner.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.260]   But for a stock owner, that means just clicking the buttons left and right with no commission
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:57.260]   costs, so you can easily see how stocks are much more volatile than real estate.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:03.940]   The final final takeaway from my post on analyzing home price dynamics is that the downturns
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.740]   generally last between one, one and a half to four years, and the upturns generally last
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.900]   twice that.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:17.420]   Hence, if you are a buyer, you're in the market and you notice that prices are softening,
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:23.340]   it probably is best to wait at least one year, wait until a year for prices to soften a little
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.220]   further and for home sellers to lose a little bit of hope and accept the reality that their
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.300]   homes have declined in value.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.540]   Again, home sellers are stubborn.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:38.820]   They believe theirs is more special or they've got a lower mortgage rate and it's affordable.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.700]   So why not just wait it out?
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.740]   The risk, however, of waiting too long, as I just mentioned, is that a nice home might
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.140]   pop up and everybody wants it, and then the prices just reset to all-time highs.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.540]   That is the risk of waiting a little bit too long.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.480]   Ideally, you would wait perfectly, let's say, two and a half, three years, and then the
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.020]   very next month, home prices start rebounding.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.020]   But it's really unrealistic to expect that type of perfect timing.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.620]   Homes are slow moving.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.860]   Real estate is much slower moving than the stock market.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:15.260]   So I would wait at least one year, but not too long, because I think it's better to be
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.300]   again one to two years early.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:23.580]   So that maybe sweet spot of waiting once you see home prices turn down is probably one
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.340]   and a half to two years.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:31.660]   Maybe you are one to two years too early before the home market rebounds, but that's okay
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.940]   because you didn't buy the home to only live there for a couple of years.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.220]   You bought the home knowing you're going to live there for five, seven, ten plus years,
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.220]   right?
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.220]   I hope so.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.500]   Now, moving on to the second post regarding understanding why people get into property
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.500]   bidding wars.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.980]   I really wanted to dig into the psychology why because I am against getting into a bidding
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.980]   war.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:55.980]   It's very emotional.
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.380]   Generally, you lose a bidding war because it's a war, right?
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.340]   Five, ten, twenty other offers, it's like, "Ah, probably not going to win."
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.220]   And then if you win, you have the winner's curse where nobody else is willing to pay
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.220]   that price.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.140]   And then you got to sit with it and you got to hope that the economy doesn't crumble and
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:17.540]   crash and fall as soon after you sign that dotted line and send in that money.
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:23.620]   So I surveyed my Twitter followers, my newsletter readers, definitely don't forget to subscribe
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:30.540]   at financialseminary.com/news to understand why you would get into a bidding war when
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.500]   you could have not get into a bidding war in the fourth quarter of last year, right?
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.860]   Why compete when you don't have to compete?
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.100]   And so here was some of the feedback, anonymous feedback for one.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:47.660]   Here, in 2022, "Two years ago, we bought a small condo in a college town for my daughter
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.100]   to live in while she attends school.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.700]   I grew up near that town, so I'm familiar with and I love the area.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.460]   Yes, I perceived it as a bit risky to compete in a bidding war for the condo.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.460]   However, we heard horror stories about so many college students in that area who struggled
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.460]   to locate suitable housing.
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.540]   We did not want to search and compete for a place every school year.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.300]   Also, my daughter is very private and picky and hasn't done well with roommates, and I
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:20.300]   intend to keep the property for the long term, so I wasn't as worried about the exact purchase
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.300]   price.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.900]   We needed the property since I would have had to pay rent at another place if I didn't
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.900]   buy."
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:34.260]   Another feedback, Jaime Mraz, a realtor based in Phoenix, Arizona, said, "I am a realtor
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.300]   and my experience as a buyer's agent with overbidding has been circumstance."
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.940]   In other words, expiring lease landlord is selling or finding that perfect long term
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.780]   home coupled with sufficient wealth so they can afford it.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.460]   And then I asked, "Well, what about the fear of top ticking the market?"
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.060]   And he said, "Ah, that fear only exists on Twitter.
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.940]   I always counsel my clients on where we are in the market, but their circumstance and
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.100]   desire for the right home overrides market data, especially if they can comfortably afford
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.100]   it."
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.780]   Hmm, I don't know about that.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:12.140]   Another person, Marcus, 40 years old buyer in San Francisco, "Before buying our house,
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.300]   my wife and I resided in a one bedroom, one bathroom apartment, but with a baby on the
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.540]   way, we needed more space.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.160]   Having worked as a software engineer at Tesla for five years, I was fortunate to walk away
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.820]   with approximately $2 million in equity after taxes.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.500]   Considering my current salary of $200,000 along with stock options and my wife's salary
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:39.460]   of $150,000, we can comfortably afford to put down $500,000 for a $2.5 million home.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:46.340]   And this means we'd be looking at a monthly mortgage payment of about $13,700 and a 7.3%
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.580]   mortgage rate with over $1.5 million in cash and liquid investments left over.
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.940]   And we anticipate a window of refinance to a lower mortgage rate within the next five
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:56.940]   years."
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.200]   So, that sounds rational to me.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.580]   $1.5 million is a lot of cash and liquid investments left over.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:08.860]   And then Janet, 38, a buyer in a northern Virginia suburb, she said, "During the winter,
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.260]   the housing inventory wasn't particularly appealing and we were determined to only make
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.020]   a purchase when we stumbled upon something truly exceptional.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.700]   Then in March, our dream home appeared, a spacious property with a stunning view.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.180]   What made it even more appealing was that the sellers had recently renovated the house.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.660]   Faring us from potential renovation headaches we'd heard about.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:37.060]   With our children aged 8 and 10 and plans to reside in the area for at least a decade,
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.580]   we felt confident in our decision.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.700]   Schools are exodus and so are the public universities nearby.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:48.780]   We've got a combined income of $280,000 and we purchased the home for $1.2 million that
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.420]   was listed for $1.1 million in Fairfax County."
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.980]   So listeners, what are your thoughts about the feedback on why they got into a bidding
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:57.980]   war?
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.980]   Rational?
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:12:59.980]   Irrational?
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.500]   Well, here are three takeaways that I got from the feedback.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   1.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.500]   They can all comfortably afford the prices they pay.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.940]   There seems to be a misconception from me and others that only desperate or financially
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.580]   inexperienced buyers participate in bidding wars, stretching themselves thin.
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.460]   However, it appears that well-educated buyers with strong financial profiles are the ones
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.180]   willing to overbid on homes.
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.140]   This makes sense because you really need to have confidence if you're going to pay way
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.700]   above asking and beat out the competition.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.260]   You need to know your finances inside and out, you need to be bullish on your income
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.260]   growth and the stability of your household and finances.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.260]   2.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.900]   The second commonality of all the overbidders is that they all have children.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.860]   Every buyer mentioned have children ranging from yet-to-be-born to college students.
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:58.220]   And this is very important to know because once you become a parent, the desire to provide
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.820]   anything and everything for your children is astronomical.
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.820]   It's astronomical to the point of being detrimental sometimes when we over-provide.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.540]   We pay for everything, over-coddle our children into adulthood.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.380]   And I discussed this phenomenon in a previous episode regarding the provider's clock.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.900]   Here our provider's clock is ticking so loudly that we just have to provide everything for
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.900]   our children and never let them go.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.980]   And then what happens is that they never leave the house and they never lunch and it becomes
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.780]   much tougher for them to be a provider going forward.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:36.660]   I believe the best time to own the nicest home you can afford is when your children
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.660]   are at home, when you have the most number of heartbeats at home.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:45.460]   Because after they leave at age 18 or maybe by the age of 25, hopefully, you're not going
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.980]   to want to buy a bigger home.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.180]   You're probably going to keep your home for nostalgia reasons so you can have that room
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:56.380]   available for your little ones to come back and spend time with you before they go off
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.420]   on their own adventure again.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.420]   Or you might want to downsize and simplify your life.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:07.580]   Personally, I am very concerned about the future of housing affordability for my children.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.540]   They're only four and seven so in 20 years, I mean a simple 5% compound annual growth
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:17.780]   rate means home prices are 150 plus percent more expensive than they are now and there's
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.700]   already gripes about home prices being expensive now.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:28.260]   So chances are after a 15 to 20 year period, home prices will be much higher.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.260]   And so as a parent and as someone who listens to personal finance podcasts and reads Financial
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.500]   Samurai, you know about compound growth.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.900]   You know about historical home price growth, stock market growth, all that stuff, right?
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:47.280]   And so it might be responsible as a parent to try to invest in real estate today for
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:53.460]   your children because think about all the home prices that were available when your
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.680]   grandparents, our grandparents, were able to buy.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.700]   And we all marvel, "Wow, that was so cheap so long ago."
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.940]   Well, to stop that from our children saying that 20 years from now and our grandchildren
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.380]   from saying that 40 years from now, we just simply do the best to buy property today.
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.660]   Because there's another interesting phenomenon going on and that is the acceptance, the growing
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:20.060]   acceptance that real estate can be an asset class to provide income for retirement.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.620]   In the past, it might have been just, okay, you buy your primary residence, you buy stocks,
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.220]   you buy bonds and you have a pension.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.260]   But now real estate as an asset class has grown.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:36.820]   There is tremendous amount of capital going to funds, going to investing in built to rent
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.080]   properties or communities all across the country.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.640]   And as a result, I think this trend for returns in real estate is only going to continue.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.780]   So in the past, let's say a household would only think about buying just one property,
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.620]   they might think about now buying two properties, one for themselves and a one rental property.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.900]   Or maybe three properties, one for themselves, one for each of their two children and so
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.900]   forth.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:06.060]   And finally, the common theme from all these people willing to get into bidding wars is
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.420]   that they all plan to live in their new homes for a long time.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.280]   The longer a property bidding war winner lives in their home, the greater their chances of
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.620]   building equity, not losing money.
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.740]   It's the same idea with owning stocks.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:27.340]   If you own stocks after a 10-year period, let's say the S&P 500, 94% chance you're going
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.820]   to have a positive investment return.
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.060]   And that percentage goes to 100% after holding for 20 years.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.940]   Now currently the median home ownership duration is about 12 years.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:44.220]   So if you can live in the home and it's truly a forever home, 12 years should be no problem.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:49.740]   And that winner's curse or top-ticking the market should fade, that concern should fade
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.920]   over time.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.020]   So that's it, folks.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.980]   I still recommend people be careful when bidding on a home.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.340]   I know it's super emotional.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:03.780]   I know you envision yourself in the home for the long term, all the dreams and experiences
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:09.140]   of raising your children or running your dog around the backyard or throwing luau's, whatever
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.140]   it may be.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:16.740]   I know those dreams are powerful motivators to bid, but you have to have discipline because
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.420]   this is through my experience over 22 years.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:26.340]   That is, if you miss out on a home, there will always be another home around the corner
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.340]   to buy.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.340]   All right, folks.
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.920]   That's it for this episode of the Financial Samurai Podcast.
