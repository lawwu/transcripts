[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   [music]
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.620]   Pastor John, it appears that 18th century theologian Jonathan Edwards and his wife
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.820]   owned household and farming slaves, perhaps as many as six total, and they seem to have
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.140]   owned at least one slave at all times, even up until Jonathan's death.
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.740]   How does his slaveholding factor into your evaluation of Jonathan Edwards' theological
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.080]   legacy?
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.360]   Instead of trying to explain how it could be, I think the most helpful thing to do at
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.480]   this point would be to just to answer the question, "Okay, what effect does that have
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.860]   on you, you lover of Edwards?
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.400]   What difference does that make to you?
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.840]   Does that affect you at all?"
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.560]   And here are four or five responses or effects that it has on me.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:07.080]   Number one, it warns me not to idolize or idealize any man except Jesus.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:16.200]   Something's going to show up and disillusion me if I pick out a dead man or a living man
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.840]   as somebody that I'm going to idealize.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.680]   There is no ideal man except Jesus.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.680]   So that's the first thing.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.800]   It's a warning to measure my admiration carefully.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:41.160]   Number two, it cautions me that if he had blind spots on that issue, he may well have
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.680]   had blind spots on other issues, which means that I'm going to now read with some more
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.360]   care.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.920]   I think our vigilance in reading is heightened when we know that a man has blown it.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.980]   In one area we say, "Well, we've got a fallible man on our hands here, therefore we will now
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:13.040]   read with some special vigilance lest we be sucked into approving everything that he says
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.000]   on any issue at all."
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.120]   So let it have a salutary and cautioning effect on how we read an author, including Edwards.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.920]   Third, it makes me marvel that God uses any of us.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.240]   I have documented numerous of my besetting sins.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.760]   I came back to Bethlehem.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.400]   People can go listen to this sermon after my eight-month leave in which I had done a
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.280]   lot of soul searching.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.680]   I think in the sermon I gave to the BCS Chapel in Act the Miracle and one in the church,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:07.240]   I tried to describe the most recurrent sins of John Piper.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:15.720]   It was a very sobering season for me.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:24.040]   I simply have to marvel that, number one, I survived 33 years in the pastorate as an
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.560]   imperfect man and that God used me.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.720]   I didn't just survive.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.160]   I loved it.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.560]   The people, by and large, I think, loved me.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.400]   God did some good.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.000]   I know those sins better than anybody except maybe Noel.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.760]   So I'm not quick to point my finger at Edwards, but I am quick to marvel that he was used
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.960]   and I have been used and I am amazed.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:05.520]   Number four, Edwards' failure in that regard teaches me that sanctification has blank spots
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.960]   like knowledge has blind spots.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.240]   Here's what I mean.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:21.120]   We can be making good progress in five areas of our lives and doing badly in a sixth area,
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:29.440]   a blank area where the Holy Spirit, for some reason, isn't exerting all the power that
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:38.120]   he could and we are resistant and still holding on to some sin.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.040]   We can be knowing rightly in five areas and be mistaken in a sixth area.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:54.120]   So what I see in Edwards' failure is a reminder that not only does knowledge have blind spots,
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.600]   sanctification has blank spots, and all of us should therefore search our lives instead
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.200]   of just congratulating ourselves on the four areas of progress, look at that fifth or sixth
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:14.360]   area that is still such a mess in our lives and pray and appropriate the gospel and the
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.680]   grace of God to fight it.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.800]   And here's one more.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:27.720]   What makes me, Edwards' failure here, makes me pray for light on my life and on my day.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.760]   What are my blind spots?
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.040]   What are my days, my church's blind spots?
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.600]   What is the church blind to today that in 200 years the godly will look back and say,
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.880]   "How could they possibly have done that or believe that or let that happen or go that
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.880]   way?"
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:59.240]   And so given how amazingly godly Edwards was, I do not presume that any level of sanctification
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.880]   I attain in this life means there's not something else to be ferreted out.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.800]   Keep your servant back from presumptuous sins and cleanse me of hidden faults, Psalm 19
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   prays.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:24.360]   So I hope that the flaws of my greatest teachers, and Edwards is about the greatest, will do
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.960]   me good in the end, and I hope we don't have to hide them in order to realize they can
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   serve us.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.400]   Yes, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.280]   The sermons mentioned earlier in the podcast on besetting sins include these two.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.760]   I'll give you the titles.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.080]   The first one is "Our Deepest Prayer," which was preached on January 9, 2011, and the second
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.520]   one is "I Act the Miracle," which was preached at Bethlehem College and Seminary Chapel on
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.440]   February 24, 2011.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.160]   Both recordings are available for free at DesiringGod.org, and there you will find thousands
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.480]   of other free books, articles, sermons, and other resources from John Piper.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.360]   Thanks for listening.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.860]   [END]
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.860]   1.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.860]   John Piper's "I Act the Miracle" is a book that was published by the New York Times in
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.860]   1932.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.860]   It is about the great sin of the Christian faith.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.860]   It is about the great sin of the Christian faith.
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.860]   It is about the great sin of the Christian faith.
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.860]   It is about the great sin of the Christian faith.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.860]   It is about the great sin of the Christian faith.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.860]   It is about the great sin of the Christian faith.
