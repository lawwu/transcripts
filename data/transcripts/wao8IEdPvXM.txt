[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620]   You're so worried about not offending someone or not hurting someone's feelings that you
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.860]   fail to tell them something they'd be better off knowing in the long run.
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.660]   And that is what I call ruinous empathy.
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.140]   And if there's one big reason why I wrote Radical Candor, it's to help us all be less
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.940]   ruinously empathetic, because it's not a good thing.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.900]   It feels nice, but it's actually mean in the long run.

[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.260]   I grew up in the South, and there's this anecdote about someone went to finishing school, and
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.740]   they were taught to say, "How nice," instead of "F you."
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.460]   And that's really, you know, what's, what's going on often when people are being too nice.
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.900]   Not intentionally, but sort of unintentionally, you hurt people with that kind of ruinous
