[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860]   The following is a conversation with Ryan Hall,
[00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.460]   one of the most insightful minds and systems thinkers
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.000]   in the martial arts world.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   He's a black belt in jiu-jitsu, accomplished competitor,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.120]   an MMA fighter undefeated in the UFC,
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.880]   and truly a philosopher who seeks to understand
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.760]   the underlying principles of the martial arts.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.280]   Jiu-jitsu is such an important part of who I am,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.880]   and I was hoping to share that with folks
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.640]   who might know me only as a researcher.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.920]   I think there is no better person to do that with
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.920]   than Ryan, who somehow, remarkably, I can say is a friend,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.080]   and also a modern day warrior philosopher
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.000]   of the Miyamoto Musashi line,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.680]   of especially dangerous and brilliant humans.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.480]   Also, his amazing wife, Jen Hall, was there as well,
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.600]   so if you hear a kind of voice of wisdom coming from above,
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.780]   you know who it is.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.360]   Quick summary of the sponsors,
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.120]   PowerDot, Babbel, and Cash App.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.080]   Please check out the sponsors in the description
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.960]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.520]   As a side note, let me say that renaming this podcast
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.320]   to just my name gave me intellectual freedom
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.120]   that I really didn't anticipate was so empowering,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.240]   especially for someone who's trying to find their voice.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.080]   I hope you'll allow me the chance to really try and do that,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.560]   to step outside of AI, and even science, engineering,
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.680]   history, and so on, and on occasion,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.120]   talk to athletes, musicians, writers,
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.720]   and maybe even comedians who inspire me,
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.400]   especially up-and-coming comedians and musicians
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.800]   like Eric Weinstein,
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.280]   who, yes, we'll do a third conversation with soon.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.480]   I think if I allow myself to expand the range
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.600]   of these conversations on occasion,
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.440]   when I do return to science and engineering,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.200]   I'll bring a new perspective,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.720]   and also a little bit more fun,
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.080]   and a few extra listeners that may not otherwise realize
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.320]   how fascinating artificial intelligence, robotics,
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.840]   mathematics, and engineering truly is.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.440]   All that said, please skip the episodes
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.480]   that don't interest you.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.800]   You don't have to listen to all of them.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.120]   Trust me, as someone who is a bit or a lot OCD,
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.120]   that idea is quite unpleasant.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.600]   But life, friends, is full of unpleasant things.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.480]   But as Hunter S. Thompson suggested,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.000]   and I suggest as well,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.480]   you should still buy the ticket and take the ride.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.400]   If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.440]   review it with Five Stars on Apple Podcasts,
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.840]   follow on Spotify, support it on Patreon,
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.640]   or connect with me on Twitter @LexFriedman.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.720]   As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.080]   and no ads in the middle.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.820]   I try to make these interesting,
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.040]   but I give you the timestamp,
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.880]   so please skip if you don't wanna listen to the ads,
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.840]   but it does mean a lot to me when you do.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.540]   And still, please do check out the sponsors
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.620]   by clicking on the links in the description.
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.760]   It really is the best way to support this podcast.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.080]   This show is sponsored by PowerDot.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.200]   Get it at PowerDot.com/Lex,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.440]   and use code Lex at checkout to get 20% off.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.100]   I use it for muscle recovery for legs and shoulders,
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.760]   but you can also use it to build muscle,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.240]   endurance, or even just warmup.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.480]   In fact, I first heard about this kind of
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.800]   electrical muscle stimulation device
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.000]   in reading that Bruce Lee used it.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.120]   He was an inspiration to me
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.700]   as someone who practices first principles thinking,
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.780]   especially in a discipline
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.140]   where conventional thinking is everywhere.
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.280]   He created a martial art called Jeet Kune Do
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.040]   that is in many ways,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.440]   at least philosophically in his hybrid approach,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.380]   a precursor to modern day mixed martial arts.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.860]   There's a special kind of deep philosophical thinking
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.100]   that combat athletes or jiu-jitsu practitioners do
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.480]   that is unlike any other.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.500]   I think it's grounded in the humbling process
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.980]   of getting your ass kicked a lot.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.100]   That removes any illusion of intellectual superiority.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.840]   I think the journey towards wisdom
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.440]   starts when you humbly admit to yourself
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.920]   that you know very little or almost nothing.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.340]   Anyway, go to PowerDot.com/Lex
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.540]   and use code Lex at checkout to get 20% off
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.300]   on top of the 30 day free trial.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.660]   This show is also sponsored by Babbel,
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.860]   an app and website that gets you speaking
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.020]   in a new language within weeks.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.960]   Go to Babbel.com and use code Lex to get three months free.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.000]   They offer 14 languages, including Spanish, French,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.220]   Italian, German, and yes, Russian.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.500]   Let me read a few lines from a Russian song
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.180]   by Vladimir Vysotsky called "Ona Bala V Parizha."
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.320]   You'll start to understand if you sign up to Babbel.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:46.920]   This song always made me smile
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.940]   'cause it resonates with my own life.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.460]   It translates loosely to "She's Been to Paris."
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.940]   Paris for Russian, I suppose, symbolizing a fancy life
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.500]   and that the guy can never quite fit
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.880]   into that kind of life.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.060]   Expensive things, nice restaurants, cars, all of that.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.840]   I was thinking about what song is equivalent in English.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.780]   Maybe "Uptown Girl" by Billy Joel is similar in spirit,
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.260]   but very different in style.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.700]   I just watched a video on YouTube for "Uptown Girl"
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.080]   and it's basically Billy Joel dressed up as a mechanic,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.220]   but dancing in a way that I'm pretty sure
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.520]   no mechanic has ever danced,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.320]   turning the old cringe factor up to 11.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.680]   Anyway, I always felt like I didn't really fit in
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.720]   with the fancy people,
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.880]   and that's what this song represents.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.360]   But back to Babbel.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.560]   Get started by visiting babbel.com
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.460]   and use code Lex to get three months free.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.000]   This show is presented by the great, the powerful,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.020]   the OG sponsor, named unofficially
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.920]   after one of my favorite musicians,
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.240]   the man in black, Johnny Cash.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.400]   That's Cash App,
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.600]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.320]   When you get it, use code LexPodcast.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.240]   The Cash App folks are truly amazing people
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.000]   and are teeming with ideas for cool contests,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.480]   giveaways, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.080]   I've been thinking of doing some kind of little contest
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.720]   and giving away 42 bucks to a bunch of people who win.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.960]   It's not so much about the money,
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.500]   but the glory and a delicious taste of victory.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.960]   If you have ideas for a contest, let me know.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.880]   I was thinking of something like asking people
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.260]   to submit funny, inspiring photos or videos or audio
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.760]   of using Cash App
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.860]   or any of the sponsors of this podcast, really,
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.100]   or maybe even just funny things related to the podcast,
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.000]   like different weird places you might be watching
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.120]   or listening to me right now.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.020]   I'm pretty sure there's somebody out there right now
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.040]   sitting in a hot tub with some wine, watching me say this.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.120]   "I salute you, sir or madam."
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.800]   I may be opening up some floodgates I deeply regret later,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.040]   so please make sure you're wearing clothes
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.360]   in whatever you sent me.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.300]   There'll be no naked people in the hot tub
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.180]   as part of this podcast.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.800]   I have integrity and standards.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   Let me know in the comments
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.600]   what ideas for contests you might have.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.440]   Again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.500]   and use the code LEXPODCAST, you get $10,
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.460]   and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.380]   an organization that is helping to advance robotics
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.900]   and STEM education for young people around the world.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.500]   And now, here's my conversation with Ryan Hall.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.620]   Who, in your view, is the greatest warrior in history,
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.180]   ancient or modern?
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.220]   - That's a tough question,
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.540]   and again, I'm no historian by any measure,
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.980]   so I'll probably do the worst.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.220]   It's like, "What are your best bands ever?"
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.720]   I'm like, "Metallica," and so I'll pick the--
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.580]   - Metallica just came out with a new album, by the way,
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.760]   with an entire orchestra.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.600]   - That's kinda cool.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.420]   That's important.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.520]   - Metallica will always be one of the greatest,
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.320]   so I agree with you. - Yeah, they were a bad example.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.040]   They were a well-known yet awesome band.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.960]   Let me say Nickelback or something like that,
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.240]   but that feels cheap
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.920]   because everyone makes fun of Nickelback.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.240]   I don't know, I guess it depends
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.800]   on how you wanna define warrior.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.120]   Something that I think about
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.440]   when it comes to trying to evaluate
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.480]   various people or situations
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.240]   or things that I've read about or heard about
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.800]   are the circumstances that they were involved in
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.400]   because I think a lot of times
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.040]   it's easy to look at the outcomes,
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.000]   and obviously we live in an outcome-driven world
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.600]   and outcomes do matter,
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.680]   but at the same time, you look at,
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.720]   let's say what Cuba's been able to pull off
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.160]   from a combat sports perspective.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.680]   It's staggering,
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.760]   the amount of successful Olympic-level competitors
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.600]   they have in wrestling, boxing, judo.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.200]   I mean, they're a tiny little island
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.680]   with no money and no people.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.000]   That's shocking.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.760]   When you think about the Olympics
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.800]   and the United States doing well,
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   of course we should do well.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.560]   I mean, Russia should do well, China should do well.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.800]   India should do better than they do, honestly.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.520]   Obviously it means they're not into it as much,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.760]   or at least certain sports,
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.000]   because they have the resources people-wise.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.940]   So talent's not gonna be an issue.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.120]   - So there's something to where the starting point is.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.760]   That's the argument with why people say Maradona.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.520]   I don't know if you're into soccer.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.720]   - Okay.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.160]   - They say Maradona is better than Messi
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.320]   because he basically carried the team
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.680]   and won the World Cup
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.040]   with a team that wouldn't otherwise win the World Cup.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.960]   And then Messi was only successful in Barcelona
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.680]   because he has superstars.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.360]   He's playing with other superstars.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.180]   - Right.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.320]   Yeah, that's fair to say.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.160]   I mean, like you know,
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.680]   there's a lot of factors that go into,
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.360]   let's say, winning a soccer game.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.960]   And obviously Barcelona,
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.400]   particularly for various points in time,
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.680]   had a ridiculous all-star squad of world-class players.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.040]   But, and let's say for instance,
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.160]   maybe they didn't have the creative players in Argentina.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.760]   They needed to get the ball up to Messi.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.960]   You know, they didn't have like the NES,
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.200]   and again, the backing there in the midfield.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.000]   But, because obviously Argentina's always had
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.280]   ridiculous attacking players,
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.320]   like even alongside Messi,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.120]   but they're like the three killers up front
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.640]   and then a little less behind.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.920]   - So it's interesting you say that,
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.160]   depends how you define warrior,
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.920]   'cause you could probably take like
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.720]   some of the civil rights leaders.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.120]   You can go into that direction,
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.400]   like leaders in general.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.680]   But if we just look at like
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.800]   the greatest martial artists in history in that direction,
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.720]   do you have somebody in mind?
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.200]   - I would say at least three.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.960]   Three that pop into my head would be Hannibal,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.920]   Alexander the Great,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   and then maybe Miyamoto Musashi.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.600]   You know, the two commanders and then one guy.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.280]   But, so it's interesting.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.760]   And then again, you mentioned warriors
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.400]   being able to make a lot out of a little.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.640]   Musashi's famous for winning duels,
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.840]   you know, that were oftentimes one on one.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.440]   You know, the Alexander and Hannibal
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.760]   were military commanders and one of them faced Rome.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.280]   And that was an interesting thing.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.600]   Oftentimes, you know, coming up with novel tactics,
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.680]   different strategies, sometimes under resourced,
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.520]   doing, having to do novel and crazy things.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.760]   There's skin in the game.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.840]   That's an interesting thing too.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.840]   I think a lot of times, you know, it's a,
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.800]   if you're playing a video game,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.920]   I don't think you can be a warrior
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.760]   because there's no skin in the game.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.920]   You get hurt, you lose, and it's a bummer.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.840]   It stings a little bit.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.800]   Maybe it makes you feel slightly disappointed,
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.760]   but you know, Musashi loses, he loses.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.160]   Hannibal loses, he loses.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.360]   Alexander loses, he loses.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.080]   And they lose, I guess the people around them lose.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.720]   So that's almost like you could use,
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.520]   even from a combat sports perspective,
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.280]   Muhammad Ali, I mean, you consider also
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.800]   their quality of opposition.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.920]   Musashi was fighting high quality opposition.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.320]   Obviously Hannibal and Alexander, particularly Hannibal,
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.280]   were fighting unbelievable opposition.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.200]   Muhammad Ali fought phenomenal opposition,
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.240]   but he had skin in the game, both in the ring and out.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.320]   And that actually meshes with, as you mentioned,
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.320]   like a civil rights type of situation
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.960]   where you are under-resourced,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.000]   you're pushing the stone uphill.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.720]   And that was a neat thing, I think,
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.360]   about Muhammad Ali was how much personal conviction
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.720]   the man had to have in order to pull off
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.560]   what he was able to pull off,
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.640]   both in and outside of the ring.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.680]   And that reminds me of, again,
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.600]   some of the other great leaders
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.880]   or great fighters throughout history.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.400]   - So what do you make of the kind of very difficult idea
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.640]   that some of these conquerors like Alexander the Great
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.920]   and somebody that, if you listen to hardcore history,
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.000]   Oden Carlin, who apparently Elon Musk
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.440]   is also a big fan of, is the Genghis Khan episode.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:14.400]   A large percent of the world
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:20.160]   can call Genghis Khan an ancestor.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.240]   So the difficult truth is about some of these conquerors
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.920]   is that there's a lot of murder and rape and pillage
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.240]   and stealing of resources and all that kind of stuff.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.120]   And yet they're often remembered as quite honorable.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.600]   I mean, in the case of Genghis Khan,
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.960]   there's a lot of people who argue,
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.120]   if you look at historically the way it's described
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.340]   in full context, is he was ultimately,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.320]   given the time, he was a liberator.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.020]   He was a progressive, I should say.
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:02.280]   In terms of the violence and the atrocities he committed,
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.440]   he, at least in the stories,
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.840]   has always provided the option of not to do that.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.320]   It's only if you resist do,
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.400]   so you basically have the option,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   do you wanna join us or do you want to die and die horribly?
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.840]   - Yeah, so that's the progressive sort of,
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.520]   that's the Bernie Sanders of the era.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.520]   - Nice.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.240]   - So what do you make of that?
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.620]   That there's so much of these great conquerors,
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:32.620]   there's so much murder that to us now would just seem insane.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.400]   - It's funny you mentioned it.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.240]   I think that maybe it's a human nature thing
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.000]   that we want to, or maybe a misunderstanding thing
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.260]   that we want to cast all of our characters and ourselves
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.520]   maybe as entirely good or as entirely negative
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.680]   when I guess the phrase or the saying,
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.140]   one man's freedom fighter is another person's terrorist,
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.400]   is accurate.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.700]   And a lot of times I think you can understand
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.440]   as long as you're able to look
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.760]   from various people's perspective.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.200]   Like if you look at the TV show "The Wire,"
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.520]   which was obviously widely, everybody loves "The Wire."
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.040]   I thought that there were, everyone,
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   I'm not saying anything that's not been said before,
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.400]   compelling characters from all angles,
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.640]   whether you like the character, dislike the character,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.220]   you were able to understand the motivations
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.300]   of people doing various things.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.160]   Even if they did wrongly, they did rightly.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.740]   We want to cast all of the demons throughout history
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.060]   as completely inhuman when I think that makes it difficult
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.980]   for us to understand them.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.580]   And we want to look back at the people
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.940]   that we think of as great and entirely great.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.220]   And I think that we're experiencing the problems with this,
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.820]   even right now, socially and politically
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.180]   is we're trying to look back and decide
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.620]   the people we thought were good or not good,
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.440]   or people we thought were bad are now good,
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.540]   rather than going, "Hey, there's good and bad to all things.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.740]   And there are, as you mentioned, the Genghis Khan thing.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.240]   You don't have to fight back."
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.560]   You do, I respect you for it,
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.900]   but then we're gonna have a conflict
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.300]   and then we'll see what happens.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.020]   And if you lose, you're gonna be sorry that you did
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.780]   because I have to make it that way
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.580]   if I want to continue utilizing this kind of MO
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.300]   because I need to discourage the next guy
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.320]   from doing what you're doing right now.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.040]   And ultimately though,
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.220]   I guess that's an interesting thing.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.860]   Imagine you put every single person
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.720]   on planet earth in a cage, crime drops.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.540]   Also, there are certain positives to that.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.100]   And it's just things are as they are, it's difficult,
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.120]   but that is ultimately more the law of the jungle.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.880]   And I think that we're able to supersede some of that now
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.140]   in modern times, and I think we're fortunate.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.180]   But as you mentioned, we look back and say,
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.460]   "Oh, this is horrible."
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.600]   Say, "No, that just is what it is.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.980]   That's how life is at a base level."
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.420]   And again, if you're a lion and I'm a gazelle,
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.380]   I don't really like it very much,
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.860]   but we don't call the lion the bad guy.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.820]   We don't sanctify the gazelle or the other way around.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.100]   So it's interesting when you pull back some of the controls
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.540]   that we put on our behavior and in modern life,
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.020]   which I think are generally speaking positive,
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.140]   we get down to how things often are.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.060]   And at the same time,
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.620]   modern life was built by people like Genghis Khan.
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.540]   So then you get down to the ends justifying the means.
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.380]   It's a tough question.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.220]   These aren't things with easy answers, or at least if they
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.540]   are, I certainly don't have the smarts to figure out
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.020]   the answers to them, but it's difficult.
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.100]   I would just say people in the world are complicated
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.100]   and layered, and depending upon which side of the line
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.900]   you're standing on at various times,
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.700]   you may like or dislike someone.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.500]   But I can't remember whose idea it was,
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.140]   this is killing me, but it's the veil of ignorance,
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.740]   I guess, the philosophical idea of the veil of ignorance
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.540]   where I go, "Is sticking everyone in the cage
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.860]   the right thing to do?"
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.660]   And I say, or everyone but me, and I say, "Well, no, why?"
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.500]   "Well, it would make my life easier if I just went over
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.020]   and took all of your stuff as long as you couldn't stop me."
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.100]   I mean, of course, that's a great idea.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.780]   That's what everyone does in every video game.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.740]   But in Skyrim, you steal stuff when people aren't around.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.180]   But ultimately you go, "Well, this isn't the right thing
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.300]   to do because if I were on the other side of it,
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.100]   I would not appreciate it.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.900]   It's inherently not a good thing to do.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.100]   I'm only doing it because I think I'm gonna win."
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.740]   And that's a fine way to be, but you don't have
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.100]   the white hat on, I guess I would say.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.540]   So I think without those philosophical underpinnings
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.480]   to rein us in, I guess morally speaking,
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.780]   it's very difficult to say what's right or wrong.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.420]   And you'd say certain actions have a reaction,
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.040]   almost like a physics sense.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.280]   If you kill everyone in your way for as long as you're able
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.980]   to, your life will be easier.
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.380]   I mean, you're setting the table for someone doing the same
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.780]   to you when you're no longer the tough guy,
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.040]   but it is what it is.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.020]   - Yeah, if you look at the Instagram channel,
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.940]   Nature is Metal, it hurts my heart to watch,
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.700]   to remind me, a comfortable descendant of ape,
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.500]   how vicious nature is, just unapologetically,
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:55.220]   just, I mean, there's a process to it
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.460]   where the bad guy always wins.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:04.340]   The violence is the solution to most problems
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.660]   or the flip side of that, running away from violence
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.340]   is the solution, depending on your skillset.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.800]   And it's funny to think of us humans
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.160]   with our extra little piece of brain
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.360]   that we're somehow trying to figure out,
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.860]   like you said, in a philosophical way,
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.180]   how to supersede that, how to move past the viciousness,
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:28.180]   the cruelty, just the cold exchange of nature.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.660]   But perhaps it's not so.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.900]   Maybe that is nature, maybe that's the way of life.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.640]   Maybe we're trying too hard to,
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.780]   we're being too egotistical
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.580]   and thinking we're somehow separate from nature,
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.620]   we're somehow distant from that very thing.
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.700]   - I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.740]   In fact, I think actually Orson Scott Card,
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.500]   who's the writer of a great book called "Ender's Game,"
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.860]   this was a statement that the main character, Ender,
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.460]   made in the book, his brother was brilliant.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.340]   His brother was like kind of sociopathic, brilliant kid
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.860]   that was ended up kicked out of the school
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.140]   that they were all into for battle commander.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.420]   Dealing with his brother taught him
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.400]   that ultimately strength, courage,
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.980]   the ability to do violence,
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.420]   for all the good and the bad of that,
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.980]   is one of the fundamental, most important things
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.940]   to be able to do in life,
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.520]   because if you can't cause destruction,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.940]   if you can't cause pain,
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.180]   you will be forever subject to those who can.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.140]   And I think that you mentioned egotism.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.660]   I think that that's a disease
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.460]   that could obviously strike any of us,
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.780]   but it's something that we're looking at now.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.220]   We're, you know, I think we should be unbelievably thankful
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.700]   as people that live in the world that we do,
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.140]   that we can walk down the street
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.860]   without having to worry that I'm like,
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.620]   "Well, don't worry, that six foot six,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.860]   "270 pound person over there is just gonna leave me alone.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.040]   "And I have a Rolex on, but whatever, I'll be fine,
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.140]   "because that person is deciding to leave me alone,
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.040]   "because we've all agreed to live in this relatively,
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.900]   "you know, sane and or, you know, constrained society,
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.000]   "because it benefits all of us.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.060]   "And we're doing it because of a philosophical underpinning,
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.880]   "not because nature dictates it be that way,
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.220]   "because nature dictates it go
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.500]   "in a very, very different direction.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.560]   "And the only person, the only thing stopping that person
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.660]   "from doing something to me is either me, that person,
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.860]   "or someone else that will stand in between us.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.320]   "And if I can't do it,
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.960]   "and there's no one there to stand in between us,
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.980]   "then the only thing stopping that person is that person."
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.460]   And I have to hope that they're either disinterested
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.700]   or disinclined to do that sort of thing.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.140]   And I think that, you know, it's keeping in mind
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.260]   that that is the fundamental nature of the world,
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.880]   whether we like it or not, is important.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.060]   And I think the quest to fundamentally alter human nature
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.620]   is gonna be ultimately fruitless.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.020]   And then also it's, it is a little bit egotistical.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.060]   A lion does what a lion does, you know,
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.100]   we can try to box it in and we can try to, you know,
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.740]   guide this direction, that direction,
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.620]   but, you know, nature is as it is,
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.620]   and as it always will be,
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.820]   unless we wanna start to constrain it significantly.
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.580]   But now I'm starting to get into individual rights,
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.700]   who put me in charge?
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.820]   Who says that I should be the one
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.000]   to make the choices constraining?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.780]   Because many of the most awful things
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.340]   that have happened throughout history,
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.780]   one group or one person has decided to constrain others.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.060]   And we don't like Genghis Khan doing that?
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.240]   Well, I'll do that on a little level.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.700]   Are there gonna be benefits and beneficiaries?
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.060]   Absolutely, but there'll be losers in that too.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.500]   So I guess it's a dangerous game.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.940]   It's almost like putting on the one ring.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.060]   You know, we remember when Frodo
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.860]   offered the one ring to Gandalf,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.220]   and Gandalf said, "No, no, I would take it away.
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.320]   "I would put it on.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.360]   "I would use it out of the desire to do good.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.180]   "But through me, it would wield a power
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.020]   "so terrible you can't imagine."
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.220]   I think that's the big question for anyone
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.020]   that decides that's able to have reach
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.140]   and able to have power.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.180]   I mean, obviously I can't speak to that,
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.860]   but imagine you did have national level,
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.340]   global level power.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.300]   How would you use it?
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.480]   Would you try to change the world?
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.420]   Would you be glad that you did down the line?
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.820]   I don't know.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.980]   - Yeah, there's a, I mean,
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.940]   that's the thing we're struggling now as a society.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.540]   Maybe it'd be nice to get your quick comment on that,
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:00.380]   which is the people who have traditionally been powerless
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.100]   are now, you know, seeking a fairer society,
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.640]   a more equal society.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.640]   And in attaining more power justly,
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.900]   there's also a realization, at least from my perspective,
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.820]   that power corrupts everyone.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:24.300]   Even if you're, even if the flag you wave
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.580]   is that of justice, right?
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.380]   And so, you know, not to overuse the term,
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.060]   but it'd be nice if you have thoughts
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.980]   about the whole idea of cancel culture and the internet
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.020]   and Twitter and so on,
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.500]   where there's nuanced, difficult discussions
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.500]   of race, of gender, of fairness,
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.380]   equality, justice, all of these kinds of things.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.300]   There's a shouting down, oftentimes,
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:01.300]   of nuanced discussion of kind of trying to reason
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.940]   through these very difficult issues,
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.580]   through our history, through what our future looks like.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.300]   Do you have thoughts about the internet discourse
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.580]   that's going on now?
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.420]   Is there something positive?
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.540]   - Yeah, I mean-- - That we can pull out of this?
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.300]   - It's an interesting thing to see, I guess.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.980]   As you mentioned, any time you're wielding power,
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.940]   whomever you are, doing so carefully is important.
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.420]   And it's very, very easy to look at the people
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.380]   that have power and that are using it poorly,
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.420]   or have used it poorly, and go, "Hey, you're the bad guy."
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.540]   And then go, "Well, of course, if I had power,
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.200]   "I'll use it properly, and I may intend to use it properly,
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.500]   "and maybe I will."
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:44.140]   But at the same time, we see a lot of times,
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.480]   people are people are people.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.480]   I think that a lot of the, I think if you believe
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.980]   that human beings are all one, which I do,
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.020]   no matter whether you're here or you're there,
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.380]   you got two arms, two legs, a heart, a brain,
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.940]   we all live a similar experience.
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.140]   And obviously, we have variations on a theme.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.240]   But you're no less a human being,
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.340]   if you're a person I've never met from China,
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.100]   than some person in Virginia.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.780]   It's, we're all people.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.460]   And I guess, ultimately, if I believe
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.980]   that human beings are corruptible, and that power corrupts,
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.440]   and that we're all fallible, and we say and do things
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.420]   that either intentionally or unintentionally,
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.420]   that we wish we'd not, I think that I have to allow
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.300]   for a space, I guess, with the word,
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.380]   it's almost a religious term,
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.740]   but I guess I would just say grace.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.480]   And that's something that I see disappearing
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.600]   from discourse in the public, or maybe it wasn't there,
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.420]   I'm not sure, but it's interesting,
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.180]   watching this occur on the internet,
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.660]   because also now, no longer are you and I
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.740]   just having a talk sitting on a bus stop,
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.340]   it's now in writing, everything's in writing.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.500]   The old saying, like, don't put that in writing.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.700]   You're like, don't put anything in writing,
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.680]   that's how you get in trouble.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.700]   And basically, with the degree
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.980]   to which everything is recorded,
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.480]   but recorded in tiny little bites,
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.220]   it's very, very easy for me to waive
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.020]   every last little foolish, ignorant, incorrect,
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.580]   or correct thing that someone has ever said or done
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.980]   in their face to support whatever argument
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.600]   that I'm trying to make about them, or a situation.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.940]   And I think that you mentioned cancel culture,
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.460]   or as it seems to exist, obviously this is poisonous,
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.740]   on its face this is poisonous.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.840]   It's the sort of thing that doesn't
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.940]   incentivize proper behavior.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.300]   I mean, you look at, let's say,
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.100]   one of the great monsters of history, Adolf Hitler,
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.220]   obviously, who's done awful, awful things,
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.800]   but also for anyone that's even a minor student of history,
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.780]   did some positive things as well.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.900]   We don't have to, I don't have to
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.500]   embroider this person's crimes,
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.900]   I don't have to act as if there was nothing good
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.920]   a monster has ever done, and nothing bad
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.720]   that a great person throughout history has ever done.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.340]   But imagine the ghost of Adolf Hitler were to pop up
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.580]   and go, "Oh my gosh, guys, I'm so sorry.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.260]   "I know what I've done, but I'd like to apologize
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.020]   "and start to make it right."
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.460]   Well, I mean, you'd hope that,
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.540]   if he popped up over here, you'd go,
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.540]   "Well, I don't really like what you've done,
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.340]   "and I don't like you, but at the same time,
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.020]   "I'm glad to hear that you're attempting
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.120]   "to make this right and push in a positive direction,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.500]   "even if you can't make it right."
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.140]   Because otherwise, what am I doing?
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.580]   I'm disincentivizing change for the better.
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.940]   I'm looking to wield whatever power I have
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.820]   in a punitive fashion, which does not encourage people
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.660]   to do anything other than double down
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.340]   on the wrongs that they've made,
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.520]   knowing that at least they're gonna have some support
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.360]   from the people that support that.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.820]   And I guess I want to, you would hopefully
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.780]   look at the use of the internet as a tool that can educate,
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.200]   and I guess, I don't like the word empower,
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.320]   but empower people to do various things,
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.620]   extend their reach, but educate and learn,
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:43.200]   rather than to further solidify little tribal things
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.700]   that exist, which I think everyone in humanity
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.460]   and human history is vulnerable to.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.020]   I mean, look at the course of human history.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.340]   It's deeply tribal.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.140]   And the tribes or the groups that have been on top
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.100]   at various points in time have done,
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.000]   a lot of times, bad things to the ones that have not.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.380]   And you'd hope that we could learn lessons from the past,
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.100]   and rather than committing the crimes
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.940]   that were committed against us,
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.420]   recommit in them when we slide into the top position,
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.220]   say, "I could do this now, but I'll not."
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.220]   I understand the urge to seek vengeance is strong.
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.260]   Anyone that says differently, I wouldn't trust.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.100]   But at the same time, we go,
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.980]   we have enough experience in history,
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.960]   enough experience in life, enough, hopefully, wisdom,
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.860]   time in to go, "This isn't the right answer.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.860]   This is only gonna replay the things,
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.020]   the worst parts of our history, not the best."
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.620]   And I want to encourage positive behavior.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.420]   And if I just, again, further lash out at people,
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.420]   although understandably, done understandably,
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.820]   I'm simply just gonna just perpetuate the cycle
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.180]   that's gone on to this point.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.020]   So you hope that even though we're seeing
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.820]   a lot of turmoil societally at the moment
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.140]   and globally at the moment,
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.780]   that I guess our better angels can prevail
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.700]   at a certain point.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.500]   But it's gonna take a great deal of leadership.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.080]   And I think that we're sorely missing
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.220]   like a Martin Luther King-style character at the moment
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.100]   or a great leader.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:05.100]   And I just, I'm hoping that one will show up.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.940]   - For sure.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.100]   And by the way, a word I don't hear often,
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.700]   and I think it's a beautiful one, which is grace.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.820]   That's a really interesting word.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.860]   I'm gonna have to think about that.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.420]   There is a religious component to it,
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.260]   but it's exactly right.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:22.420]   You have to somehow walk the line between,
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.020]   you know, you mentioned Hitler.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.620]   I've been reading "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.940]   I'm really thinking about the 1930s
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:36.980]   and what it's like to have economic...
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.100]   My concern is the economic pain
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.360]   that people are feeling now quietly
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.460]   is really a suffering that's not being heard.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.620]   And there's echoes of that in the '20s and the '30s
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.420]   with the Great Depression.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.460]   And there's a hunger for a charismatic leader.
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.700]   Like you said, there's a leader
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.340]   that could walk with grace, could inspire,
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.900]   could bring people together
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.900]   with sort of dreams of a better future that's positive.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.960]   But Hitler did exactly everything that I just said,
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.740]   except for the word positive,
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.820]   which is he did give a dream to the German people
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:20.940]   who were great people,
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.940]   who are great people of a better future.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.300]   It's just that a certain point
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.660]   that quickly turned into the better future
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.620]   requires literally expansion of more land.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.140]   It started with, well, if we wanna build a great Germany,
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.340]   we need a little bit more land.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.980]   And so we need to kind of get Austria,
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.320]   then we need to kind of get France,
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.260]   mostly because France doesn't understand
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.580]   that more land is really useful,
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.700]   so we need to get rid of them.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.200]   - And look what they did to us in Versailles anyway.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:07.060]   - But so the Jewish, the Holocaust is a separate thing.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.100]   I don't know.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.140]   Well, I don't know.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:13.980]   I don't know what to think of it
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.540]   because to me being Jewish and having a lot of,
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:22.620]   the echoes of the suffering is in my family,
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.060]   of the people that are lost.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.540]   I don't know because Hitler wrote all about it in "Mein Kampf,"
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.940]   so I don't know if the evil he committed
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.940]   was there all along.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.860]   I mean, and that's where the question of forgiveness,
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.060]   I mean, Hitler is such a difficult person to talk about,
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.580]   but it's the question of,
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:46.540]   cancel culture, who is deserving of forgiveness
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.000]   and who is not?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.540]   Like the Holocaust survivors that I've read about,
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.500]   that I've heard the interviews with,
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.340]   they've often spoken about the fact that
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.940]   the way for them to let go,
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.940]   to overcome the atrocities that they've experienced
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.360]   is to forgive.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:11.540]   Like forgiveness is the way out for them.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.320]   It's interesting to think about.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.160]   I don't know.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.380]   I don't know if we're even as a society
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:20.700]   ready to even contemplate an idea of forgiveness for Hitler.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.300]   It's an interesting idea though.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.020]   It's a good thought exercise at the very least
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.500]   to think about all these people that are being canceled
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.820]   for doing bad things of different degrees.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.380]   Think of like Louis C.K. or somebody like that
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.540]   for being not a good person,
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.100]   but what is the path for forgiveness?
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.660]   - And also what's a good person?
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.740]   - What is a good person?
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.340]   - If that's a sliding scale
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.900]   that we could all find ourselves looking at
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.340]   the uncomfortable end of a gun on,
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.460]   particularly down the line,
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.460]   I mean, you hope for the best,
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.740]   but these definitions, I guess, like you said,
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.700]   are important and who's doing the canceling,
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:58.780]   who's being canceled.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.060]   I'm not necessarily, as you said,
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.660]   saying that that's entirely unjustified
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.100]   or certainly not, it's certainly understandable.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.900]   And particularly you mentioned like a monster,
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.020]   like an Adolf Hitler, but it's also interesting.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.140]   I couldn't help but notice, like you mentioned,
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.260]   as a society, us being able to apply forgiveness
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.300]   to someone who's done so much horror,
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.620]   but people who are personal,
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.460]   I mean, of course, many,
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.600]   so many people have been personally affected,
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.060]   but directly personally affected,
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.140]   someone, a survivor of the Holocaust,
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.760]   being able to let go on that,
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.420]   I'm nowhere near big enough a person
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.620]   for that sort of thing.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.700]   But I guess that's an interesting thing,
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.980]   the person who was physically there
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.500]   potentially able to let go.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.300]   I don't know, that's unbelievably powerful.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.140]   It's interesting.
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.900]   I guess you have to wonder sometimes,
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.540]   and this isn't obviously in regards to the Holocaust,
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.820]   but why I'm holding on to various things.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.900]   Why, what is it doing for me?
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.380]   And what is it doing to me?
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.300]   Is it facilitative?
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.140]   Is it not?
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.620]   And I guess that's something else that I really enjoy.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.940]   When I was on "Ultimate Fighter,"
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.220]   they don't let you have any music or any books
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.060]   other than religious texts.
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.540]   So I brought a Bible and I brought a Quran,
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.740]   and I started to read them side by side.
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.500]   And it was really interesting reading.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.580]   The Bible's a little drier,
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.620]   Quran's more interesting, at least written.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:16.060]   But I think something that was consistently brought up
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.940]   was the way, most merciful.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.460]   People want, I don't think any of us want justice.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.180]   We think we want justice,
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.260]   but I don't think we want justice.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.760]   Justice is a dangerous, dangerous, dangerous game,
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.180]   because maybe this person's wronged me deeply,
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.260]   and I want justice.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.140]   I wanna balance it out,
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:32.980]   'cause what is justice
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.420]   if not a balancing of the scales?
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.500]   And sometimes you can understand it,
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.980]   and on a societal level, I think it's fine.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.420]   I mean, there's crime and punishment,
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.140]   and we can go for the benefits and the drawbacks of that.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:45.660]   But I think what all any of us want is mercy within reason.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.100]   You know, grace, as you mentioned,
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.020]   'cause justice is a very, very, very dangerous thing,
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.740]   and it's a valuable and important thing.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.060]   But who gets to decide what's just,
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.660]   what justice is actually meted out?
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.060]   Maybe I get to mete out justice,
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.780]   but I don't get my comeuppance.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.980]   Well, that sounds great.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.180]   But what happens when it's pointed back at me?
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.460]   And I guess that comes back to the veil of ignorance.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.380]   You know, the idea that one day
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.740]   I will have to live in the world in which I've envisioned,
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.220]   the world in which I've created.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.900]   I think that a lot of times people love the idea
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:18.340]   of they're a judge for your crimes and a lawyer for theirs.
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.580]   And I heard that the other day.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.740]   I thought that was great.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.460]   And I think that's a dangerous thing,
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.620]   and hopefully it gives us all pause before,
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.180]   rightly or wrongly, but always understandably,
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.180]   you know, wielding serious power.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.820]   - Yeah, justice is a kind of drug.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.580]   So if you look at history,
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.620]   also been reading a lot about Stalin.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.940]   I mean, all those folks really,
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.580]   I don't know what was inside Hitler's head, actually,
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.100]   that he's a tricky one,
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.660]   because I think he was legitimately insane.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.420]   Stalin was not.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.100]   And Stalin was like,
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.180]   he literally thought he's doing a good thing.
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.860]   He literally thought for the entirety of the time
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.940]   that communism is going to bring,
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.580]   like that's the utopia,
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:06.180]   and is going to create a happy world.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:11.180]   And in his mind were ideas of justice,
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.780]   of fairness, of happiness,
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:19.460]   of yeah, human flourishing.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.060]   And that's a drug.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.340]   And it somehow, sadly, pollutes the mind.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.660]   When you start thinking like that,
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.340]   what's good for society,
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.700]   and believing that you have a good sense
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.840]   of what's good for society,
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.340]   that's intoxicating,
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.780]   especially when others around you are feeling the same way.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.980]   And then you start like building up this movement,
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.460]   and you forget that you are just like,
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.060]   you're like barely recently evolved from an ape.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.100]   Like you don't know what the hell you're doing.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.460]   And then you start like killing witches or whatever.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.900]   Like you start-
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.380]   - They did math, let's be honest though.
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.820]   I mean, sometimes you got a witch has to go.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.940]   - Yeah, we can all agree there.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.660]   A witch has to go.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.080]   If it floats or sinks, which one?
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.060]   I forget which one it is.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.660]   - Whichever one we need at the time, honestly.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.500]   Is it floating?
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.320]   It should have sunk.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.860]   - Yeah.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.620]   Yeah, but yeah, we can definitely agree
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:10.820]   that witches have to go.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.540]   Because you brought it up,
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.740]   I tweeted recently, but also just,
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.220]   one of the things I'm really ashamed of in my life
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:24.940]   is I haven't really read almost any of the sci-fi classics.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.780]   - Really?
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.320]   - Yeah, so like my whole journey through reading
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.320]   was through like the literary philosophers, I would say,
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:38.540]   like Camus, Hesse, Dostoevsky, Kafka,
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.220]   like that place.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.340]   Like that's a kind of sci-fi world in itself,
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.380]   but it just,
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:52.260]   it creates a world in which the deepest questions
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.540]   about human nature can be explored.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:37:00.260]   I didn't realize this, but the sci-fi world is the same.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.780]   It just puts it in a,
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.020]   it like removes it from any kind of historical context
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.160]   to where you can explore those same ideas
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.860]   in like space somewhere elsewhere
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.740]   in a different time, a different place.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.460]   It allows you almost like more freedom
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.100]   to like construct these artificial things
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.780]   where you can just do crazy,
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.220]   crazy kind of human experiments.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.120]   So I'm now working through it.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.660]   The books on my list are the "Foundation" series
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.380]   by Isaac Asimov, "Dune,"
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:32.820]   "Snow Crash" by Neil Stevenson,
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.060]   and "Ender's Game," like you mentioned.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.180]   That's just kind of,
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.740]   and then, so I posted that,
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.760]   and then of course like Elon Musk, John Carmack,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.600]   I don't know if you know him,
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.900]   creator of "Doom" and "Quake."
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.820]   - Oh, cool.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.020]   - See, they all pitched in.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.980]   These nerds, these ultra nerds just started like going,
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.440]   like, "You need to read this, that," and the other.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.640]   So I've like started working out, okay.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.740]   But it seems like the list I've mentioned
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.300]   holds up somewhat.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:05.300]   Is there a book, is there sci-fi books or series
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:11.300]   or authors that you find are just amazing?
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.180]   Maybe another way to ask that is like,
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.380]   what's the greatest sci-fi book of all time?
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.980]   - Well, I'd like to start by sharing something
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.080]   that I'm embarrassed about,
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.980]   is that I haven't read anything other than, you know,
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:28.340]   Orson Scott Card, JR Tolkien, Frank Herbert, Tolkien.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.860]   - "Dune." - Yep, yep.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.260]   Yeah, I'm aware through Wikipedia
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.860]   and through surface reading of things
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.620]   that like a book called "The Republic" was written once.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.820]   There were some other, some other good ones.
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.860]   - You're a prolific reader of Wikipedia articles.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.260]   - Well. - Or occasional.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.060]   - Occasional, yeah, exactly.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.860]   In between whatever else it is that I waste my time on.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.700]   - But yeah, so I also, I should say,
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.560]   I posted on Reddit questions for Ryan Hall
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.460]   and there's like a million questions,
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.180]   but like half of them have to do with "Dune."
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.500]   No, not really, but like people bring up "Dune."
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.860]   I don't understand why, did you mention "Dune" before?
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.820]   - Well, actually, we actually have,
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.700]   Shari Roll actually made us a gi,
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.460]   a "Dune" themed gi one time,
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.500]   which I thought was kind of cool.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.340]   I'll send you one, I'll give you one, we got extras.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.900]   But actually to your point, actually,
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.700]   this is a Orson Scott Card quote,
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.700]   actually the writer of "Ender's Game."
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.220]   Fiction, because it's not about somebody
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.580]   who actually lived in the real world,
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.860]   always has the possibility of being about oneself.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.660]   And I think that's a neat thing,
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.260]   because I have heard, you know, other people whom I respect
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.380]   and very sharp people actually every now and then
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.020]   dig their heels and go, "I don't like fiction.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.220]   "I only like nonfiction, it's more instructive."
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.500]   And I would go, "I completely disagree with that."
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.340]   I think we have a hard enough time figuring out
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.420]   what happened at 7-Eleven three hours ago that,
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.940]   let me tell you what happened 600 years BC.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:48.900]   I'm like, "Hey, I'm interested,
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.900]   "but don't tell me this isn't a story too."
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.740]   There's factual components, I have no doubt,
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.020]   but we struggle sometimes to,
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.620]   like I guess what I like about fiction
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.220]   is that you can tell me a story, it's all about people.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.780]   I mean, every now there's more and less believable things.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.500]   And I think "Dune" would be an unbelievably well-written,
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.700]   in my opinion, for what do I know,
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.380]   but I really like "Dune," I'll say that,
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.620]   well-written example of human beings
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.700]   interacting with one another,
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.320]   the political component to that,
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.420]   the emotional, the intellectual,
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.980]   the relationship components to all of that.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.300]   And I think that "Dune" is neat because it's a sci-fi novel,
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.700]   but only in the loosest sense.
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:31.340]   It's really a story about religion, about group dynamics,
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:36.340]   about human potential, about belief, learning,
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.340]   politics, governance, ecology.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:44.060]   It's the best stories remind me of history,
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.460]   the same way history, hopefully,
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:49.460]   is not just a list of facts that I try to be able to recall
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.520]   or factoids that I try to recall,
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.220]   but a story that I can understand
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:58.340]   and see how the threads of time kind of came together
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.460]   and created certain things.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.520]   And a lot of times, like we say, I'm like,
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.660]   "Oh, how the heck is, what's going on right now
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.100]   "or 100 years from now or 100 years in the past happened?"
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.420]   And you can look back far enough,
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.380]   if we had accurate knowledge,
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.820]   if we had that hypothetical perfect pool shot,
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:12.780]   at the beginning of time,
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.740]   we would see an unbroken chain of events
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.260]   that led us to where we are
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.340]   and where we are will potentially lead us
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.260]   to where we're going, which is again, why hindsight's helpful.
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.540]   But I think it's neat.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.140]   I guess I really enjoy, for instance, a book like "Dune,"
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:25.740]   and they're actually making a movie out of it,
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.780]   which I'm skeptical of, to be honest,
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.460]   'cause it's gonna be difficult
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.740]   to bring that to the screen for a variety of reasons.
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.740]   - Yeah, there's at least 100 questions.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.560]   Ask Ryan, "What do you think about the new "Dune" movie?"
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.980]   - I am not enough of an authority
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.480]   to have any sort of decent opinion,
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.380]   but I guess what I would say is
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.940]   so much of it goes on in the character's mind.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.420]   Like how much of any of our day,
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.780]   any lived experience, as it were, is internal?
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.780]   The majority, how many times are people walking around
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.040]   and they can, you can be like,
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.880]   "Hey, what do you see right now?"
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.820]   I'm like, "Oh, well, I see this picture, I see a wall.
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.740]   "Hey, there's Lex."
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.140]   But really, what I was paying attention to
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.380]   was what was going on inside of my head for a moment,
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.620]   and almost the rest of the world tuned out and kind of dimmed
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:08.620]   and I guess that, I think that's gonna be a struggle
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.660]   to any time you wanna bring that type of a written story
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.040]   to a visual medium, I think it's gonna be more difficult,
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.700]   but it'll be interesting.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.340]   It's definitely one of my favorite stories,
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.540]   and it's been, it's honestly helped me become better at life
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.340]   in my opinion, better at the martial arts,
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.340]   and I think the writer, I think Frank Herbert,
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.180]   was absolutely brilliant,
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.380]   whether those were all his ideas, which in reality,
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.780]   none of us are, all of our good ideas aren't ours,
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.300]   we're a combination, maybe you came up with something,
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.680]   you're a curator of other good ideas,
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.260]   and some things you borrowed from somewhere
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.540]   without even realizing it,
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.780]   but I think the way, the messages and the themes
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.180]   and the ideas that were conveyed,
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.580]   particularly in the original novel
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.460]   are just absolutely brilliant.
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.540]   - Is that, is that to you one of the greats?
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.740]   And the flip side of that, like,
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.820]   or another way to ask that is like,
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.380]   if somebody is new to sci-fi,
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.900]   is that something you would recommend?
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.620]   That is an entry point?
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.500]   - I'm not well-read enough in the sci-fi world,
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.380]   I haven't read a lot of like Isaac Asimov
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.100]   or anything like that, but I just, I'll recommend Dune,
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.300]   I'll be an obnoxious like evangelist for Dune
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.660]   to anyone who'll listen.
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:09.500]   - Great. - So yeah,
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.500]   I would strongly recommend it.
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.660]   - So the other thing you mentioned,
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.380]   now I should probably be talking to you
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.620]   about much more important things,
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.940]   but the other thing you mentioned is Skyrim.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.340]   Do you play video games?
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.660]   What's your favorite game?
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.900]   What's, what would you say is the greatest video game
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.740]   of all time?
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.900]   I'm a huge fan of Elder Scrolls.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.740]   - Oh, cool. - Skyrim.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.740]   - Yeah, I mean, I play a little bit at this point,
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:34.100]   you know, a little less, finally moved into a new house,
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.660]   so I'm-- - So you're like an adult?
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.500]   - No, no, no, no, I'm like a better funded 12 year old.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:43.620]   Yeah, that's, yeah, that's entirely accurate,
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.980]   better funded 12 year old,
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.780]   but somewhat better funded 12 year old,
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.020]   not as well funded as I wish.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.820]   - But historically, did you play video games?
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.580]   - Oh yeah, I played as a kid and I was, you know,
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.260]   again, I've always liked playing sports and liked reading
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.620]   and I always enjoyed video games,
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.460]   but my favorite video game I think I've ever played
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.100]   was Knights of the Old Republic.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.780]   It was a Star Wars game, I'm a huge Star Wars fan
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:06.820]   until it become less so, so recently, Disney.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.740]   - You don't like the, I haven't watched it yet.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.220]   - Oh. - Mandalorian.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.340]   - Oh, oh, actually I like Mandalorian,
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.180]   that was actually pretty cool, yeah.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.860]   - Just like the waving this off, canceled.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.060]   - Yeah, I will, if I could cancel one thing,
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.300]   I would cancel Disney Star Wars.
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.420]   - I'm gonna edit that part out.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.420]   Okay, let's go to the next.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.700]   - This is where, if people are wondering,
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.420]   if you're watching this on YouTube
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.140]   and like the dislike amount is like 80%,
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.060]   it's because of that comment, so good job.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.900]   Good job for making the internet hate you.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.940]   - I regret nothing.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.180]   - Now what about Baby Yoda?
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.540]   - Yeah, I guess, yeah, he's like, he's little,
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.420]   he's got ears and he uses the force sometimes
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.500]   and he passes out, I guess, no qualms with Baby Yoda, yeah.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.100]   - You don't have a heart, okay.
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:52.580]   Let's go to Jiu Jitsu if it's okay.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.380]   So the audience of this podcast
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:59.620]   may not know much about Jiu Jitsu,
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.900]   or they do because it's really part of the culture now,
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.580]   but they don't really know much.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:07.320]   They see that so many people have fallen in love with it,
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.460]   have been transformed through it,
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.300]   but they don't know much about like, what is this thing?
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.780]   Is there a way you could sort of try to explain
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:15.980]   the what is Jiu Jitsu,
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.940]   what is the essence of this martial art
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:21.180]   that's captured the minds and hearts
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.700]   of so many people in the world?
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.780]   - I think that Jiu Jitsu is a philosophy
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.660]   that's expressed physically,
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.980]   and that it's the kind of development
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.420]   of the mental capacity and physical capacity
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:41.420]   working in unison to move efficiently
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:47.700]   and almost flowingly, unresistingly,
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.780]   with a given situation,
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.380]   with a physically resisting opponent.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.380]   Learning how to generate force on your own
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.060]   and how to steal force from the floor,
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.020]   how to steal force from the other person,
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:02.740]   and move in concert with it, as opposed to clash against,
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:05.060]   which if you watch two untrained people fight,
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.360]   it's almost entirely a clash.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.940]   It's a runaway and clash, a runaway and clash.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.700]   If you watch Jiu Jitsu done well,
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.620]   it looks like water moving around a solid structure.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.700]   And I think that that is expressed physically,
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.420]   and I think that all of the things
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.940]   that anyone has really been able to do very, very well
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.180]   in Jiu Jitsu end up kind of exemplifying that.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.500]   But I think that that's true of martial arts in general.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.420]   I think that a lot of times,
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.420]   like the clashing that we see going on
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:36.060]   and working well is just the fact that
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.020]   you get very, very physically powerful people every now
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.540]   and then they're able to get away with this.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.980]   But I don't think that that's,
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:42.980]   and that's fantastic,
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.540]   'cause ultimately it's a results-driven thing.
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.740]   But I think that the essence of the martial arts
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.220]   is learning how to make more out of less
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.900]   and how to move with and be yielding,
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.300]   almost like real-life Aikido.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:56.700]   - So you think of martial arts, Jiu Jitsu,
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:01.700]   as like water or flowing, so Aikido,
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.780]   so moving around the force,
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:11.100]   as opposed to sort of maybe the wrestling mindset
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.740]   is finding a leverage where you can apply
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.180]   an exceptional amount of force.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.700]   So like maximizing the application of force.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.100]   - I guess maybe that's a better way to,
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.940]   I'd like to marry the two ideas,
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.780]   because I think you flow until the point
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.180]   at which you are the greater force,
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:27.260]   at which point in time you can apply.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.620]   But if we look at the best wrestlers,
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:30.460]   and then when I say best,
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.780]   I don't necessarily mean most successful,
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.140]   although of course, most successful
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.380]   are always very, very good.
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.660]   Throughout the course of history in boxing,
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.900]   in wrestling, in Judo, they're magical.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.660]   They disappear and reappear.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.700]   It's like fighting a ghost that is like incorporeal
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.620]   when you wanna find it,
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.660]   but then when you don't wanna find it,
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.700]   it finds you.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.580]   And I think that we see that
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.420]   in the like the Buwaisa Saityus of wrestling.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:00.620]   And I guess you could look at Floyd Mayweather
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:05.140]   or Willie Pepp or Pernell Whitaker in boxing
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.540]   as brilliant examples of disappearing and reappearing.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.660]   And when you're strong, it's almost like guerrilla warfare.
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.740]   When you're strong, I'm nowhere to be found.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.820]   When you're weak, you can't get rid of me.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.060]   And I think that's what we're looking for.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.020]   - Yeah, the Satya brothers are incredible at that.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:24.060]   They look like skinny Starbucks baristas,
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:29.060]   and they just manhandle everybody effortlessly.
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.860]   They look like they just kind of woke up,
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.820]   rolled out of bed,
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.860]   fighting for the gold medal at the Olympics,
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.120]   and just effortlessly throw.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.060]   Like there's a match against, I guess, Yul Romero.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:47.420]   Yeah, so like if you look at like who is the guy
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.260]   who's intimidating in this case,
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.540]   and terrifying looking, it's Yul Romero,
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.060]   just like a physical specimen,
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.260]   obviously like a super accomplished wrestler.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.340]   I think this is for the gold medal, yeah, in 2000.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.100]   - 2000. - Yeah, Sydney.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.140]   And then there-
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.060]   - This is the year you all took silver.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.860]   - And what you, just to show you,
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:15.140]   like there's a inside trip, effortless.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.160]   Oh gee, he does it again.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:23.220]   You know, it's a really creative kind of wrestling where-
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.060]   - It's organic.
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.340]   - Yeah, you're throwing all these kinds of things.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.620]   There's just a mix of judo,
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:31.380]   a mix of like weird kind of moves.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.620]   It's not like as funky as Ben Askren.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:39.020]   It's just like legitimate, basic.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.700]   - Well, it's not funky for funky's sake.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.660]   And I'm not poking Ben Askren to imply
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.020]   that that's what he's doing, but it's like, it's funny.
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.220]   It's like a lot of times, it's almost like Musashi
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.460]   talked a lot about that.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.180]   You know, that the only goal of combat is to win,
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.480]   is the outcome, it's outcome driven,
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.660]   versus like flourishing, you know, cool looking movements.
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.820]   It's like, unless that had a utilitarian purpose,
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:00.780]   like what are you wasting your time with that,
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:03.780]   both in the fight and also, you know, in practice.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.980]   But as you mentioned, it's almost like it looks like judo.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:06.820]   It looks like wrestling.
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:07.640]   It looks like jujitsu.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.980]   It's almost like, I guess,
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.740]   reminds me all of the martial arts
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.660]   is again, deeply tribal as well.
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.700]   I wanna learn Lex Fridman martial arts.
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.900]   And then I wanna learn another, you know,
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.820]   I guess transcendent person's martial arts.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.640]   And it just happened to be the set of movements
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.620]   that you tended to do most of the time,
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.060]   thanks to your body type and your opposition and whatnot.
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.380]   But then I try to codify that and force those to work
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.640]   as opposed to going, I wanna understand
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.620]   how the body works in concert
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:33.660]   and in Congress with something else.
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.140]   And other forces and move appropriately.
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.740]   And that's why it's like, it always struck me
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.580]   that the Scythian brothers are great examples
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.340]   of just moving like water,
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.820]   but they use Bruce Lee, which is a little trite,
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:44.660]   but again, he's brilliant.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.060]   It's like water can flow or water can crash.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.540]   And they would crash when they needed to crash.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.760]   And they would flow when they needed to flow,
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.820]   but they would flow for the purpose of dissipating
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.580]   and then crash when they would win.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:54.580]   And at the right moment,
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:55.940]   then go back to flowing the second
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.120]   that the other person found them.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.780]   And it's just, it's beautiful to watch.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.860]   It's artistic.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.260]   And I think that that great expression
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:04.260]   of anything physical is ultimately studied as a science,
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.280]   but expressed as an art.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.700]   And I think that that's something that gets lost
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.940]   in jujitsu a lot of times when it gets a little bit,
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.860]   a little nerdy, like do this hand here, hand here.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.300]   Like the more details I have, the better.
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.100]   When in reality, that's just not in my experience,
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:16.940]   how it's done.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.260]   - Might be fun exercise of saying like,
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:25.700]   what are the main positions and submissions
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.580]   in the art of jujitsu?
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:28.900]   - You don't have to be complete.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.180]   That's a ridiculously, I apologize
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.340]   for putting you on the spot like this,
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.020]   but it might be a nice exercise to think through it.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:35.860]   - Sure.
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.340]   I mean, I would just say that there,
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.460]   you have your arms bend in various ways.
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.820]   You have key lock Americana, straight arm locks,
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:42.900]   Kimura Omoplata.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.780]   Omoplata is a Kimura, Kimura is an Omoplata.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:45.900]   It's just executed-- - Submissions.
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:46.740]   - It's just a submission.
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.580]   - Breaking off your arm in all kinds of ways.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.420]   - But ultimately, the question is,
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.540]   let's say you were a Terminator, like a robot,
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.580]   which of course you are.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:55.420]   - Go on. - Go on.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.260]   (laughing)
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:58.940]   It's like, all right, we're being completely literal.
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.060]   But, and I couldn't harm you with any of these things.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.580]   Would I still use these positions?
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:04.420]   The answer is yes.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.620]   They create leverage, they create control,
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.540]   they create shapes that I can affect
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.620]   and that can affect me,
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:11.660]   and they can be affected through other forces
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.220]   and other objects or structures like the ground or the wall.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.420]   I really enjoy mixed martial arts
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.380]   because there's another component
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.980]   rather than just me and you and the floor,
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.580]   there's me, you, the floor and the wall.
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.940]   And it's another player in the game
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.540]   that doesn't exist in a grappling context
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:28.580]   within a non-enclosed, I guess, area of combat.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:32.140]   But you can strangle me or choke me,
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.940]   what do you call it, without my arms being involved,
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.800]   or you can use one of my shoulders
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.220]   to pin one side of my, one carotid artery off
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.620]   and you can enclose the other.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.980]   You can turn my knee in the exact same ways
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.440]   that you can turn my arm, straight, this way and that way.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.820]   You can add a rotation to that
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.140]   or it can be directly linear against the joint.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.500]   So I guess what I would say is
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.180]   the more that I've been able to understand Jiu-Jitsu,
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.740]   the more that I've been,
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:00.220]   it's given me a look into how we learn language
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.220]   where rather than learning five bazillion adjectives,
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.220]   I go, I understand what an adjective is.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.220]   And of course, we are all read
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:09.060]   into some degree of vocabulary.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.180]   I understand what an adverb does
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.940]   and I understand what an adverb is.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:13.880]   I know what a noun is.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.020]   I know what the component parts of a sentence are.
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.780]   I know what, I guess, a clause, a contraction,
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:19.700]   any of these things.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:23.180]   And it allows you to be interesting and artistic
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.300]   with your language to the extent that you can.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.500]   But I can't, like I can speak a degree of Spanish,
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.740]   but I'm not even slightly artistic in Spanish.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.340]   I would be something,
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.740]   I speak like a child with a head injury.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.900]   And anyway, the-
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.180]   But your basic understanding of the English language
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.420]   allows you to then be a student of Spanish.
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.100]   100%, but I'm limited by my experience.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.580]   I'm limited by my understanding of techniques.
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.180]   I'm limited by my understanding,
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:51.020]   almost like let's say techniques are like vocabulary.
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:54.180]   So even if I kind of sort of grasp the sentence structure
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.620]   and the thought process and the thought patterns
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.380]   of Spanish, which it's interesting
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.500]   because just even the orientation
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:01.740]   and the organization of a language,
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.900]   and I've thought about this a great deal,
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.300]   the way that I perceive the world
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.860]   is affected deeply by the language that I learned.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:09.540]   Again, if I learned,
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.700]   I have no idea how the Chinese language structures,
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.220]   but I can only imagine that it would affect,
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.100]   it's like a different lens.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:16.340]   We're all looking at the same thing,
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:19.500]   but I have a different set of sunglasses on than you do.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.940]   And that's very, very interesting.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.620]   I'll use the Quran as an example.
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.900]   Apparently it's unbelievably poetic in Arabic.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.540]   Still neat and was interesting reading in English,
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.060]   but I'm told by people that I trust
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.180]   that it just one doesn't bear a resemblance to the other.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.780]   And I think that's a very interesting thing
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.940]   that you may be able to say the same thing,
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.100]   but in a more, I guess in a different way,
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.900]   in a more artistic way that may not translate
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.780]   on a one-for-one kind of fidelity.
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:49.020]   But the more that we're able to understand
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:50.300]   about how the body works,
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.220]   the more examples of the body working this way,
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.060]   the body working that way,
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:54.300]   the body working that way,
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:56.340]   the more that I'm able to eventually become an artist,
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.980]   but it has to be studied as a science first.
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:59.700]   And it does start with technique collection,
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.420]   vocabulary collection, the same way we learn in school,
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:06.820]   where you remember how to say quickly 17 different ways.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.460]   And let's say I speak Spanish, I only know three.
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:12.460]   So you might use quickly,
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.180]   you might use an adjective like quickly in Spanish,
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.820]   but use one of the many, many options to describe that,
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:17.660]   that I don't understand.
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.060]   And now I sit there and go like, wait, what?
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.260]   I can't be artistic.
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:23.380]   I can't be as organic with the language as I'd like.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:24.860]   So I believe that jujitsu a lot of times
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.180]   starts with the acquisition of a lot of,
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.580]   hey, do this, this drill, this technique.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.500]   Here's an Americana, Americana to an arm lock,
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.380]   arm lock to a triangle.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.740]   But the problem with that is oftentimes
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.700]   we get stuck in that phase.
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.740]   And people eventually become move collectors
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.740]   or sequence collectors.
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.660]   And I noticed this when I'm trying to do DVDs
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:45.660]   or I guess like an instructional series now,
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.180]   or even teaching in class.
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.660]   I don't believe in that form of learning anymore.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.900]   Not that it's not valuable,
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.260]   but I don't believe,
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.980]   I don't understand jujitsu on that level anymore.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:55.500]   So what I'm trying to do is get across
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.060]   the basic ideas to people and say,
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:59.220]   hey, you need to fill in the gaps
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.180]   with going to class all the time.
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:02.500]   You need to go, hey, learn this move,
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.860]   learn that technique, learn that technique,
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.980]   because otherwise I'm basically just throwing at you
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:08.500]   like 75 different words that you could use,
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:12.060]   but that hasn't really taught you how to speak a language.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:14.020]   Whereas if you give me a language structure,
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.140]   you can fill in these pieces on your own
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:19.020]   and then eventually speak organically in Lex form,
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:20.820]   which will be ultimately unique to you
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.580]   because otherwise you just end up being
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.700]   like a weird facsimile of whatever it is that I'm doing
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.300]   for mostly the worst, I'd say.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:29.140]   But-
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:30.900]   - Yeah, that's what people, I mean, people comment,
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:32.380]   like, is this, especially people
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:34.620]   who haven't listened to me before,
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.140]   is this guy drunk or high?
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:42.140]   Does he, does MIT really allow slow people to be-
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:44.420]   - Quotas.
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:45.540]   - Quotas, yeah.
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.020]   Like what's wrong with him?
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.060]   Is he getting sleep?
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:48.900]   Are you okay?
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:50.420]   And does he need help?
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.260]   So that's similar with my jujitsu.
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:54.900]   It's like, is this guy really,
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:57.180]   whatever rank I was throughout,
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:01.020]   I remember just like, is this guy really this rank?
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.500]   I just have a very kind of certain way of sitting
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.340]   and being slow and lazy looking
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.420]   that was ultimately the language that I had to discover.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:14.300]   And it was, yeah, it was a very liberating moment, I think,
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:19.500]   of probably a few years of getting my ass kicked,
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.420]   especially with "Open Guard" and "Butterfly"
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.860]   to where you really allow yourself
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:24.940]   to take in the entirety of the language
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:29.940]   and realize that I'm not, I'm a unique,
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.180]   I'm unique and like, I have a very,
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.660]   I have a language, I have a set of techniques,
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.620]   a way I move my body that needs,
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.300]   that I'm the one to discover.
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.380]   Like it's, you can only,
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.220]   you can learn specific techniques and so on,
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.660]   but you really have to understand your own body.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.460]   And that's the beautiful thing about Jiu-Jitsu,
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:54.460]   like you said, is like the connection about your philosophy,
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:57.140]   your view of the world with the physical
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.260]   and like connecting those two things,
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.940]   how you perceive the world,
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.780]   how you interpret ideas of the world about exhaustion,
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:07.540]   about force, about effortlessness,
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.100]   like what it really means to relax,
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.060]   all these kinds of loose concepts,
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:16.060]   and then actually teach your body to like do those things.
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:20.060]   And like, you know, and be able to apply force in spurts,
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:21.300]   be able to relax in spurts
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:26.100]   and like figure all that stuff out for my individual body.
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:27.100]   - But it's, as you mentioned,
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.140]   that's, I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:31.260]   It's a discovery process and no one can cheat that process,
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:32.460]   which is at the same time,
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:34.260]   it's almost like imagine I want to start writing books
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.860]   in second grade, unless maybe I'm like staggeringly brilliant,
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.220]   like which I can only conceptualize
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:40.300]   someone being able to do that,
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.380]   but maybe a Mozart of the English language
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.780]   where you're out there doing it.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:45.980]   But for most of us, we don't have enough knowledge,
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:47.500]   enough information, enough experience
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:51.100]   to be able to express ourselves.
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:56.100]   So we have to basically input, repeat, which is important,
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.100]   but it's the process, as you say,
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.660]   of going through that, of getting your ass kicked,
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:00.820]   to just like, well, that didn't work,
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.060]   well, that didn't work, that felt right,
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.180]   but I don't know, nobody else does that.
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:04.480]   I guess I don't believe in that,
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.580]   versus eventually going, I don't know,
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.580]   I'll just try going my own way and see what happens.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:10.380]   And now I'll get yelled at and people won't like me.
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.780]   And if it works, they'll say I got lucky.
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.700]   And if it doesn't work, they'll say I was dumb,
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.420]   but which maybe all is right.
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:19.300]   But basically, going through that iterative process
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.860]   that allows you to eventually find your self-expression
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.980]   and find your voice so that you fight
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:25.940]   the same way that you speak, the same way that you write,
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.620]   the same way that you think in a way that is uniquely you,
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.780]   that will also ultimately allow you
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.740]   to understand other people being uniquely them.
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.620]   Because even if you can only conceptualize,
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:37.660]   and I think about this a lot for society stuff,
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.660]   where I go, well, this is how I feel about this,
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.500]   but am I objectively right?
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.660]   Maybe about a couple of things, but that's a small box
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:44.820]   that I have to be very, very careful
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:47.300]   about what I think is objective versus what's not.
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.740]   And I have to be open to the possibility
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.900]   that all the things that I think are objectively correct
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.060]   may or may not be.
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.660]   And that should allow me to have some degree
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:57.020]   of compassion or consideration for other people,
[00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.100]   both in their martial arts journey and in their journey
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.820]   as people, as human beings,
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:06.620]   because I understand that we're all on a path,
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.780]   it's all, again, an iterative process
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.580]   of eventual self-expression.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.620]   But I think that's one of the things
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:15.140]   that we see having trouble when we see tribalism,
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.380]   which, I mean, racism is expression of that,
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.180]   political affiliation, expression of that,
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.460]   all of these things that can go
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.940]   in really uncomfortable directions.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.340]   People are looking for,
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.700]   hey, where do I plant my feet over here?
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.820]   Where's the thing that I know is right?
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.060]   And we can all agree on the following.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.140]   And I think that we see that in martial arts.
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.300]   We're like, oh, I do this style.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.140]   Well, I do that style.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.980]   I do that style.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.780]   It's like, hey, man, we're all just pushing forward
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.420]   in a certain direction here, trying to do our best.
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:38.700]   And I understand why you feel the way you do.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.620]   I may have felt like that at one point too,
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:44.260]   but I'm just trying to learn and understand
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:47.100]   versus I've already acquired enough knowledge.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.180]   Let me cross my arms and start to look
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.700]   who's fucking up around here.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:55.060]   And I think that it's an interesting trap
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.100]   that I think is a very human trap to fall into,
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.660]   but it definitely happens early on.
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.340]   It's, I mean, it's a joke in the jiu-jitsu world, right?
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.180]   Like, oh, the blue belt that knows everything.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.220]   Well, initially it's like, what?
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.380]   I know nothing, and I at least think I know nothing.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.660]   Then I'd learn a little bit, and I think it's a lot bit.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.580]   And then the more you learn, the more you go like,
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:10.580]   I don't even know what I'm doing.
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.420]   (laughs)
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.020]   - Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:14.940]   We kind of talked about it a little bit,
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:18.140]   but once again, a lot of people that listen to this
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.860]   have never been on the mat, have never tried jiu-jitsu,
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:23.100]   but are really curious about it.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.460]   Everybody at all positions, like I think Elon Musk's kids
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.660]   are now doing jiu-jitsu.
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.420]   Andrew Yang is, like they're all, you know,
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.620]   the world is curious.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:36.020]   It's a nice, it seems to be a nice methodology
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.060]   by which to humble your ego,
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.980]   which to grow intellectually and physically.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.140]   So people are curious about it.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.900]   So the natural question is, if they're curious about it,
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.180]   how would you recommend they get started?
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:51.740]   Maybe like, what do you recommend the first day, week,
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.540]   month, year, first couple of years look like?
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.140]   Like, how do you ease into it and make sure
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.980]   that it's a positive experience,
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:03.420]   and you progress in the most optimal and positive way?
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:07.020]   - The first thing you can do is simply ask yourself why,
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.220]   why you wanna be involved.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.980]   I remember the first day that I walked into Ronin Athletics
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.140]   in New York City to train under my godfather,
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.460]   my son now, Christian Montes.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.260]   And I didn't know what I was getting myself into.
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.180]   I played baseball through high school,
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.660]   and I was at Manhattan College in the Bronx,
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.380]   and I wanted to go and learn martial arts
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.580]   because it was always something that was interesting to me,
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:33.140]   but it was never something that I knew was accessible,
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.900]   and it definitely wasn't really around in Northern Virginia
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.140]   where I grew up, whereas then you stick yourself
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.100]   in Manhattan and there's stuff everywhere.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.300]   So anyway, I guess I didn't know what to expect.
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.220]   I didn't know if I was gonna get beat up,
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.220]   if people were gonna be nice,
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.340]   if people were not gonna be nice.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:52.980]   But what I began with was, I think, expectation management.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.900]   And I think that that's something that I would,
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.540]   that'd be the first thing that I would start
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.620]   is almost imagining what is it that I'm getting myself into?
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.900]   Because I love the martial arts.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.460]   Martial arts has given me everything in life,
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.780]   and I'm so thankful I wouldn't be sitting here
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.220]   without that experience, that journey.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.940]   The people that I've met, the places that I've gone,
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:15.340]   I could never, ever have ever imagined.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:19.060]   And I'm just unbelievably thankful for that.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:24.060]   But I think that the thing that helped me most of all
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.580]   was starting with going,
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.300]   my mom said something to me one time,
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.700]   and she said, "There's two types of people
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.660]   "in various situations.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.460]   "There's why and there's why not."
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.660]   And it's understandable to have questions,
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.700]   concerns, things like that.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.460]   But maybe sometimes it's a little bit easier
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.980]   when you're younger to just trust people
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.180]   or just say, "I don't know."
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.660]   But we go, "Hey, you wanna climb that rock?"
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.500]   I'm like, "Yeah, why not?
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.340]   "Let's go."
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.180]   "Hey, you wanna jump in that river?"
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.020]   "Yeah, why not?"
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:50.840]   "Sure."
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.220]   Versus if I have to reason my way into everything,
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.100]   if I have to be taught into everything,
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.780]   a lot of times I'll talk myself out of it.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.820]   And I think that a lot of times
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:59.760]   this is the thinker's disease.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.500]   You wanna figure out what's gonna happen
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.700]   and what you should expect to have happen
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.460]   before you get involved
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.660]   versus going using the old Bruce Lee's
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.340]   saying, again, it's like no amount of thinking
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:10.980]   or training on the side of the river
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.340]   will teach you how to swim.
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.660]   You have to jump in.
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.420]   And there are risks associated with that.
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.540]   And so, I guess, psychological
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:19.660]   are usually the biggest ones.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.740]   That's the biggest hurdle.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.640]   And physical.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.500]   But the biggest thing that I guess
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.640]   I would suggest to anyone to say,
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.580]   "Why do you wanna do this?"
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.120]   You're like, "Well, I wanna challenge myself.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.360]   "I wanna learn.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.240]   "I would like to learn to fight.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.080]   "I want to learn to fight
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.400]   "so that I could protect myself
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.880]   "and if anything else, other people,
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.460]   "if only within arm's reach."
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:40.020]   I perceived that if I had some small degree of power,
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.460]   I generally wouldn't use it,
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.780]   which is why I was like, "Yeah, I'll give it a try.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.760]   "I'll try to be reasonable.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.100]   "And hopefully, if I make a mistake,
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.180]   "I'll apologize to people."
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:49.040]   But basically, I said, "Yeah, I'd like to have that.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:52.100]   "And I know this is gonna be challenging
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:54.100]   "and we'll see what happens."
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.620]   And that means that getting beat up,
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.740]   and I didn't get hurt,
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:57.780]   but getting roughed up,
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.860]   getting my arm bent this way or that way,
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:00.700]   getting choked, I was like,
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:01.760]   "Well, this is all supposed to happen.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.920]   "That's no big deal."
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.740]   It would be like going and joining the army
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.100]   during peace time,
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.540]   and then going, "Oh, I'm just doing this
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.580]   "for a college education."
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.820]   You're like, "Okay, that's cool, man."
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.540]   And then all of a sudden, war breaks out
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.500]   and they wanna send me somewhere.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.480]   And I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.020]   "I didn't sign up for that."
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:17.380]   Actually, you did, whether you realize it or not.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.820]   You may not have thought that you did, but you did.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.740]   So getting your mind right
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.500]   and just going, "What are my expectations of this activity?
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.940]   "What is it that I'm looking to do?"
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:28.680]   And of course, you're going into a gym,
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.460]   you're going into a place that you don't know people,
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.660]   or you probably don't know people,
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.580]   and you don't know the coach.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.020]   And even if you do wanna, "Hey, how you doing?
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.940]   "Shake your hand," type of level.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.860]   95% of my students don't know me, not really.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.580]   I try to be polite and not annoy them too much,
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:43.100]   but they don't know me and I don't know them.
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.260]   I understand if they don't trust me.
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:48.140]   I wouldn't trust, trust me either if I were them.
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:50.820]   But at the same time, someone has to take that leap.
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.680]   And one of the things that I've noticed
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.840]   as a martial arts instructor that's the biggest struggle
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.940]   with dealing with adults,
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.660]   which is why a lot of people like to teach kids,
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:01.020]   is 'cause kids don't argue.
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.080]   Now, that also means there's all sorts of pitfalls
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.880]   with that sort of thing, and that can be an issue.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.300]   But I guess a lot of times people get to a point
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:10.700]   in their life, in their 20s, early 30s,
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.340]   where now I'm a manager now, I know what I'm doing.
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.860]   No one talks to me like that.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.380]   First, it's like, "Hey, man, you go join bootcamp.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.580]   "I don't care if you are Elon Musk.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.300]   "They're gonna tell you to shut up and do pushups."
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.300]   And that's what's great about it.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.880]   So you are taking a leap of faith into a world
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.460]   that you're gonna be a tiny fish.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.900]   And you gotta hope that the people
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.620]   who are guiding you in that journey are gonna have,
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:34.500]   I can't even say your best interest at heart
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:35.460]   because they don't even know you,
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:36.860]   but they'll try to do no harm.
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:37.680]   And they'll try to help you
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.140]   in the way that they would understand.
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.540]   And I guess that's, for instance,
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.620]   that's what I would try to do with anyone
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.340]   that comes into my gym.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.700]   I would try to help them in the way
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.660]   that I understand they need as best I can,
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:51.400]   and as safe and reasonable a way as possible.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.240]   But sometimes in a way
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.220]   that's gonna make them uncomfortable,
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.180]   particularly if physical combat,
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:58.260]   and it's not something they've done before.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.700]   If they've, a lot of people go in
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.420]   without even having played contact sports.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.700]   And so that can be a big jump.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.780]   And you have to understand
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.260]   if that's where you're starting from, no worries.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.300]   But you're gonna have to kind of work your way to it,
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.260]   and it's gonna be uncomfortable, and that's okay.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.220]   It's part of the process.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.860]   And you're gonna have some bumps and bruises,
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.700]   and you're not gonna wanna roll with that guy in the corner
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.700]   'cause that person's rough and they beat you up.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.580]   And they're like, "Okay, but is this a big hurt
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.840]   or is it a little hurt?"
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.340]   If it's a big hurt, okay.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.420]   If it's a little hurt,
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:27.300]   it needs you to center up a little bit.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.420]   - It's such an interesting balance because to find,
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.540]   I think one of the most important things,
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.700]   as in anything, I think, in life,
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:39.480]   is the selection of the people that you put around you.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.060]   I mean, that's true with getting married.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.660]   That's true with, if you go to,
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.660]   if people ask me, like graduate students,
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:51.660]   like your PhD advisor can be the difference.
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:52.860]   It's everything.
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:55.340]   It's like you spend five years with somebody,
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.900]   they're going to basically define,
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.620]   more impact on you than anybody you marry,
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.460]   anybody you hang out with, there's a huge impact.
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:05.300]   And the same with the coach selection,
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:08.980]   which is like the school selection,
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:11.700]   is it's going to be really important about,
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:14.100]   in terms of like who you select,
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:19.020]   will define how happy, like the trajectory of your growth
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.180]   and how happy you are with the entirety of the experience.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:26.180]   And yet, like the flip side of that is,
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.420]   especially if you have an ego,
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.940]   especially if you are the manager
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:31.340]   that needs to let go of some stuff,
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.420]   you're going to feel like shit
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.860]   with the best kind of coach.
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:37.580]   That's what you need.
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.500]   But there's a weird balance there to find.
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.540]   I mean, and everybody needs a different thing.
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:48.540]   Like I'm much more, I enjoy being sort of like,
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:51.460]   it sounds weird, but like I'm,
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.340]   from the wrestling background,
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:56.540]   I enjoy feeling like crap in the sense,
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:00.260]   like the coach, like getting beat up.
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.620]   I don't actually enjoy it.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.100]   It's not like some masochistic thing or whatever.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.460]   - I know exactly what you mean.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:06.580]   - It's the growth.
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.220]   Like I like the anxiety.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:12.860]   I like feeling like shit when I go home,
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:17.420]   like emotionally, physically, it's growth.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.460]   - It's a sign of growth, right?
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.260]   Like if you're not having to feel those things,
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.620]   you're probably in your comfort zone, which is fine,
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.860]   but that's not your growth zone, right?
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:28.460]   - And everybody has a different threshold for that.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:31.780]   I mean, the beautiful thing about Jiu Jitsu is like,
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:34.500]   it's also has like a yoga feel to it.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.460]   Like you're learning about your body.
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:38.700]   So depending on the gym and depending on,
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.660]   and in fact, the coaches, the people around you,
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.860]   within the gym, you can select little groups too,
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.860]   kind of like the people with who you roll.
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:48.420]   Like if you're a smaller person,
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:50.100]   it doesn't mean you have to go against big people.
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.300]   You can go against the people who like smoke a lot of weed
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.020]   and they're chill, or you can go against like that crazy,
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:57.540]   ripped blue belt competitor
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.420]   who's like out to destroy everybody.
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:02.380]   And depending on like what your mindset is,
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:03.860]   you can kind of select that.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.340]   It's such a fascinating journey
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:09.620]   of like basically self-discovery.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.700]   - I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.900]   It's been what you need may change over time, right?
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:16.140]   Maybe what you need today could change six months from now
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:16.980]   or a year from now.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.420]   Something that I experienced,
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.500]   I'll use my first coach, Christian again,
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.740]   as a great example of someone
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.860]   who I really look up to and respect
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.340]   and someone who helped me a lot.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.540]   Like at a time when I really needed some guidance
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:30.180]   and I needed to learn martial arts, but get into,
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.980]   Henzo Gracie's gym was right down the street
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.620]   from where Christian was teaching.
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.140]   And Christian was a blue belt at the time.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:37.020]   He was teaching at a place called Fight House,
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:41.940]   which was this awesome, like 90s, early 2000s,
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:46.940]   warehouse area down on Fashion Avenue in Manhattan.
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.340]   Off of like between 7th and 8th.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.940]   And it was like two basketball courts wide,
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:52.500]   but like there was the Sambo guys over here.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.660]   There was the Kali guys over there.
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.500]   There was a Wing Chun over there.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.660]   There was Jiu-Jitsu in the corner.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.100]   And Henzo's was one of the most famous academies
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.740]   in the world at that time, still is.
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.300]   And I just didn't know what Henzo Gracie was.
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.060]   And I mean, it's a great gym
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.180]   and it's a fantastic place for people to train.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.180]   But I think what was right for me at the time
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:12.620]   was I stumbled into like a two-person elevator up
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.540]   and found a place where six people trained at that time.
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:18.820]   And I had someone that could give me some,
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:20.460]   like in addition to martial arts advice,
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.020]   like personal guidance.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.620]   And that made a big difference.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:26.340]   And then when initially we would have like competitions
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.140]   or like intra-gym competitions with the Sambo guys,
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:31.820]   we would roll with them.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.100]   And like, again, it was great
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:34.980]   'cause they were just a bunch of like Russian dudes
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.940]   from like Brighton Beach and they would come down
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.300]   and then we would all fight and then everyone would train
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.060]   and we'd all drink tea and then go home.
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:43.340]   And anyway, what was-
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.460]   - Oh, Russians.
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:45.980]   - It was super tough.
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.820]   And they were like, again, just a tough group of people.
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:48.660]   It was great.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.380]   And then I remember when I decided
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:52.420]   after like four or five months,
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:54.140]   I'm like, man, I really wanna try to take this seriously.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.100]   And I told Christian about that.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:55.940]   And he's like, well, hey,
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:56.820]   I think you need to do the following.
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:59.940]   And it was like, hey, there was a guy named Jeff Ruth
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.460]   who was a Purple Belt at the time,
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.020]   which was a much bigger deal than it is now,
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.700]   but it was 10 and O, he was an MMA fighter,
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.740]   a lot of amateur box experience, super tough dude.
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:09.420]   And Jeff was the best person at that time
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.260]   that I'd ever trained with.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.300]   And I just got squashed.
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.180]   Christian used to beat me up too,
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:14.180]   but like Jeff would just absolutely
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.100]   kick the crap out of me.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.620]   And I was like, this is awesome.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:18.180]   And this was back when I was at home.
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.340]   I went home for the summer for that.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.180]   And Chris was like, hey, I think you should stay.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:22.660]   Because I told him that's what I was thinking.
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.820]   And this was a coach that,
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:27.620]   when initially was exactly what I needed.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.460]   And then he's like, well, hey,
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.500]   that's not what I'm doing here.
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.100]   Maybe they're gonna be able to help you onto a path
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.260]   that's kind of commensurate
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:34.820]   with what your goals are at the moment.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:37.540]   And then that was an interesting thing.
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:40.500]   And I really got, I feel that I was fortunate to start
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:43.820]   at a place where my coach was able to transition roles
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:46.260]   and do so comfortably.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.300]   And I think that that also was probably a factor
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.480]   of the fact that, where he'd done some of his training prior,
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.020]   like there'd been issues with the coach there.
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:56.460]   We're like not supporting, not having the support,
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.660]   feeling like, hey, I'm gonna hold onto my students.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.220]   I'm gonna hold onto my best guy or my best girl,
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.500]   even if I can't take them where they need to go.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.380]   So that was an interesting thing.
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.140]   And just recognizing also though, that the people,
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.860]   like the same way you're an individual
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.260]   going into a gym and you don't know
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:13.460]   what you're getting into, your coach is a person too.
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.820]   And he or she, they may have been doing this activity
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.620]   longer than you, but they're not some weird little,
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.220]   all knowing God, they don't know anything.
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.840]   They may say something that pisses you off.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.860]   They may yell at you.
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:26.700]   They may help you.
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:31.060]   They may inadvertently cause you some sort of issue.
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.740]   And just being able to recognize that even though,
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.300]   I say this to people and I've said this to people
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.820]   in my gym, I'm like, we're in the service industry, man,
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.940]   but I'm not at your service.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:39.980]   Like don't get it twisted.
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:42.640]   Like I will absolutely do my best to help people.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.580]   I'm there to do my best as a martial arts coach,
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.380]   but I'm here to do my best as a martial arts coach.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.220]   And I'll do my best and periodically I make mistakes
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:51.300]   and I owe an apology or two,
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.060]   and I'll try to give them out when I can.
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.320]   But we're not McDonald's.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.540]   It's not, oh, you gave me a hundred bucks,
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:56.700]   so you do whatever you want in here.
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:57.540]   This is my house.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:58.360]   This is my gym.
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.200]   This is my dojo.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.020]   This is a martial arts.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.220]   This is not a basketball team.
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.780]   - Yeah, there's something beautiful about martial arts.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.700]   Like exactly as you said, is the coach,
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.740]   like in wrestling and at least collegiate,
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.380]   like high level wrestling,
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:14.820]   it's like there's a dictatorship aspect to a coach
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.260]   that is very important to have.
[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:21.260]   Like this ridiculous sometimes nature of like master
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:23.340]   and so on and bowing, all these traditions.
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.640]   There's something, it seems ridiculous
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.900]   from the outside perhaps,
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.020]   but there's something really powerful to that.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.300]   Because that process of, you said, why not,
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.360]   of letting go of the leap of faith
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.380]   requires you to believe that the coach
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.020]   has your best interest in mind
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:42.460]   and just give yourself over to their ideas
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:44.740]   of how you should grow.
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:45.980]   And that's an interesting thing.
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:50.460]   I mean, I've never been able to really see coaches
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.580]   I've had as human.
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:56.180]   You always, it's like a father figure,
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:59.500]   but like you always put them in this position of power.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:03.340]   And I think that's, I think at least for me,
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.900]   it's been a very useful way to see the coach
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:10.260]   because it allows you to not think and let go
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.340]   and really allow yourself to grow
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.860]   and emotionally deal with all the beatings.
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:16.660]   - They'll push you where past oftentimes
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.380]   where you would have stopped yourself, right?
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.220]   Which is great.
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:21.980]   And then hopefully they know if they're paying attention
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:24.020]   and they're still a person, they can make mistakes,
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.980]   but they'll push you further than you would have gone,
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:28.620]   but not so far that it's not facilitative, right?
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.240]   That's something that I can say like Faraz Zahabi,
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.420]   the head coach at TriStar, my head coach for MMA,
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.420]   Kenny Florin, one of the head coaches for MMA,
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.260]   have both been phenomenal influences.
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:39.300]   Paul Schreiner, who's one of the assistants
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.340]   at Marcelo Garcia's Academy,
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.780]   coached me in Jiu-Jitsu for a long time,
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:45.420]   brilliant instructor, they've all been able to do that.
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.620]   And I think what's interesting about all of those guys,
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.220]   they're very sharp, but they're very intuitive as well.
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:53.500]   And I think that Faraz actually told me about some
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:54.660]   of the John Wooden said,
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.660]   John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach,
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.540]   just a simple philosophical idea.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:03.220]   Just he said, "Some people's life is a bowl of shit.
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:04.740]   It needs some whipped cream in it.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:06.900]   Some people's life is a bowl of whipped cream.
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.860]   Needs a little bit of shit in it just to balance it out."
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:09.940]   And it's an interesting thing,
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:13.060]   coaching everyone the same way doesn't work.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:13.900]   That's I think the difference
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:14.980]   between a coach and an instructor.
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.780]   And a lot of times people think they want to coach,
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.860]   but they really want an instructor.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:20.620]   I'm like, "Hey Lex, tell me what to do, not how to do it."
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:23.800]   And then other times people think they want an instructor
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.220]   and they really want a coach.
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:27.220]   And I'm like, "Man, this guy's just giving me information."
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.940]   A coach is so much more than an instructor.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.140]   And that's a huge leap.
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:31.900]   And that's something that I think that people need
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.580]   to understand when they're going into martial arts.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.340]   And I can totally grasp why they don't,
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:36.920]   because how would they know?
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.820]   But I think about this a lot.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:41.220]   Like me giving you $150 for a month,
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.260]   which is not nothing, that's for sure.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:45.820]   That does not, that pays for instructor really.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.420]   Coach is a relationship that gets developed.
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:48.260]   Because can you imagine,
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:50.300]   like just the amount of emotional investment
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.420]   and time thinking away from like,
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.180]   "Oh, Lex isn't here anymore, but what can I do to help him?
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.220]   What does he need?"
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.340]   Like that's serious.
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.060]   And that's the difference between,
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.900]   that's oftentimes the difference
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:03.780]   that getting over the hump in various situations.
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.100]   So it's an interesting bargain that's being made,
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.620]   like commitment by the instructor who becomes a coach,
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.060]   commitment by the student.
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.860]   You know, like there's a financial transaction.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.020]   There's a lot of things going on there,
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.480]   but I feel very fortunate to have had
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.580]   not just instructors in my time, but coaches.
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:20.300]   And that means sometimes we butted heads
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.460]   and sometimes I look back and I think I was right.
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:23.660]   And other times I look back on my own,
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:24.860]   no, they were definitely right.
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:26.780]   But there was always the trust
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.300]   with the exception of one time
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:31.060]   that I feel that trust was greatly betrayed,
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:34.020]   that rightly or wrongly, whether mistakes,
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:34.940]   mistakes will be made,
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:38.580]   but everyone is attempting to do the right thing.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:39.580]   Under no circumstances
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:42.180]   would I intentionally do anything malicious,
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:44.660]   you know, versus, "Hey, I might've burnt your house down,
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.620]   but you can be darn sure it wasn't on purpose."
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.260]   And I think that as long as there's that mutual understanding
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:51.140]   and mutual belief of goodwill,
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:53.180]   which again, doesn't just magic up out of nowhere,
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.300]   I understand.
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.420]   I think that that's when then great things can happen.
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.660]   And I look at all the athletes that I know,
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:17:59.860]   the guys and girls that I've watched
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:03.460]   become fantastic in various places, almost invariably,
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:05.260]   it never happened alone.
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.460]   - Yeah, I'm really torn about that.
[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.700]   Like maybe you can help.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.500]   Have you seen the movie "Whiplash"?
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.340]   - Mm-mm.
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:16.740]   - So it's, I would say from an outsider's perspective,
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:17.580]   people should watch it.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:20.340]   It's a, I guess, jazz band,
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:23.940]   it's a movie about a drummer and the instructor.
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:27.020]   And he is a basically, I would say,
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:30.260]   from the outsider's perspective, it's a toxic relationship,
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.980]   but he's really the coach, whatever we call him,
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:38.380]   pushes the musician, the drummer to his limits,
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:43.380]   like to where he just feels like shit emotionally.
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:45.900]   It looks like a toxic relationship,
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:49.060]   but it's one that ultimately is very productive
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:52.660]   for the improvement of the musician.
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.900]   - I have the same, like in my own experience,
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:59.900]   I had, I got a chance to train at a couple places regularly.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:05.540]   And so one of my coaches, who is a great human being,
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:08.620]   a lot of people love him, but when I was a blue belt,
[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:11.780]   he was pushing me a lot for competition.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.900]   And every time I step on the mat,
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:18.900]   I was anxious and almost afraid of training
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:23.620]   because of the places I'm gonna have to go.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:28.620]   And then the, I can't, I don't know what's good or bad
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:32.280]   because I think I've become a better person
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.940]   because of that experience.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:35.540]   Like I needed that.
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.020]   And on the flip side,
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:40.100]   like the place I got my black belt from,
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:43.820]   Balance Studios, I remember also a blue belt,
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.280]   the coach sitting down and I was going to competition
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.660]   and he saw something in me where he said,
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:58.300]   good luck, but win or lose, we always love you.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:03.860]   I remember that because I really needed that at that time.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:06.180]   Like I was putting so much pressure on myself.
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:10.400]   Like I'm not an actual professional competitor.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.920]   I just competed, like I'm a PhD student,
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.860]   but it was clearly having a psychological effect on me.
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.100]   And that's what a great coach does.
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:22.540]   It's like, you know, it's like life is more important
[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:23.380]   than jiu-jitsu.
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:24.500]   - That's for sure. - It's bigger.
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:28.160]   So they find, you use jiu-jitsu when you need it
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.900]   to grow as a person.
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:32.580]   And when it overwhelms you,
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:34.500]   you have to pull that person out.
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:35.680]   Like look at the bigger picture.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.300]   Always look at the bigger picture.
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.140]   It's fascinating.
[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:39.900]   And I don't know what to make of it.
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.780]   I don't think I would have it any other way,
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:45.620]   is both the anxiety and the love.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.460]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:48.660]   I think that's a really interesting thing
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:51.900]   that you're describing that I guess it kind of brings me
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:53.660]   back to a lot of the other things we've been discussing
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:57.220]   is just almost like the reciprocal nature of everything
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:00.440]   where no pressure, that's great.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.940]   Everyone's happy all the time.
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.780]   I mean, let's use an example of sci-fi movies,
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:05.600]   let's say "The Matrix,"
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.980]   which of course the first one was amazing.
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:09.340]   And then each subsequent movie made the series worse.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.940]   But basically--
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.100]   - They're working on a new one, by the way.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:12.940]   - Yeah, I've heard.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:13.760]   We'll see.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.600]   I was hoping for the best.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.440]   But basically, let's say, hey, we started,
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.760]   our first initial world, Agent Smith says to Neo,
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.560]   he's like, "Our first world was a utopia
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.800]   "where everyone was happy and nothing ever went wrong."
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.480]   It's like your primitive cerebrum rejected it.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.760]   And I think that there's obviously,
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.920]   I mean, what do I think?
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:31.960]   But I guess, well, I'm here,
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.720]   so I might as well say what I think.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:38.720]   I guess great things are fantastic.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:42.360]   A kind, gentle place is fantastic.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.800]   And this is, again, why I love "Dune"
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.400]   because I think "Dune" does such a great job of expressing,
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.680]   Frank Herbert does such a great job of expressing, again,
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.680]   the reciprocal nature of these ideas.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.880]   Look at "Sparta," for instance,
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.420]   or at least what I understand of "Sparta"
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.500]   from reading and also watching "300."
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:00.000]   - And reading the Wikipedia article.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.920]   - And reading the Wikipedia article about the movie,
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.560]   not the place.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:08.360]   But that's a hard, brutal place.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.560]   And was there a benefit to that?
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.660]   Like, absolutely.
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.060]   Was there a drawback to that?
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:13.900]   Absolutely.
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:14.880]   Is it sustainable?
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.120]   I would think probably not.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.340]   I mean, granted, it hasn't sustained,
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:21.520]   but I mean, that type of a thing,
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.040]   it burns too hot almost,
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:26.900]   and it destroys the host at a certain point.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.980]   And I guess that type of unforgiving nature,
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:33.880]   but entirely permissive has its own issues.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.800]   And I guess coming back to what your description
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.880]   of describing a toxic relationship
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.860]   is a very dangerous and tricky thing
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.400]   because it's almost like a bird's eye view.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.560]   You see, let's say a husband and a wife arguing.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.400]   And you're like, all right,
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.360]   well, sort of somebody hitting somebody.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.000]   I need to keep myself out of this
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.480]   because I have no idea what, I'm seeing something,
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.440]   but I don't know what's going on or why specifically.
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.480]   And again, short of it going to a place
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:03.520]   that's just out of bounds, I don't know who's right here.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.440]   I don't know who's wrong,
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.440]   and I don't know what phase of this things are in.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.280]   So I guess coming back-
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:12.840]   - And long-term what's good for both people.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.920]   - Right, it's dangerous.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.520]   So if I wanna put my finger on the scale,
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.960]   I can understand the desire to do them.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.680]   I'm like, hey guys, let's break it up.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.100]   And that may be the right thing at the time,
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:21.680]   but at the same time, I'm not sure.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:23.720]   So I think back to all of the times
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.600]   that you mentioned your coach pushing you very, very hard.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.640]   And then other times going like,
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.760]   hey, let's put it in perspective here.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.840]   I think that's an interesting thing for high performance.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.480]   And I think that we're seeing that again societally now,
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.040]   or at least maybe that's just pops up
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.080]   on my internet feed periodically.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.120]   But coaches shouldn't be allowed to do this
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.960]   or yell at this person to yell at that person.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.720]   Like, well, have you ever been, go to a boxing gym.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.520]   It's not a commercial entity, not really.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.960]   A real boxing, not LA boxing, not a UFC gym,
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.080]   like a real place.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:56.600]   You're gonna see what things are like
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.200]   when it's entirely performance-based.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.840]   Go to a wrestling room at a high level.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.600]   You know, again, there's left and right limits
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.960]   and there are such things obviously as abuse, of course,
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.320]   but, and that should never be tolerated.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:10.360]   But it's not a commercial entity.
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:13.120]   I don't need to be sweet to you if you're screwing up,
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:13.960]   if you're dropping the ball.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.680]   And in fact, recognizing that I'm not doing you a favor
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.840]   or the team a favor by being permissive
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.480]   of that type of behavior, I think is important.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.240]   Everything in its context and at its time is important.
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:26.720]   And I guess I can think again of the times
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:29.800]   that I've been put, or had put on me,
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.640]   like a great deal of pressure to do X, Y, or Z,
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.320]   or to succeed or to push for success.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:39.080]   And I can't look back fondly enough on those times.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.520]   They were tough at the time,
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.840]   but without that, I'm not sitting here.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:44.640]   Without that, I don't go from growing up
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.600]   in a very nice family in the suburbs
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.600]   to fighting at the highest level in jujitsu,
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.440]   Gi, no Gi, and now in mixed martial arts,
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.680]   starting a career at age 27.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.600]   You know, I don't, it just doesn't happen
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.160]   because people, generally speaking,
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.760]   from that background don't get pushed hard enough
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.740]   physically to be able to make that transition.
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:07.400]   And that has benefits and it has drawbacks.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.720]   You know, when you stare into the abyss, it stares back.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.160]   And I think that that's an important thing to understand.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.440]   You know, you stare long enough,
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.720]   you can become something that you don't,
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.200]   that you would be sorry that you did.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.480]   You don't look enough and you don't have perspective either.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:23.080]   You know, and I think that that's an interesting thing.
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.080]   I can speak to someone who's relatively,
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.240]   someone who's relatively articulate and reasonable.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.960]   I try to be reasonable, but you know, I'll say inspiring.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.760]   If people get crazy with me, they get a warning,
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.520]   and then I'm gonna crack 'em.
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.660]   And what did they expect?
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:38.700]   Oh, they hear the guy on an interview,
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.660]   but who did they think they were meeting?
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.420]   'Cause there's also the guy in the ring.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:44.100]   - And there's layers there too.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:47.000]   I remember training with you, it's kind of funny.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.820]   There's like, there's, well, you didn't know who I was.
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.580]   I mean, you still like, I-
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:54.980]   - You have a really good straight ankle, by the way.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:59.740]   - Yeah, that, so I don't remember what rank I was,
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:02.280]   but it might've been purple or something like that.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:07.180]   And I did some, like I, you had this look on your face,
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:09.580]   which I've often seen in black belts.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.920]   It's like, here he goes again.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.920]   Like, here's him trying this thing.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:20.420]   And then when I kind of annoyed you a little bit with it,
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:22.820]   now I get that, it was a good, like, I, you know,
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.380]   I did something somewhat effective,
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.860]   like some, like maybe a little bit off balance.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:28.180]   - Yeah.
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:30.340]   - I just peeled off a little layer of Ryan Hall
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:34.000]   to where I was like, okay, let me, let me like,
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.080]   there's like layers underneath the-
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:36.920]   - Ogres are like onions.
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.600]   - Mike Tyson's somewhere in there.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.040]   Like, so it was like, okay, this like new guy rolls in here.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:44.400]   He thinks he can do this stupid thing.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.880]   And then you started to beat the hell out of me.
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:49.520]   But the point is there's layers here
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.760]   from the guy who was being interviewed now
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.040]   to like Genghis Khan.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:54.880]   - But it's funny.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.720]   - It's all in the same body.
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:57.520]   - Right, but it's like, all of us are like that, right?
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.120]   In various different directions and recognizing that's okay.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.960]   It's just, there are consequences to all,
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.760]   every choice that we make has a consequence.
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.500]   Sometimes there's like objectively wrong
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.160]   or objectively right, but at least in my mind,
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.680]   that's a pretty small box.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:11.040]   Everything else is just, there's a consequence to that.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.240]   Do you like that consequence?
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.240]   Do you not?
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.640]   And who do I want to become?
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.640]   What do I want to try to hone myself or anyone else into?
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.940]   And also like, but this is something I've screwed up
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:22.280]   as a coach plenty of times.
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:24.760]   You know, like if someone says, if you're, if like,
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.420]   I come to them like, Lex, I really, really want to take,
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:28.760]   you know, research very seriously.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:29.920]   Like, okay, I believe you.
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.680]   Now I haven't shown you that, but I believe you.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.520]   Like, okay.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:36.800]   And now me not showing up to research or to study
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.200]   or not being up until three in the morning,
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.280]   thinking about this is no longer acceptable.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.280]   There was a time like five seconds
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:44.360]   before me making that statement that if I went to bed
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.480]   without reading the book that I needed to read, no worries.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.400]   But the second that I made that statement,
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.440]   your expectations for me changed.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.440]   And maybe it's something that's something
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.840]   that I've screwed up a whole bunch of times in my,
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.400]   as a teacher, 'cause it's an interesting thing,
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.480]   obviously, you know, being a,
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.600]   like running a martial arts school
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.180]   as your principally an athlete,
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:03.600]   is sometimes I don't pay enough attention
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.600]   to what people are doing.
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:05.560]   I just go, oh, okay.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.440]   You say X, Y, Z.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.240]   I'm like, Roger that, I believe you, cool.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:10.480]   I will now put you in category X.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:12.840]   And whether rightly or wrongly,
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.160]   like maybe this person didn't understand
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.160]   what they were asking for,
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.840]   or I didn't express this or the other,
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.680]   and it just, it caused cross wires.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.320]   And then most times you just, you hash it out,
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.320]   you have a discussion, you figure out,
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:22.880]   get to the bottom of what people are trying to do
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   or what they want.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.800]   But if I was paying more attention,
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.220]   I think I could have been a lot more effective.
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:28.240]   Or if I had more experience,
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.520]   and sometimes maybe I'm not sharp enough,
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.920]   or I don't, I'm not perceptive enough
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.560]   to be able to see what's going on.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.960]   And maybe with years more down the line,
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.340]   I'll be able to have a sharper perception.
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:38.740]   But I think that's another one of those interesting things
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:41.800]   that sometimes I would caution, or not caution,
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:44.160]   but just inform a prospective martial arts student,
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.200]   depending upon where you're going.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.920]   You know, both you and also your coach
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.440]   or other people in the room, they wear many hats.
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.260]   And sometimes there's a, I had the wrong hat on.
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.440]   You were talking to me as Lex the guy.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.800]   I didn't realize you were talking to me.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:56.920]   I thought you were talking to me as Lex the guy.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:57.760]   I didn't realize you were talking to me
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.640]   as Lex the martial artist.
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:00.620]   I'm like, oh crap, I was talking to the wrong person.
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:02.320]   So it's almost like if you had a,
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.680]   like I run my gym with my wife, she's a black belt.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.340]   So she's my wife.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:11.560]   She's my peers as a martial artist in jiu-jitsu.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.120]   - She's here by the way in judging, so.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.200]   - Exactly, all right, well, all right.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.760]   So, but a fellow black belt, and I guess like another thing.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.640]   - She doesn't have a microphone,
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.240]   so you can't hear all the trash she's talking about.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.080]   - Exactly, but it can be tough.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.640]   And that's something that we've had to work through a lot.
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.720]   And it's like looking back,
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.400]   and it's like now being where I'm at now,
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.240]   and it's easy for me to say that
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:29.200]   'cause she's in the room and I don't want her to stab me,
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.960]   just continue to slowly poison me over time.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.200]   Which frankly, I understand.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:35.520]   You know, it's the sort of thing
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:38.520]   that is now way more effective than anything else
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.200]   I could really reasonably expect to have.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.660]   But there were times when both of us, you know,
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:45.880]   were justifiably annoyed at the other
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.800]   because of crossed wires.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.240]   And sometimes, you know, you just have a disagreement
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.320]   anyway or a misunderstanding anyway.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.920]   But again, like I coach some of my friends.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.920]   I've coached my friend who I've known
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.760]   since I was four years old.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.080]   You know, sometimes I don't go,
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:58.920]   hey buddy, how you doing?
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.280]   Sometimes it's like, what the fuck are you doing?
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.120]   Put your hand over there.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:01.940]   How many times have we talked about this?
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:03.120]   And then you walk away
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.240]   and you can see him look at you crooked.
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.200]   And you're like, oh crap.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.800]   Oh yeah, he thought I was talking to his friend.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:08.640]   Yeah, well, all right,
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.000]   we need to talk this one out, hashing out.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.340]   And not, he's wrong.
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:13.000]   How could he possibly think that way?
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.520]   Like, oh no, I totally understand that.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:17.560]   But if I was 22, doesn't he know I'm a purple belt?
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:18.640]   Some nonsense like that.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.660]   And it doesn't come from a bad place,
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:22.860]   but it's just, I guess that comes back to society,
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:23.700]   to anything.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:24.820]   We only have the perspective that they have
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:26.180]   and the awareness that we have.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.200]   And so again, going back and going,
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.940]   hey guys, grace, like I don't expect,
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:32.340]   it's not fair for me to go, I fight UFC.
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.380]   Why doesn't this guy who came in as an attorney
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:36.260]   understand how hardcore this needs to be?
[01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:37.700]   I'm like, how could he?
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.180]   And at the same time though,
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:43.860]   if I'm using the language of someone that is interested
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:46.140]   in at least performance from a martial arts perspective,
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:48.140]   I understand how that could be off-putting.
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.860]   Let's say for instance, someone that's complete,
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:51.220]   like all of that would be out of bounds
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:52.560]   in their normal workplace.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.720]   But if they think of the gym as my office,
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.800]   then whether they agree or disagree with what's going on,
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.880]   they go, okay, I see why that might've happened.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.020]   Let's talk about this.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:03.100]   And we can, again, all push forward in a positive direction
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.000]   that benefits, I guess, everyone's journey
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.040]   throughout the activity.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.960]   - And on top of all that, there's moods.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:12.020]   Like I mean, especially lately,
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:16.580]   I think two days ago, maybe yesterday, no, two days ago,
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:21.300]   I've never been that cranky in my life.
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.620]   I think, I don't know what it was,
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:28.260]   but I wanted to tell everybody how much they annoyed me.
[01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:31.980]   And it was like, I was just very conscious of this feeling
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:35.420]   of like, why is this happening right now?
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:38.660]   So I consciously decided, as I usually do in those cases,
[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.420]   to not say anything to anybody.
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:41.460]   - How do you do that?
[01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:48.720]   - Well, it's, yeah, meditate because it's not,
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:53.360]   I tend to then visualize what's gonna happen in the next,
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.860]   like how is this gonna make my life better?
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:32:00.860]   Like if I say something that mean to somebody else,
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:08.420]   I have just started a conflict that will just escalate,
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:14.040]   will continue, will add more conflict to my life.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:17.380]   It'll make things, I just don't like the feeling
[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:20.440]   it will create, and so you live enough life to know
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:25.100]   that it's just like with street fighting.
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:28.100]   I would get into a lot of fights when I was younger,
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:31.920]   just on the street, but then you realize it's not
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.580]   like a jiu-jitsu match or something like that.
[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:36.180]   It's not, it'll escalate.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:39.020]   It might come back at you.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:43.420]   That person might find you again, but more importantly,
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:48.420]   the anxiety of it, of having created little enemies
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:52.660]   in this world, distorts the way you see the world.
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:56.340]   So I've noticed that like, if I'm shitty to people
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:58.700]   on the internet, which I haven't been, I think,
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:03.100]   in a long time, is like it somehow brings the shittiness
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:04.740]   to you more and more, it escalates.
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.860]   Like the more love you put out there,
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:11.860]   the more like the people who put love out like surround you.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:13.320]   - You mentioned forgiveness as well.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:16.500]   Like you said, I guess back to the original,
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.460]   the Holocaust survivor scenario, where you're like,
[01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:20.020]   oh my God, like you think of the ultimate,
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:23.100]   and like I've never experienced one billionth
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:26.180]   of that level of pain and horror, and it's like,
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:28.740]   and I can't let this little thing go.
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.140]   I guess that's an interesting thing.
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:32.420]   I think you're just making the point in your personal life,
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:33.820]   I guess, the same way, right?
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.500]   - Yeah, and on the internet, it's hard.
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:41.420]   I've somehow gotten, I mean, you've had a level
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:44.680]   of celebrity for a while, I've recently gotten some level
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:49.120]   of like celebrity, and like these people who are just shitty
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.220]   for no reason come out from all places,
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:57.220]   like calling me a fraud or anything else.
[01:33:57.220 --> 01:34:00.120]   - You ever see "Giant Silent Bob" strike back?
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.800]   They find out a movie's gonna be made about them,
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.160]   and people are talking shit on the internet,
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.080]   and they're like, what's the internet?
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.920]   And then someone shows them, and they're like, what?
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.880]   And they go to a message board, and they go to Hollywood
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.160]   to try to stop it from being made,
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.760]   and they eventually get money for their likeness,
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.300]   and they use the money to buy plane tickets
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.980]   and fly around and beat the shit out of all the people
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:15.500]   that talk bad about them.
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:16.340]   - Yeah, it's tough.
[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:18.500]   I mean, I'm having trouble with it,
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:23.020]   'cause there's people like, yeah, there's posts and forums
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.900]   and heated discussions about, is Lex Fabian a fraud?
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:28.820]   I don't know, what has he really done?
[01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:32.060]   And then there's people like, well, I think he's an all right
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:33.260]   guy, but I'm not sure.
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:37.340]   There's literal discussions, and I'm like,
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:41.940]   if you increase the level of celebrity,
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:45.100]   there's going to be, one of the things that hurts my heart
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:49.020]   a little bit is some level of toxicity around Joe Rogan,
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:50.020]   for example.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:54.420]   There's communities of people that now talk about him
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:56.860]   selling out, for example, all that kind of stuff.
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:01.860]   And I don't, and Joe, I've talked to him about it,
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:05.740]   is amazing that he says don't read the comments,
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:08.020]   he legitimately doesn't read the comments.
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:10.900]   His heart and his soul doesn't give a damn
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:12.180]   about the comments.
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:14.740]   All he gives a damn about is his friends.
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:18.260]   Like one of the things that's really inspiring to me,
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:20.480]   and that's, I've had a conversation with him offline
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.860]   about Spotify and the removed episodes.
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:25.700]   People are curious for me.
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:26.540]   - What's Spotify?
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:32.380]   - It's a thing on the internet where I think you can play
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:34.460]   Taylor Swift songs on.
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:35.780]   - I'll write that down.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:38.740]   - But you can also now play Joe Rogan podcast.
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:39.580]   - Oh, cool.
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:42.220]   - And they gave him $100 million.
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:44.900]   So that's, you know, that's--
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:46.300]   - That's awesome, good for Joe.
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.540]   - Yeah.
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:50.220]   But the thing I've had a discussion with him,
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:51.980]   and I made a video about it that I took down
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:54.420]   because of the toxicity, is like,
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:55.900]   it's hard to put into words,
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:36:00.580]   but he will give away the 100 million in a second
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:04.300]   if he ever has to compromise who he is.
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.660]   Like he doesn't, I mean, he already said,
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:09.500]   as he talked about, he's made quote unquote,
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.740]   fuck you money a long time ago.
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:14.540]   He doesn't need any more money.
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:16.060]   He doesn't care.
[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:18.100]   It's nice to have money, whatever,
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.340]   but he'll give it away.
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:24.340]   So it's nice to see when people like him
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:27.500]   at a level of celebrity, level of success,
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:31.580]   and financial success, don't change at all.
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:34.140]   They're just the same thing that makes you happy
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:37.940]   is talking, in his case, talking shit with his friends,
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:39.260]   in the case of most of us, really,
[01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:43.540]   just hanging out with friends, doing the things you love,
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:46.180]   in his case, doing the things he loves
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:50.700]   without any, like, you know, the Texas way,
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:55.700]   the freedom, like without any corporate bureaucracy bullshit
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:37:00.060]   that rolls in and says, well, maybe you shouldn't say fuck,
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:02.340]   you know, like more than 20 times a podcast
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:03.180]   or something like that.
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.220]   Those kinds of like rules, like people,
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:08.340]   like he says in a suit and tie, they show up and say stuff.
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:11.660]   - Oddly enough, people that could never have done
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.980]   what he's done. - What he does, yeah, exactly.
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:16.580]   And it's kind of inspiring to see that.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:21.580]   And I hope people realize how special of a human he is.
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:27.580]   He's inspired people like me, like I'm a scientist, right?
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:30.060]   So he inspired somebody like me
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:32.380]   from a very different walk of life
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:37.140]   to be like kind to others, to be open-minded.
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:40.100]   I don't know, that is a special dude.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:42.980]   So like people need to support that and treasure that
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:47.980]   as opposed to be toxic about it.
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:53.180]   I mean, what I, 'cause people really, for a long time,
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:55.740]   have told me that it would be awesome
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:57.860]   if Ryan Halson goes on Joe Rogan.
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:00.260]   I definitely think that would be an awesome thing.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:02.340]   Have you listened to Joe?
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:05.820]   Has he been a part of your life in some kind of way?
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:07.980]   - Well, Joe's always, I remember watching Joe
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:09.940]   on "Fear Factor" when I was a little kid, which is cool.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:12.540]   So I've actually gotten to like from a bird's eye view,
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:16.300]   watch his kind of just path through life.
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:18.900]   But one of the things that I always appreciate,
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.940]   and again, I barely know Joe other than to shake his hand.
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.940]   He interviewed me briefly in the ring
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.380]   after the BJ Penn fight.
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:27.700]   But one of the things that I've always admired about Joe
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:30.820]   is that I think he had fucking money from the start.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:33.540]   I think that $0 is fucking money for Joe.
[01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.500]   I think, and that's something I respect about him
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:39.500]   a great deal because as you say, it's interesting to watch.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.180]   It's like you hope that, George St. Pierre's like this.
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:44.020]   It's really neat.
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:45.220]   I'm not super close to George,
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:46.380]   but we're teammates at TriStar
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:47.860]   and he's never been anything but a gentleman.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:49.140]   He's one of those people that,
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:50.860]   if you didn't know George was famous,
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:52.460]   when you walk into the gym, you'd have no idea.
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:54.020]   He's not holding court, not doing it.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:56.940]   He's just training and he'll help out an amateur doing this.
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:58.380]   If you have a question for him, he'll help me.
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:59.580]   Like I'm nobody, man.
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:01.300]   He would give me advice and train me.
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:02.420]   It was super cool.
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:04.220]   And he didn't kill me, which I really appreciated.
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:05.220]   He's a gentleman.
[01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:08.340]   But it's like you meet someone and you go,
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:11.620]   man, it's so cool that this is the guy who's the best,
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:14.180]   that this is the guy who has been successful.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:17.020]   And then you go, well, why are they successful?
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:18.260]   Like I said, true to what they're doing,
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:19.100]   they haven't changed.
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:19.940]   They're the same as they've been.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:21.700]   And I remember I got to TriStar in 2012
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:24.240]   and George was already, George St. Pierre.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:25.900]   But I remember watching and talking to people
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:27.020]   and they're like, oh man, George is the same
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:27.860]   as he's always been.
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:29.500]   And it's neat, I see him in the gym training now
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:30.700]   and again, giving advice now.
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:33.420]   And it seems like Joe has always been consistent.
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:36.540]   And it's neat to watch someone not compromise
[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:38.300]   on their values and not change who they are.
[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:40.100]   And not, you know, periodically, like, you know, again,
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:40.940]   we all make mistakes.
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:42.580]   Like you have a bad day or this or that,
[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:43.900]   and an apology needs to be issued,
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:45.620]   or even my bad or this or that.
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:47.140]   And you're like, yeah, and they just move on.
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:49.100]   They're not afraid to be themselves
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:50.900]   and they're not afraid to be wrong.
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:52.100]   They're not afraid to make a mistake.
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:53.380]   As you mentioned, open-minded.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:54.940]   So I'm like, so what are the correct beliefs
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:56.780]   to have about this that I know going in,
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.540]   everyone's gonna be okay with what I'm saying?
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:00.220]   Which is usually the beginning of a conversation
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:01.640]   that's gonna go nowhere, right?
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:06.100]   And it's neat to see the things, I guess,
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:08.700]   that he's created on his own as a result
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.960]   of the authenticity that's there.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:12.540]   And it reminds me of like Dave Chappelle.
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:14.680]   And again, I don't know, I've never met Dave,
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:17.020]   but it's neat to see someone that's clearly,
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:20.860]   again, authentic in their own way, doing their own thing.
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:24.200]   And because of that, they're above the corporate nonsense.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.820]   But what's funny, I think the message behind all of it is,
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.140]   hey guys, we all are.
[01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:30.940]   I can't promise you that I'm gonna have money.
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:32.700]   Joe couldn't promise you that he's gonna have money.
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:34.180]   Now it ended up working out,
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:38.380]   but he was above that nonsense from the jump.
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:39.980]   And he just continued to be above it
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:41.860]   by never giving it any mind and just going like,
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:43.100]   yeah, I'm gonna be a reasonable person.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:44.020]   I'm gonna try to learn.
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:45.260]   I'm gonna try to grow.
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:47.740]   And if I say something annoying,
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:49.020]   you can come and talk to me about it.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:49.980]   We can get to the bottom of it.
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:52.740]   And I'm like, if I need to say my bad, thanks, appreciate it.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:54.640]   And I will, and if I don't need to, I'm like,
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:55.760]   hey, I still appreciate the talk.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.600]   Thanks, man.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.640]   I'll shake your hand and we carry on
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:58.600]   and we go our separate ways
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.040]   and hopefully I'll treat you with respect.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.440]   You treat me with respect.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.560]   And that's about it.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.760]   And I guess, I think it's a lesson that it can work out
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.600]   no matter what.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.920]   You don't have to kowtow to like these weird powers that be,
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.680]   and whether you're at this level or at this level,
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.760]   but you can live your life the way that you want.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.360]   And as you mentioned, talk shit with your friends,
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:17.200]   hang out, be happy.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.960]   And it just so happens that that resonates with people.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.360]   It actually reminds me of like speaking at MIT
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.780]   and being in Boston is like a good will hunting.
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:26.060]   You know, like, again, that's what do you really wanna do?
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:27.740]   He could have gone this way, could have gone that way.
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:29.980]   And it was an interesting story, but it's like,
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:32.180]   this person wants to hang out with his buddies
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:33.540]   and wants to do other things.
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:34.780]   And again, happens to be brilliant
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:36.920]   and happens to be able to do all these other things.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:40.100]   But there was, I guess it's like, at least in my mind,
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:42.060]   a story of authenticity as well.
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:43.180]   And it was both the same thing
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.620]   in the Robin Williams character.
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:47.540]   And I just think that that's a message
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:49.780]   'cause watching things occur on the internet
[01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:52.840]   as they do now, so many things playing out in the public eye,
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.120]   I feel like so many private
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.880]   or otherwise formerly private discussions and disputes
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.880]   and interactions now become, they all have a,
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.920]   well, what is this gonna say when it goes public?
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.540]   So how can I couch what I'm saying?
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:05.920]   Or how can I word this in a way
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:07.160]   that's gonna get people on my side
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.680]   to use the right buzzwords and not use the wrong buzzwords?
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:12.440]   And it's just neat to see people, you know,
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.160]   in their own way, flip the bird to the head
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.400]   because I think that that's just not how a human being
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.840]   is meant to think or interact.
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:24.140]   - I'm curious what you think about the thing
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:28.220]   that recently has, you know, me hosting this podcast,
[01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:32.900]   I sometimes think about who should I talk to and not
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:38.220]   in terms of like, it's the old Hitler question.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.980]   Now, Hitler, I would definitely talk to
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:42.300]   because, post-World War II,
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:44.100]   because everyone knows he's evil.
[01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:47.860]   The question whether you talk to Hitler in 1937,
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:52.860]   like when people who are really students of what's going on
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:56.400]   understand that this is a very dangerous human being.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:01.840]   But a large number of part of the world are like,
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:04.340]   well, he's a leader who cares for Germany.
[01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:07.700]   So the question I have, it's interesting to me,
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.140]   it involves a particular person named,
[01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:13.340]   who also lives in Austin, Texas, named Alex Jones.
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:14.740]   I don't know if you're familiar with the guy.
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:16.300]   - I am familiar with Mr. Jones.
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:17.980]   (laughing)
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:21.300]   - I've actually recently just listened to Infowars,
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:25.940]   like one episode of his show, I guess, that he does every day
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:29.460]   and it kind of reminded me of a time in college
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:31.420]   when I drank too much tequila.
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:34.060]   There's no turning back.
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:34.900]   - No.
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:37.940]   - It's like, the mistakes you make that,
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:43.120]   I mean, you don't know where you're gonna wake up,
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:46.460]   you don't know who you're gonna kill or not kill
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:48.080]   or steal or rob.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:49.860]   It's unclear.
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:54.280]   So it felt like I was getting pulled into a dark place
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:58.120]   where pretty much everybody is a pedophile
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:00.900]   that's trying to control the world.
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:03.480]   So Bill Gates definitely is a pedophile.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:06.140]   Everybody in power, anybody in power,
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:09.940]   there's a kind of a deep skepticism about power
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:12.120]   and a conspiratorial way to see the world
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:17.120]   where everything is like dark forces in all corners.
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.500]   It's like the way you feel when you're a kid
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:22.020]   that there's a monster hiding in the closet.
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:23.860]   - Which is also why you leap over the bed
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:25.140]   from like four feet away.
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:26.260]   - There's a strategy.
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:27.100]   - Yes.
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:28.860]   - But he says that you're just being weak,
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:30.260]   you need to look under the bed.
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.020]   Under the bed, there's monsters
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:34.260]   and we need to be aware of them because they're growing,
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:36.420]   they're multiplying, you should be--
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:37.500]   - And they're touching children.
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.540]   - They're touching children, exactly.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:40.900]   So it all connects.
[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:45.600]   But when I listened to him and I thought about
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.460]   like do I wanna talk to him on this podcast, for example,
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:54.780]   when I listened to his conversation with Joe Rogan,
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:56.300]   the two times he talked on there,
[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:59.660]   to me it was somehow entertaining.
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.900]   Like it was fun to listen to.
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:06.700]   It's fun to listen to a madman go on for four hours
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:09.180]   because it's almost like theater.
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:12.620]   Like this is what I talked to Joe about
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:16.140]   when people try to censor Alex Jones.
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:20.340]   Joe says that the people who try to censor him
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:22.580]   don't give enough credit to the intelligence
[01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:24.980]   of human beings to like understand
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:29.780]   that what a person says on a large platform
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:32.500]   does not necessarily, is not the truth.
[01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:35.360]   You can be a madman and say crazy things
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:40.360]   and people are intelligent enough to hear certain things
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:43.460]   when they're said like the earth is flat,
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:47.900]   they can be intelligent enough not to all of a sudden
[01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.620]   start believing that the earth is flat.
[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:52.120]   Like they're intelligent enough to sort of
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:55.520]   select different ideas and be able to enjoy
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.620]   the theater of a particular ridiculous
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:01.180]   over-the-top conversation without being sort of influenced
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:05.180]   the way they start believing like toxic set of beliefs.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:08.180]   Now there's a lot of sort of
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.920]   other kinds of people, especially now with cancel culture
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.800]   that say, well, you don't want to give platform
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.040]   to crazy people that ultimately whose beliefs
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:21.000]   might lead to dangerous consequences.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.740]   Like, and I see it very often now with conspiracy theories
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:28.400]   that go like way too far.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:33.400]   Like for example, I'm not, I haven't looked into it.
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.780]   So I'm sorry, I will look into it.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:40.780]   But it hurts my heart to see that on Bill Gates,
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:46.800]   in my opinion, the person who has saved
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:50.460]   and improved more lives than probably any human in history,
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:54.520]   literally, because of the money he's invested in helping,
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:58.120]   like just the work he's done on like malaria in Africa,
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.960]   the number of people he's helped is huge.
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.400]   And yet every interview, anything you see now on Bill Gates,
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:09.360]   everyone is calling him, I believe, haven't looked into it,
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.460]   but I believe everyone's calling him a pedophile.
[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:13.320]   I don't know the full structure of it,
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:17.960]   but it's just a very, it feels like an army of like,
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:20.000]   it feels like it's hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:20.960]   That's what it feels like.
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.940]   It might be a much smaller percentage,
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:24.840]   but it feels like a huge number of people
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:25.840]   are calling him a pedophile.
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.680]   So that's the flip side.
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:29.360]   If you allow, if you give platform
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.520]   to conspiracy theories like that,
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:34.120]   then you start to have bigger and bigger percent
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:36.560]   of the population believe in these crazy things.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.200]   I just, I wanted to put it out there
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:41.880]   'cause I don't know what to think of that.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.260]   If you put yourself in Joe Rogan's shoes,
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:46.400]   if you put yourself in my shoes,
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.480]   if you put yourself just in your own shoes.
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:50.720]   - I'm in my shoes right now.
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:52.080]   - Great, if you're staying in your shoes,
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:52.920]   just stay in your shoes.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.760]   - Can I have yours?
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.040]   (laughing)
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:58.280]   - Would you talk, would you give platform
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:00.080]   to people like Alex Jones?
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:06.780]   Would you talk to somebody like Alex Jones or not?
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.840]   - Yes, I would.
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:11.000]   And I feel very strongly about this, honestly.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.520]   Well, I think that it's an interesting thing.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:17.440]   And I would just say a lot of times,
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:20.000]   I can understand very, very clearly
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.280]   why people would take issue with the idea of,
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.300]   I guess what they proceed to be amplifying,
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:28.680]   this man's voice, this man's reach,
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:32.160]   as a demonstrable negative.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:35.880]   But I think when you take a step back further,
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:41.240]   the cure is more damaging than the disease
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:42.840]   and significantly so.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:48.400]   I guess, I think that I'm very, very wary of,
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.960]   I think being where, you mentioned Alex Jones being wary
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:52.560]   of power and people with it.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.920]   That's, a lot of times, there's a lot of truth
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.480]   and validity to crazy things that people say.
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:01.920]   It's the conspiracy theories that stick
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:03.620]   are the ones that sound credible,
[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:06.580]   at least quasi-credible in some aspect.
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:07.640]   And it's almost like it seems to me
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.540]   like an anchor in people's mind.
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:11.520]   And it is also funny to me, obviously,
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:14.200]   that Bill Gates, it's so funny to tar people
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.400]   with things like pedophile, racist, rapist.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:19.160]   Like these are things that we're basically trying
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:21.380]   to pick words that no one can ever support someone
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:22.760]   who does these things.
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:25.280]   And that's, you know.
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.560]   - And that changes year by year.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:30.160]   Currently, pedophile is totally in as a thing
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:33.480]   to call somebody just as a,
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:35.960]   it used to be communist or Marxist.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:38.480]   - Cleveland Browns fan, you know, like, come on.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.600]   You know, who would want that?
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:41.440]   - Actually, nobody likes the Browns, so I'll agree with you.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:42.720]   - I felt like that was, that's why I picked them.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:44.760]   That's the trick, is you find a group of people
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.680]   that nobody likes, we're good here.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.920]   All right, that's the move.
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.640]   But yeah, that's a creepy thing, though,
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.960]   because that is the creepy thing.
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:54.400]   It's like, people are always looking for,
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:55.680]   groups of people are always looking for,
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:58.400]   and I find this really deeply disturbing,
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:01.040]   like, hey, so who's the guy that we can all get away with,
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.800]   you know, just treating like dirt?
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.200]   Who's the guy that I can be a dick to,
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.840]   I can just walk up and punch in the face,
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.360]   and no one's gonna say anything?
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:11.800]   And it's, even if, you know, people do that,
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:15.120]   whether it's literal Nazis or someone that I called Nazi,
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:16.920]   you know, I guess what's the bigger issue?
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:20.380]   This person's ridiculous beliefs or what I'm doing?
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:22.240]   And you mentioned Hitler before,
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.360]   and obviously, Mein Kampf being, you know,
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:27.000]   like, the outline for some of the things he did later,
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.920]   and when the evil, was it always there?
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:32.360]   Did it take root later on or flourish later on?
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:37.120]   But was Adolf Hitler a problem because he had crazy ideas
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.920]   or because he did things?
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.800]   I think, it's 'cause, it's not, I think,
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.240]   I know it's because he did things.
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:45.360]   Now, if I'm gonna start punishing thought crime,
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:47.480]   I'm gonna have to start punishing thought crime,
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:49.280]   and that's a terrifying concept.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:50.880]   Even if I'm right about the certain,
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.320]   about the objectively correct,
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:55.080]   about the things that I decide to call out of bounds,
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.800]   who put me in charge and made me arbiter of good taste,
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:01.120]   and how long until I decide that something else is,
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:01.960]   is out of bounds?
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.340]   It's always a sliding scale,
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:05.200]   or it's always a sliding standard,
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.900]   and I find that, you know, to be more of a concern
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:10.240]   than people doing crazy things,
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.200]   because I guess if you mention Alex Jones, you know,
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.640]   putting out ridiculous ideas, ridiculous theories,
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:17.560]   I think that most people don't look at Alex Jones
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:18.800]   as a credible person.
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:20.600]   Now, I'm not gonna pretend to be deeply read
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:22.280]   into all of his beliefs or the things
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:24.080]   that he's trying to peddle,
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:27.600]   but there's plenty of things that are quasi-mainstream
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:30.040]   that I think on, with this side or that side,
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:31.960]   that maybe not comparably ridiculous,
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:34.840]   but are, you know, particularly in hindsight,
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:37.720]   or, you know, are, were not, or silly,
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:42.720]   and I guess the idea of getting a group of people together
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.840]   to decide what we're not going to tolerate
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:46.740]   is a very, very tricky thing,
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:49.840]   and I think that, you know, it reminds me of law,
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.000]   or, you know, even, you know, religion,
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:53.840]   when it gets to, like,
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:54.960]   what are the things that we don't like?
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:57.000]   How do we feel about rape?
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.760]   It's like, no, under no circumstances
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:00.280]   is that an acceptable behavior.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.480]   Murder, no, that's not an acceptable behavior.
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:05.880]   Killing, I don't know, kind of depends on the situation.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:06.720]   Are you at war?
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:07.600]   Were you justified?
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.640]   Were you acting in self-defense?
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:13.660]   Okay, so it's not, now, murder is a specific type of killing
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.640]   the same way, you know, other things should be
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:16.760]   a specific type of something else,
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:18.280]   but I guess we draw the line on murder.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.200]   We say, if you want to exist in our society,
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.280]   you can't do this.
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:23.820]   This cannot be done, and then we go theft.
[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:25.620]   If someone said, hey, I murdered that guy,
[01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:27.040]   can you understand where I'm coming from?
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:28.320]   I might say, yeah, I'll hear you out.
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.760]   Doesn't mean that I think you're right,
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:32.080]   but I'm like, have you ever been wronged so deeply
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:34.200]   that you could imagine that you could kill someone?
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:35.080]   I'm like, no, I haven't,
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.800]   but I could conceptualize someone doing that,
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:39.080]   and I'm like, yeah, okay, and you still need to go,
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:41.060]   you still need to face, you know, criminal justice
[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:42.320]   as we have it in our system,
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:44.040]   or at least that's how we've decided.
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:45.320]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:47.040]   You have to be able to, like, there's,
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:51.040]   if you look at the history of discourse in this country,
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:53.200]   I think it's still true, but I'm not sure.
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:55.360]   It's changed since 9/11,
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:53:00.360]   is it used to be impossible to criticize a soldier.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:05.800]   It was easier to criticize war.
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:07.760]   It was harder to criticize soldiers
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:10.920]   for allowing themselves to be the tools of war.
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:13.840]   I tend to be, maybe it's the Russian upbringing,
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:16.040]   it's the combat thing.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:20.120]   I tend to romanticize war and soldiers.
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:22.400]   I see soldiers as heroes,
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:25.960]   but I've also heard people that not only say
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:29.520]   that soldiers are, war is bad,
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:32.380]   they say soldiers are bad.
[01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:33.840]   - What's their argument?
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:36.440]   - It's the kind of a libertarian view
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:41.440]   that they're basically slaves to evil, right?
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:45.180]   War is evil, and they're given,
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:50.180]   they are suspending their moral and ethical,
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:54.360]   like, duties as a human being to become the tools of evil.
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:57.120]   That's sort of the argument, if you see war as evil.
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:01.160]   I mean, I think it's useful to hear that,
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:04.160]   but there for a long part in history,
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:06.720]   that was completely unacceptable.
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:08.760]   Same with abortion.
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:12.800]   If you see abortion as murder,
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.000]   I mean, if I classify it in that,
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.760]   if I put it in that basket.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:23.660]   - It starts, we're living in the midst of a genocide.
[01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:26.680]   - Looked at from that perspective,
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:29.360]   could you feel how people could be deeply upset by abortion?
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:30.200]   You go, of course.
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:31.360]   Looked at from a different perspective,
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:33.080]   you say, I don't believe it to be murder.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:34.480]   That's not how I see it.
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.440]   Then you go, oh, well, if that's the genesis
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.440]   of your thought process, then you're like, yeah, okay.
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:40.840]   Now I see how we can come to a different thing,
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:44.160]   but I guess we go, well, abortion is murder, period.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:47.200]   Therefore, if you support it, you support murder.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:49.640]   That's a convenient way for me to tar you, right?
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:52.480]   But I guess that's kind of coming back to the Alec Jones.
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:55.240]   - It's the nuance.
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:57.360]   You have to have the nuance in these kinds of conversations.
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:59.280]   - And I have to be willing to have the conversation
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:00.480]   and I have to be willing to sit down.
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:03.560]   If I can't sit down across from like the most violently,
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:07.280]   racist, angry, hypothetical, internet, conceived person
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.720]   that none of us have ever actually met in real life,
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.840]   but hopefully not, and go like,
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:15.120]   well, of course I believe that this person's wrong,
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:17.040]   but allow me to change, do my best.
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:19.200]   I'll hear them out and I'll go, no, I can go point by point
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:21.000]   and explain why this guy or this girl is wrong
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.640]   and hopefully bring them over to a more reasonable position
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:25.200]   where they will have better beliefs
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:27.240]   and they will like objectively better beliefs
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:29.040]   and beliefs that will,
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:30.600]   and they'll treat other people better.
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.160]   Why would I wanna marginalize this person?
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:33.200]   Now I might not wanna talk,
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.640]   I might not wanna invite them to my barbecue
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:36.320]   if they're acting like a jerk all the time,
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.840]   but how could I, would it not make the world a better place
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:40.160]   if I'd hear them out and they go, look,
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.600]   if you're gonna sit down and talk with me,
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:42.920]   we're gonna have to have a discussion.
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:44.200]   I'll hear what you have to say.
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.480]   And if I can't explain to someone
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:50.080]   why their ridiculous belief is wrong,
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:52.720]   then I must not be so confident in my position.
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:53.800]   And I guess that's where I come back
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:55.600]   to the Alex Jones thing, as you mentioned,
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:58.960]   with Bill Gates and you're much more familiar
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:00.960]   with the specifics of all the good that he's done,
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:04.120]   but again, he's been an unbelievable force for good
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:05.520]   in this world.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:09.840]   You can list A, B, C, D things that the man has done,
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:13.320]   that his foundation has done, and positive things.
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:15.360]   And then the other people could speculate
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:18.920]   about ridiculous, crazy levels of evil,
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:21.320]   but you can't produce any evidence for that sort of thing.
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:22.160]   Because if you could,
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:23.880]   the man would find himself in some trouble.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:26.720]   And anyway, I guess what I would say is that,
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.280]   you can't force me to accept the truth,
[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:32.120]   the same way you could write down two plus two equals four
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.120]   on a piece of paper and show me how it works,
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.680]   and I could say, nah, but that doesn't make it not true.
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:38.360]   And you've still given yourself an opportunity
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:39.200]   to present your case.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:40.440]   You've presented it to me.
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:43.320]   And you've also, for anyone listening and watching,
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:46.920]   you've been able to critically assess what's gone on,
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.800]   or critically address back and forth,
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:50.240]   kind of the discourse.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.360]   And I think that you almost,
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:52.600]   you're making your case for the public.
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:56.720]   So I guess like, when it comes to just never,
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:58.040]   not engaging with these people,
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.360]   that seems to me to be cowardly.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.200]   And I think that that's something
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.840]   that we're seeing in society right now.
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:05.440]   I think we're seeing a crisis of courage in society
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:06.880]   all over the place.
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:09.240]   And I think that's where we're seeing poor leadership.
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:11.800]   I think we're seeing understandable things
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:14.200]   happening everywhere, but we need stronger voices
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:17.040]   and stronger beliefs that have a conviction
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.080]   and are willing to engage with others,
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:21.200]   not just turning them to a shouting contest and not,
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.600]   I didn't win because there's more of me.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:24.040]   Oh, I outvoted you.
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:26.400]   That's nice too, but that's a stand in for bullets.
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:28.080]   That's saying I won because there's more of me.
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:29.440]   That doesn't mean that I'm right.
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:32.240]   Because plenty of horrible and unpopular now things
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:34.320]   have been very, very deeply popular in the past
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:35.640]   and would have won a popular vote.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:36.840]   Does that make them right?
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:38.160]   I'd say clearly not.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:41.400]   So I guess you'd hope that we engage with these people
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:43.120]   and that you can do your best to bring them over
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:44.360]   to a more reasonable position
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:45.600]   if you believe that you have one.
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.600]   And if you can't, well, at least you made the effort.
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:49.040]   And I think that that's something where martial arts
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.160]   shows the value.
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:51.600]   It's like, do you know if you're gonna go
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:52.440]   win your next fight?
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:53.560]   I'm like, I have no idea.
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:56.040]   I will proceed forward with full effort.
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:58.480]   And I will fight with dignity.
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:00.520]   I'll fight with honor and I'll fight with courage.
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:02.560]   And I'll use everything that I have
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.240]   and I will play within the bounds of the game.
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:05.360]   And that's that.
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:06.720]   And the result will be what it'll be,
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.120]   but I will walk into and out of that ring
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:09.080]   with my head held high
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:10.640]   because I will know that I did my part.
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:11.560]   I did my job.
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:14.520]   The outcome, the specific outcome is not in my control.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.360]   It's just strongly in my influence.
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.880]   And I think that that's something that helped me,
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:20.000]   that martial arts has taught me
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.880]   because other times, even when I was successful
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:23.960]   or unsuccessful, I would focus on,
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:26.200]   if I won, I won, therefore I'm good.
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:27.560]   I lost, therefore I'm bad.
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:29.760]   This other guy won or lost, therefore,
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.440]   as opposed to evaluating their method.
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:32.560]   And I think it's so easy
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:34.160]   when we're taking a bird's eye view of things
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:36.360]   to not evaluate how someone's doing things.
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:38.040]   You're not evaluating my process.
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:39.480]   You're simply evaluating my outcome.
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:41.440]   And I could have stumbled into something very, very good
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.720]   or very, very bad.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:44.600]   And we can look back and I think that's the value of history.
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:46.640]   I mean, I don't mean to get on my dang high horse,
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:47.720]   but it's like this value of history
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:49.240]   is we can see the unbroken chain
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:51.640]   or the chain of events that led us somewhere.
[01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:53.720]   And then only with the eyes of history
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:54.960]   can we truly evaluate things
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:57.280]   unless we're in the room watching it happen.
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:59.280]   And I guess that's again,
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:02.680]   where we start to go most of the big, bad, scary things
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:04.360]   that have happened in history
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:07.000]   that are done particularly on an industrial scale,
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.560]   which implies governmental power and things like that,
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:10.960]   or the equivalent,
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:13.280]   involve groups of people getting together and going,
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:15.000]   "Hey, we're not gonna deal with that guy."
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.120]   Giant groups of people.
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:18.600]   So maybe we're right this time,
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:20.200]   but maybe we're wrong next time.
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:22.200]   And I guess I would be back to the Gandalf
[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:23.080]   putting on the one ring.
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:24.320]   I would be very, very hesitant
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:26.080]   even if we thought we were in the right
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:30.280]   to simply try to marginalize just on general principle,
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:31.800]   even people like Alex Jones
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:34.040]   whom on their face are pretty ridiculous.
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:35.800]   Like you said, you should sit down with Adolf Hitler
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:36.880]   and talk to the man.
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:38.240]   - I agree with you.
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:39.840]   To play a little devil's advocate.
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:40.680]   - Please.
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:44.560]   - Alex Jones might be a bad example,
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:47.480]   but if we look at, because he has a face, he is a human.
[01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.820]   He's a real person.
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:53.820]   There's also trolls on the internet for Chan.
[01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:59.720]   The worry I have with those folks is that,
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:01.480]   and there might be parallels to martial arts,
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:04.000]   is they practice guerrilla warfare.
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:09.000]   Meaning they don't necessarily want to arrive at the truth.
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:14.040]   They just always want to cut at the ankles of the powerful.
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:17.600]   Like they want to always break down the powerful.
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:22.600]   And even if they, I mean, they turn everything into a game.
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:26.560]   So they, let's see if we can make the world,
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:28.120]   let's see if we can make a trend
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:30.680]   that Bill Gates is a pedophile, right?
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:31.820]   They make it into a game.
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:33.620]   They get excited about this game.
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:35.000]   They see the powerful.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.600]   Let's see if we can convince that,
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:39.360]   like who is the most positive person we can think of?
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:41.440]   Let's see if we can turn them into evil.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:44.800]   And they've tried that with like everybody.
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:47.680]   And it seems to stick, and they're good at it.
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:50.120]   Some would argue,
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:52.480]   or whatever you think about our current president,
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:55.080]   that he has some elements of that,
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:58.600]   which is he's figured out whatever this music
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:01.000]   of social discourse that's going on,
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.940]   he's figured out how to always troll
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:08.940]   the mainstream flow of consciousness, the media.
[02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:11.620]   He always kind of says stuff
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:14.420]   that annoys a very large number of people,
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:16.180]   and he enjoys that.
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:17.860]   Because it's like taking the powerful,
[02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:20.140]   taking the way things were before,
[02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:23.580]   and he shakes it up by saying the most inappropriate thing,
[02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:26.220]   almost on purpose or instinctually and so on.
[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:29.900]   The problem I have with that is that doesn't,
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:34.940]   the powerful thing there is it brings
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:38.700]   those in power down a notch.
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:40.020]   That's a great thing.
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:43.540]   The negative thing is it doesn't push us closer
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:48.540]   to a nuanced, careful, rigorous discourse towards truth.
[02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:51.300]   It's like showing up to a party and just like starting
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:55.240]   to yell, it doesn't create a good conversation.
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:57.260]   It just makes everything into a game
[02:01:57.260 --> 02:01:59.900]   where truth doesn't even seem like a thing
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:02.580]   we can even hope to achieve.
[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:04.260]   - That makes sense, and I guess as you mentioned,
[02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:05.260]   we'll come back to another movie,
[02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:06.500]   'cause I don't do books, I do movies.
[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.460]   Some people just wanna watch the world burn, right?
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:13.460]   And I guess that's a creepy, creepy kind of urge
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:15.100]   that some people have.
[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:16.740]   And then also is some people, you're like,
[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:17.620]   hey, would you like to throw a brick
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:18.580]   through that glass window?
[02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:20.100]   You're like, yeah, sure.
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:21.420]   Like, no, I'm not gonna do that,
[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:25.020]   because I think about what's going to occur.
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:26.900]   Like something's gonna be hurt, someone's property,
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:28.180]   you're not gonna do it, versus, hey,
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:29.020]   you wanna see what'll happen?
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:30.060]   You're like, yeah, sure.
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:32.260]   Kids are always like, I have my son,
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:34.700]   he just grabs Spider-Man and drops him on the table.
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:35.620]   Spider-Man fell.
[02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:36.980]   Like, Spider-Man didn't fall, Sean.
[02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:39.980]   Like, you dropped him, you knocked him off the table,
[02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:41.020]   and he'll grin.
[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:45.740]   And basically, it's an interesting thing, like you said,
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:48.020]   playing that these people are appealing to,
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:51.620]   and also almost like the little dog factor
[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:53.740]   of like people do wanna watch the powerful
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:55.300]   get taken down a notch for all the good
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:56.500]   and the not good of that.
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:58.460]   There's plenty of people, it seems to me,
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:01.380]   that have found their way to incredibly high positions.
[02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:03.340]   Some have just found themselves there,
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:05.220]   and many, many, many, many, many people,
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:07.860]   you know, men and women of all backgrounds,
[02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:09.300]   are brilliant and have worked hard.
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:10.380]   And yeah, of course there's luck,
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:12.500]   and there's luck into everything.
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:13.580]   There, you know, LeBron James,
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:15.140]   in spite of being the best basketball player
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:17.500]   on God's green earth, is fortunate
[02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:18.980]   that he didn't get hit by a car.
[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:21.140]   You know, it's fortunate that he didn't tear his knee,
[02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:23.620]   but thankfully, we get to see all these things.
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:27.800]   You know, but I guess it's,
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:31.500]   if people don't have any skin in the game,
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:32.500]   you never know what they're gonna do.
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:34.060]   And I think that's the problem with the internet,
[02:03:34.060 --> 02:03:37.260]   you know, that people get to be nameless, be faceless.
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:39.260]   That's why guerrilla fighters are outside
[02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:40.220]   of the bounds of war.
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:41.780]   Like you don't have a uniform on.
[02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:43.260]   You're like, I don't know who you're from.
[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:46.060]   You don't get the same treatment that a soldier gets.
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:48.460]   For, and people go, well, that's crazy.
[02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:50.300]   And actually there's reasons for this,
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:53.220]   because otherwise people are able to assail things,
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:56.180]   and there's no one responsible.
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:57.020]   There's no way to go and say,
[02:03:57.020 --> 02:03:58.500]   hey, where did this come from?
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:03:59.420]   What's the root of this?
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:00.700]   How can I address this?
[02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:02.340]   And I think that's the problem of the internet,
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:03.180]   it's the problem of Twitter,
[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:04.180]   it's the problem of places like 4chan.
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:06.620]   I wouldn't mind seeing that type of stuff go away,
[02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:08.820]   if I'm frank, but that's not the same thing
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:11.860]   as people with a face, people who are willing
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:14.480]   to stand there and say, hi, my name is so-and-so.
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:15.900]   Even if I have ridiculous beliefs,
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:17.460]   hopefully, you know, people will hear me out,
[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:19.300]   and then if I'm wrong, educate me.
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:22.660]   But I guess you hope that the real, I guess,
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:26.340]   in my mind, antidote to all of this silliness is education.
[02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:29.060]   And I think that that's something that we're,
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:31.540]   you know, critical thinking is not necessarily,
[02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:32.900]   I went to school in America,
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:34.280]   and I feel very fortunate,
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:37.700]   but critical thinking is not something that's focused on.
[02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:38.700]   I mean, and it's tough,
[02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:40.220]   it's almost like talking about jujitsu.
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:41.480]   It's tough to teach critical thinking
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:42.420]   when I don't know any words.
[02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:43.420]   You have to teach me techniques,
[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:45.060]   you can't teach me to be an artist.
[02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:47.420]   But recognize that the techniques are the beginning,
[02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:48.260]   not the end.
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:50.220]   Ultimately, it's the artistry that we are searching for,
[02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:54.100]   not just the science or the by-rote memorization.
[02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:55.460]   And I guess, you know,
[02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:58.260]   you'd hope that people's ability to think critically
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:04:59.940]   and recognize that majority rule,
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:01.760]   or whoever's loudest does not mean that they're right
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:03.020]   by any stretch of the imagination.
[02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:05.700]   And we don't appeal to that, and we don't bow to that.
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:07.460]   We'll help them to,
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:09.580]   help inoculate them against the ridiculous things
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:11.440]   that come out of these places, these dark places,
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:13.780]   that are objectively not great.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:16.300]   But I guess, all circling back,
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:18.380]   if even if we swatted these, you know,
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:21.220]   these bad things out of existence right now,
[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:24.420]   we've got to be very, very careful doing that,
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:26.340]   because it's who's doing the swatting.
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:28.460]   This political group that's in power right now,
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:30.140]   the people that support our current president
[02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:31.340]   would maybe feel a certain way.
[02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:32.700]   The people that support another option
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:35.940]   would feel differently as to what exactly defines toxic.
[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:40.260]   And, you know, I guess that that's what gives me pause.
[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:42.540]   - Yeah, and but also the grace thing.
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:46.860]   I tend to believe that the technology,
[02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:49.620]   you said education, but the platforms we use,
[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:52.900]   like Twitter and the Reddit and all these platforms,
[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:55.340]   have a role to play to teach us grace,
[02:05:55.340 --> 02:06:00.340]   meaning they should help us incentivize
[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:05.500]   the kind of behavior that is incentivized in real life.
[02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:08.580]   Like being a dick in real life is not incentivized.
[02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:10.820]   Like one-on-one interaction.
[02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:12.300]   There's cases where it is,
[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:16.400]   but usually being kind to each other is incentivized.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:17.700]   On the internet, it's not.
[02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:21.140]   Like you get likes for mocking people
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:23.260]   in a funny, in a humorous way.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.940]   And it can be dark kind of mocking,
[02:06:24.940 --> 02:06:25.900]   depending on the community.
[02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:28.540]   You can go to the appearance.
[02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:31.780]   If somebody's a little fat or a little too skinny,
[02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:33.460]   you can comment on their appearance,
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:36.260]   the hair, the way their hair looks,
[02:06:36.260 --> 02:06:37.460]   like the appearance stuff.
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:41.220]   It could be on the people comment all the time,
[02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:45.340]   on the level of eloquence of my speech.
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:46.640]   Go fuck yourself.
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:47.660]   - I like it.
[02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:50.060]   It's creepy though, watching previously,
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:51.440]   like this used to be lowbrow though,
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:52.620]   like people doing this type of stuff.
[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:54.680]   It's creepy watching like our political figures
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:57.040]   get into this type of game.
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:01.080]   - Yes, but again, it's a little bit refreshing, right?
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:04.820]   My hope with Donald Trump was,
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:11.240]   is that he would shake up the people who wear suits usually.
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:13.760]   Like if you're from DC,
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:15.620]   I remember like showing up,
[02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:18.340]   I actually didn't wear what I usually wear in DC
[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:21.780]   'cause I was like, everybody's wearing a suit and tie.
[02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:23.220]   When I was like giving talks and stuff.
[02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:25.340]   - Except for Mudge, who wears jeans and a T-shirt.
[02:07:25.340 --> 02:07:26.740]   - Mudge doesn't give a damn.
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:30.080]   Mudge is a forever renegade.
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:34.620]   But I don't even remember what,
[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:36.220]   oh yeah, so my hope with Trump
[02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:37.900]   was that he would shake up that system,
[02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:42.500]   to say like, to inject new ideas,
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:44.100]   to inject new energy.
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:46.740]   Of course, the way it turned out is different,
[02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:48.340]   but like there's,
[02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:50.260]   it turns out that you might wanna have somebody
[02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:52.620]   who's like an Andrew Yang type character,
[02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:56.020]   who is full of ideas that are very different
[02:07:56.020 --> 02:07:59.540]   and inject the energy, new energy into the system
[02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:04.540]   through youthful new ideas versus through the troll
[02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:08.700]   that like, that's very good at sort of mocking
[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:13.700]   and like playing outside the rules of the game.
[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:16.020]   But Trump did reveal powerfully,
[02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:17.700]   I don't know what to think of it,
[02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:20.820]   that it's just a game
[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:23.120]   and you don't have to play by the rules.
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:25.980]   That's both inspiring and dark.
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:27.540]   - Deeply depressing, right?
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:29.680]   - Yeah, and I don't know what to do with it.
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:31.380]   I don't, I mean the same,
[02:08:31.380 --> 02:08:32.820]   I'm not drawing parallels,
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:35.020]   not drawing parallels between our president
[02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:37.360]   and Adolf Hitler,
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:40.300]   but it's certainly, and there's a lot of,
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:42.540]   in history, a lot of positive
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:44.300]   and a lot of negative things happen
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:46.900]   when charismatic leaders realize
[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:49.260]   they don't have to play by the rules.
[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:50.700]   You can just flip the table.
[02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:55.140]   It's that Kevin Spacey show.
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:55.960]   - Oh, "House of Cards."
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:56.800]   - "House of Cards,"
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:58.540]   where you just flip the table or whatever.
[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:00.500]   You don't have to play by the rules of the chess game.
[02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:01.980]   You can flip the table.
[02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:04.220]   - One wonders if that's always been done in private,
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:06.060]   you know, I guess, 'cause that's,
[02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:07.320]   I mean, even look, obviously,
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:09.200]   the United States is a republic,
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:12.880]   but we had Bush, then we had Clinton,
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:13.780]   then we had more Bush,
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:15.040]   then we had President Obama,
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:17.040]   then we were about to have another Clinton.
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:20.460]   That's fairly creepy, even on its own.
[02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:23.400]   - But now we added another,
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:26.640]   I mean, I'm sure we'll have a generation of Trumps now.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:27.480]   - Gee.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:28.380]   (Lex laughing)
[02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:30.420]   - We, you know, I'm Russian,
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:35.380]   so I think we humans like kings still and queens.
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:37.240]   There's something,
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:41.200]   we're attracted to the thing we talked about, coaches.
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:43.300]   There's something in us that longs
[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:45.740]   towards that authoritarian control.
[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:48.440]   One of the beautiful things about America,
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:50.100]   the Second Amendment,
[02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:53.780]   is we also like individual freedom.
[02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:55.940]   That's one of the unique aspects
[02:09:55.940 --> 02:09:58.340]   at the founding of this country and still,
[02:09:58.340 --> 02:10:01.020]   and for me, is the beacon of hope
[02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:05.940]   that somehow there's the fire of freedom burns,
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:10.660]   and like that Texas feel, that gives me hope.
[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:15.660]   The FU energy that revolts against the power,
[02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:18.020]   which as we discussed, power corrupts
[02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:21.700]   and ultimately leads to sort of degradation
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:26.100]   of whoever's ruling the people.
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:27.020]   - It's interesting, though.
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:28.460]   It seems to me, maybe I'm just,
[02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:30.580]   I don't know if I'm reading this properly when I see it,
[02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:33.540]   but it seems to me that, like you said,
[02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:37.780]   that flip the bird, I'm gonna do me within reason,
[02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:40.060]   as long as I'm not hurting you,
[02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:43.180]   is idea that very much, at least in my mind,
[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:44.700]   defines the American ideal,
[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:47.280]   or at least part of the consciousness of the United States,
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:49.560]   is under attack to a certain extent.
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:54.820]   If only I can think to maybe a generation behind us,
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:59.340]   it's becoming more collectivist.
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:01.700]   For all the good and also the not good of that.
[02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:05.820]   And it's, not in terms of policy at this point,
[02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:08.740]   but just in terms of consciousness.
[02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:11.060]   And I wonder if that's an internet thing.
[02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:12.540]   People are more in touch with one another
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:14.180]   than they've, as far as I can tell,
[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:16.600]   they've ever been, or at least more than in my lifetime.
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:20.860]   And the rest of the world seems much closer than it did.
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:23.620]   Living in Virginia, California, seems very far away.
[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:25.220]   Being on the internet, it's just right there.
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:27.000]   I can hear about it, I can see it.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.860]   I can interact with people from there.
[02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:34.300]   I remember being in Tennessee at one time
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:38.580]   and reading about events taking place in the Middle East.
[02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:40.780]   And that just seemed like a mile away.
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:43.300]   It seemed like an unbelievably far distance.
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:44.740]   And then another time when you're in DC,
[02:11:44.740 --> 02:11:45.940]   you just feel like, oh, you read about something
[02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:47.380]   happening in Paris, and it just feels like
[02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:48.720]   it's just right around the corner.
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:51.220]   Because DC is a seat of power
[02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:52.620]   where things are just occurring all the time.
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:56.880]   And I guess you wonder about,
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:59.840]   that's where I come back to the group decisions
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:03.240]   to not listen to this person, or to cancel this,
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:06.480]   or to, we all, the moral majority shall do the following
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:09.120]   as opposed to, as long as you're not hurting me,
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:11.140]   and as long as you're not hurting anyone else,
[02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:13.240]   I have to let you do, I have to let you be
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:14.160]   on general principle.
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:16.160]   Even if I don't like you, I'm very free to not like you.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:17.360]   I'm free to speak out against you,
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:22.160]   but it is not within my right, and it's not,
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:25.680]   I would not be right to attempt to attack you.
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:27.160]   And that is an interesting thing, though,
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:30.080]   when we see words being redefined, or words being defined,
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:32.200]   whether it's toxicity, whether it's violence.
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:34.400]   If I think that what you're saying is,
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:37.040]   your speech is by itself a violence,
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:39.440]   or a precursor to violence, I'm justified
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:40.960]   in doing all sorts of things.
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:44.960]   You know, and that creeps me out significantly.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:47.080]   Because again, even if it ends up being pointed
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:50.060]   in a good direction initially, it's only a matter of time.
[02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:52.920]   And actually, that brings me to another--
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:53.760]   Dune quote?
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:56.040]   Oh yeah, I got all day.
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:57.160]   How much are they paying you?
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:59.920]   But, well, yeah, about, say, the Frank Herbert estate.
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:01.060]   Not enough, frankly.
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:02.160]   (ZDoggMD laughs)
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:03.140]   Let's see.
[02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:05.340]   And how many books are there in Dune?
[02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:07.340]   That's a Jen question.
[02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:08.800]   You're also a fan of Dune?
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:13.800]   I read the whole series, but not a couple of the,
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:15.240]   I read all the prequels as well,
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:16.700]   with the exception of a couple.
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:18.600]   Is there a book one for Dune?
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:22.040]   Dune would be book one, and even the prequels,
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:24.280]   it's still all better if you start,
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:26.840]   like I read Dune and then read the original,
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:27.680]   what is it, six?
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:29.520]   And then I went back and started to read some other--
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:30.960]   It's like just like watching Star Wars.
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:34.120]   You wanna start at episode four or whatever.
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:35.520]   Yeah, I think so.
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:38.160]   That's the move, and then stop at six,
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:40.640]   call it a day, watch The Mandalorian.
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:42.680]   Well, I thought you're not walking back here.
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:44.080]   No, I like The Mandalorian.
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:44.920]   Yeah, it's not--
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:45.740]   No, it's not The Mandalorian.
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:46.580]   That is what I said.
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:48.220]   I was told that I was heartless
[02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:49.860]   for not liking Baby Yoda, who I--
[02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:52.940]   We don't talk about a couple of the movies,
[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:54.380]   not including The Mandalorian.
[02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:55.620]   The Mandalorian's fine.
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:57.180]   It's the more recent movies
[02:13:57.180 --> 02:13:58.380]   that we don't like to talk about.
[02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:00.860]   Oh, the, what's his name?
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:02.340]   The goofy guy.
[02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:03.180]   Ryan--
[02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:04.460]   No, no.
[02:14:04.460 --> 02:14:06.260]   No, the creature, the goofy creature with the--
[02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:07.100]   Jar Jar?
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:07.920]   Yeah, Jar Jar.
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:10.920]   Do you ever see the Jar Jar Binks is actually
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:12.700]   like the Dark Lord of the Sith theory?
[02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:14.420]   That fixed the whole initial trilogy,
[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:16.140]   where like he's like goofing around
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:17.780]   and like making it all the way through battles,
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:18.620]   and when you're like, wait a minute,
[02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:20.660]   he oopsed his way, walks over to a pool,
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:22.100]   does a triple backflip, falls in,
[02:14:22.100 --> 02:14:24.780]   you're like, it's just bizarre that you--
[02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:27.740]   This is the Alex Jones theory of Star Wars.
[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:29.580]   It's like he's actually running everything.
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:30.940]   He was the one that actually was like,
[02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:33.860]   hey, we should vote in Chancellor Palpatine,
[02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:35.900]   or Senator Palpatine, like right before.
[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:37.140]   They put Jar Jar in charge.
[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:38.780]   First off, what did they think was gonna happen?
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:41.540]   And second off, I just think that'd be great.
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:44.180]   You're like, oops, oh man, I guess he's the emperor now.
[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:45.020]   That would have been great.
[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:47.620]   But actually, to the cancel and all the other stuff,
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:50.140]   again, it's just, you'd hope that it gives pause.
[02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:51.100]   And I think about this for fighting,
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:53.100]   because a lot of times, I'll use this example.
[02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:56.420]   People like fight fans and like UFC,
[02:14:56.420 --> 02:14:58.780]   they love people that run out and try to murder each other.
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:01.600]   And it's entertaining, and it's super entertaining,
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:05.340]   but Floyd Mayweather doesn't resonate with people as much.
[02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:06.220]   It's like people started,
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:07.980]   I remember the time when Floyd was not as popular.
[02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:09.420]   Now people think people love Floyd
[02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:11.500]   because he's 50 and 0 Floyd.
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:13.420]   And oh man, and finally he had so much success
[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:15.060]   that we all can't help but recognize
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:16.780]   the man's genius and greatness.
[02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:19.460]   But prior to that, oh, he's boring, he's this, he's that.
[02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:24.020]   He fights, he's circumspect, he's cautious, he's pressing.
[02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:26.720]   He's intelligent, deeply intelligent.
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:28.940]   And when you watch people go out
[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:29.780]   and try to murder each other,
[02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:31.480]   you can flip a coin 100 times,
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:34.300]   and you could be lucky enough to get 100 heads,
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:35.820]   but it's still a coin flip.
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:38.580]   And I think that that's what's going on all the time
[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:40.820]   is people are getting an outcome that they want,
[02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:42.740]   but it wasn't a well thought out situation.
[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:45.220]   So that's why you'll win by five in a row by knockout
[02:15:45.220 --> 02:15:46.580]   and then lose three in a row.
[02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:48.240]   And then people will go, well, what happened to that guy?
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:49.220]   He used to be so great.
[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:51.180]   And you're like, no, he's doing what he's always been doing.
[02:15:51.180 --> 02:15:52.840]   It's just, it was getting great outcomes
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:54.100]   on a coin flip prior,
[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:56.700]   and it's getting negative outcomes on a coin flip now.
[02:15:56.700 --> 02:15:59.460]   But I guess what I would say is it watches,
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:02.820]   it's interesting watching, I guess,
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:06.020]   societal beliefs become such a thing
[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:07.940]   that we're almost adopting on a religious level
[02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:08.940]   if we're not careful.
[02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:12.220]   If when I say religious level, I mean like pan life,
[02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:14.340]   like this is guiding all of my choices
[02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:15.340]   for all the good and the bad of that.
[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:16.420]   And this is a Dune quote,
[02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:18.660]   is when religion and politics travel in the same car,
[02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:21.240]   the writers believe that nothing can stand in their way.
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:22.580]   Their movements become headlong
[02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:24.500]   faster and faster and faster.
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:26.340]   They put aside all thoughts of obstacles
[02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:28.400]   and forget that the precipice does not show itself
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:31.300]   to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:33.660]   And I think that that's, again, the pause.
[02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:34.820]   We go, oh man, thank goodness.
[02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:36.500]   We have this guy that wants to rebuild Germany.
[02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:38.740]   He'll put us back where we need to be.
[02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:41.820]   - And you stop questioning your own judgment,
[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:45.260]   your own, you stop thinking essentially.
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:46.780]   - Right, I'm not allowed to question this.
[02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:48.060]   Oh, well, of course this is correct.
[02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:49.480]   Of course, I'm right.
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:50.620]   I intended to do right.
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:52.300]   So of course my actions are correct.
[02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:53.620]   I mean, how many times have any of us
[02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:55.100]   intended to do something helpful
[02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:57.220]   and ended up doing something less?
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:16:59.580]   And plenty of people who intend to do harm
[02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:01.860]   could by accident do something decent.
[02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:06.860]   And I guess it's, I'm not saying anything terribly insightful
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:09.820]   but it's just one of those where it's hard to say
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:12.860]   in the moment and that's where you hopefully caution,
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:14.820]   you would counsel some degree of caution.
[02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:19.060]   And that's what worries me with people deciding
[02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:20.580]   that we're all so right about this
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:21.900]   or we're all so right about that
[02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:25.260]   and attempting to, rather than win the argument,
[02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:26.740]   silence the counter-argument
[02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:28.740]   no matter how crazy it may seem.
[02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:30.040]   Because I just think that that idea,
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:31.920]   even when it's pointed in a good direction initially,
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:33.260]   it's only a matter of time.
[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:39.040]   - You're amongst many things a Jiu-Jitsu black belt.
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:43.320]   One of the things that people are really curious about,
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:45.080]   white belts and blue belts in Jiu-Jitsu
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:47.320]   but also people who haven't tried the art
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:51.280]   is what does it take to be a Jiu-Jitsu black belt?
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:53.880]   - I think that everyone's journey is a little bit different
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:57.240]   but the one thing that the, what is it,
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:00.600]   Calvin Coolidge quote, "Determination, persistence
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:03.640]   is the only thing that will win in the end."
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:05.160]   It will always win in the end.
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:08.720]   Not brilliance, not toughness, not education.
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:10.320]   It's persistence.
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:12.440]   And I think that having the belief
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:15.640]   that no matter what happens to me, I will proceed forward
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:17.680]   and I will figure out how to make this happen,
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:18.840]   hell or high water,
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:20.680]   I think is the one thing that ties together
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:22.240]   all of the people that I've ever met
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:24.780]   that made it through whatever it was
[02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:25.980]   that they were going through.
[02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:28.960]   Because sometimes you can get lucky
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:30.520]   and you can have an easy time
[02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:32.880]   or and that luck could be you had a good situation.
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:34.740]   It could be, I mean, like in the obvious sense
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:36.120]   of like where you're living, where you're training,
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:37.440]   what's going on, you had a good situation,
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:39.800]   you're unbelievably athletic.
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:41.400]   Oh, you're gonna be an astronaut,
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:43.280]   you're brilliant and an Olympic athlete,
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:45.360]   you know, like, oh, well, that's a fantastic situation.
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:46.760]   You know, you won the genetic lottery
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:47.940]   and I'm sure you've worked hard as well,
[02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:49.880]   but you also won the genetic lottery.
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:52.800]   It's a determination is the one thing though,
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:55.560]   because that person could have a very easy go of it
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:57.380]   initially and then tear their knee.
[02:18:57.380 --> 02:19:00.080]   And then they're no longer the superhuman
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.860]   physical specimen that they were.
[02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:04.600]   The only thing that will keep them going is persistence.
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:08.760]   And I think that that, I would just say that persistence,
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:10.680]   I say, I'll just put one foot in front of the other.
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:13.040]   And sometimes I can see the path ahead.
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:16.160]   And sometimes it's beyond my vision, but I will not stop.
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:18.480]   I may even slow down, but I won't stop.
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:20.640]   And that's the only thing that I can say
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:22.240]   that I've seen tie everyone together
[02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:24.560]   because there's so many ways to the top of any mountain
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:26.380]   and there's so many different personalities
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:28.880]   and skills and backgrounds involved,
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:31.680]   but everyone carries on.
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:34.200]   - So at the core, the foundational advice
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:36.320]   is just don't quit, just keep going.
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:38.400]   - That's the lesson of martial arts, I think.
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:42.280]   We think it's like how to be strong or how to win,
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:44.480]   but in reality, it's like how to persist, how to endure,
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:47.760]   because all of us have been beaten so many times
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:49.120]   and gotten beaten up so many times
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:49.960]   and thought about quitting.
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:51.040]   Have I ever thought about quitting?
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:51.880]   Absolutely.
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:52.700]   Have I ever quit?
[02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:53.540]   Never.
[02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:55.320]   I will never, ever quit, ever.
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:56.160]   I can say it.
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:56.980]   You might knock me out.
[02:19:56.980 --> 02:19:58.040]   I will be damned if I quit.
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:19:59.240]   - What's the darkest moment?
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:00.480]   Is it injury related?
[02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:02.360]   (Isaac sighs)
[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:03.480]   Is it?
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:06.040]   - So to me, two possibilities.
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:08.840]   I've fortunately never been seriously injured,
[02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:11.920]   but I think that's a dark place to be,
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:16.060]   having to be out for many months for,
[02:20:16.060 --> 02:20:19.680]   as Jen was saying, with a head injury especially,
[02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:23.000]   the uncertainty, that's one.
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:27.300]   And then the other side is if you have big ambitions
[02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:31.740]   as a competitor, realizing that you're not as good,
[02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:36.900]   like those doubts where like, I kind of suck.
[02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:39.100]   How am I supposed to be a world,
[02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:40.860]   the greatest fighter of all time
[02:20:40.860 --> 02:20:46.180]   if like several people in the gym are kicking my ass?
[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:48.780]   Those are the two things that paralyze you.
[02:20:48.780 --> 02:20:53.780]   - I think that everyone's darkest moment is maybe different.
[02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:55.820]   Looking from the outside for Ryan,
[02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:57.700]   I wouldn't say that he's had injuries
[02:20:57.700 --> 02:20:58.540]   and he's had bad ones.
[02:20:58.540 --> 02:21:00.780]   I wouldn't say that was his darkest moment.
[02:21:00.780 --> 02:21:04.260]   I think for me, I would say my head injury
[02:21:04.260 --> 02:21:06.260]   was my darkest moment.
[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:08.580]   Absolutely, and I have torn my ACL twice.
[02:21:08.580 --> 02:21:09.980]   I've torn my shoulders four times.
[02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:12.020]   I've had lots of surgeries.
[02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:15.060]   For me, the orthopedic injuries
[02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:17.660]   were not the most difficult.
[02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:19.020]   It was the brain injury.
[02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:21.140]   For others, that might be the case for them.
[02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:24.060]   Maybe they've never experienced an injury,
[02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:26.340]   and maybe for them, that's their darkest moment.
[02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:29.500]   From the outside, obviously, Ryan can speak to this more,
[02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:32.940]   but for Ryan, I think it was the inability
[02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:35.460]   to perform at certain points,
[02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:38.740]   the missing of opportunities that for him,
[02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:40.500]   from my perspective, watching him go through
[02:21:40.500 --> 02:21:43.060]   and having seen various points of his growth
[02:21:43.060 --> 02:21:45.380]   from early PurpleBot on,
[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:48.260]   I think the hardest time for him looking in, obviously,
[02:21:48.260 --> 02:21:51.340]   was when he would hit moments
[02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:54.380]   where he wasn't able to perform for various reasons.
[02:21:54.380 --> 02:21:55.300]   He couldn't get fights.
[02:21:55.300 --> 02:21:57.100]   He was having difficulties there.
[02:21:57.100 --> 02:22:00.100]   I think that was the hardest points for him.
[02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:02.300]   - Did you think, with a head injury,
[02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:05.340]   that you might never be able to do jujitsu again?
[02:22:05.340 --> 02:22:09.220]   - Yeah, I mean, mine was really bad,
[02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:10.420]   and it was just the one hit,
[02:22:10.420 --> 02:22:13.120]   but I had a looping memory for seven months.
[02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:14.980]   Didn't know it, because when your brain's messed up,
[02:22:14.980 --> 02:22:17.060]   you're not even aware that you're looping.
[02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:17.900]   - That's great.
[02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:21.820]   - And so, I saw two different neurologists.
[02:22:21.820 --> 02:22:24.380]   I finally, it took a very long time.
[02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:26.160]   I didn't know if I was gonna be able
[02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:28.580]   to have linear thoughts or read a book.
[02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:29.940]   I didn't know, at certain points,
[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:32.060]   if I could listen to music again,
[02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:34.340]   without it making my head hurt.
[02:22:34.340 --> 02:22:37.280]   And so, it was almost two years
[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:39.780]   before I woke up in the morning without a headache,
[02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:42.940]   just waking up before I even start my day.
[02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:43.780]   And so that--
[02:22:43.780 --> 02:22:45.180]   - So that's even bigger than jujitsu.
[02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:46.020]   That's just life.
[02:22:46.020 --> 02:22:47.820]   - That's just hard.
[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:51.300]   And I think that you can experience so many things.
[02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:53.580]   I've had all these injuries.
[02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:57.180]   We lost a baby when I was 15 weeks.
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:22:58.920]   And we've had all these experiences.
[02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:01.880]   And what the hardest point for me,
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:03.760]   not saying all those things weren't hard,
[02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:05.080]   but it's kind of like,
[02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:07.680]   when you go through these, you just realize life goes on,
[02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:09.200]   and you have to keep working at it,
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:10.120]   and you have to keep going.
[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:13.640]   And you asked me earlier offline, did I feel depressed?
[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:16.600]   Not from my head injury.
[02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:18.960]   I don't think that, at least in the moment,
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:21.000]   I had any recognition of that.
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.560]   It's kind of like,
[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:24.180]   but I think different people's personalities,
[02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:28.120]   I have kind of the like, buckle down and just keep going.
[02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:31.300]   And sometimes it's not until lots of time later
[02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:33.700]   that you realize, wow, that was really hard.
[02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:36.260]   'Cause you're just struggling to live and function
[02:23:36.260 --> 02:23:37.960]   and do the things that you need to do along the way.
[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:41.180]   - Do you mind jumping on just like this part
[02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:42.020]   of the conversation just for a few minutes?
[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:43.540]   - I'm sorry, I need to over.
[02:23:43.540 --> 02:23:45.720]   - Do you mind, no, just sitting together?
[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:47.060]   - Oh, no, no.
[02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:47.900]   - Just for a little bit.
[02:23:47.900 --> 02:23:48.740]   - Sorry about that, I didn't mean to jump in there.
[02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:50.840]   - It'd be cool if we put a face to it.
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:51.920]   - No, no, no.
[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:54.000]   Is it okay with you?
[02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.320]   - Yeah, it's fine with me, it's fine with you.
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:58.240]   - By the way, what was the head injury,
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:23:59.560]   if you don't mind sharing?
[02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:00.940]   - Someone had dropped their knee
[02:24:00.940 --> 02:24:02.520]   on the back of my head during training.
[02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:04.280]   It was a lot bigger than me.
[02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:09.280]   So one strike to the back of the head is too much for,
[02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:11.520]   there's a reason that's outlawed in MMA, right?
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:13.360]   Someone 50 pounds heavier than you drops their knee
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:15.560]   on the back of your head once and it's.
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:16.960]   - That's the funny thing about getting hit, right?
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:19.660]   You never can really be sure what's gonna happen.
[02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:21.080]   I think that's actually one of the magical parts
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:23.080]   about Jiu-Jitsu, where if you choke me,
[02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:26.120]   we know what's gonna occur.
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:29.240]   You hit someone, they might be completely unharmed.
[02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:31.080]   You might be punching Tony Ferguson in the face
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:33.200]   and you need to hit him with a sledgehammer
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:34.440]   to affect this man.
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:36.840]   And then other people, they could get really badly hurt,
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:39.440]   which I guess, back to your point about street fighting
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:42.440]   and things like that and the serious, serious potential,
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:45.520]   second, third order consequences of any action that we take.
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:48.160]   But yeah, that's a tricky thing about getting hit.
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:50.140]   - How does it make you feel that,
[02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:54.220]   like the really shitty thing about injuries to me
[02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:56.780]   was that like, you start thinking like,
[02:24:56.780 --> 02:24:59.500]   well, if I did this one little thing different,
[02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:01.820]   like this wouldn't have happened today.
[02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:05.340]   Like one moment changes your entire life.
[02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:08.020]   Is that, do you think that way
[02:25:08.020 --> 02:25:10.780]   or is that totally counterproductive?
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:12.380]   - You can't help but think that way
[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:14.500]   when you've had the amount of injuries I've had now,
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:17.440]   'cause I've had more than most people's fair share.
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:20.940]   As my orthopedic says, you don't wanna win that.
[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:23.380]   You don't wanna win the contest of who's had the most.
[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:25.380]   - But since you have, thanks for building me a pool.
[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:29.820]   - Yeah, but I think you can't help but think that way
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:32.320]   sometimes, but I definitely don't think it's,
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:33.700]   I think it can be facilitative
[02:25:33.700 --> 02:25:36.040]   if you don't beat yourself up too much.
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:40.420]   Because thinking about why have I been subject
[02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:44.060]   to so many injuries and a lot of it comes to just
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:46.980]   almost all of mine in particular,
[02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:49.020]   people a lot heavier than me.
[02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:50.940]   But if I've been training martial arts 15 years,
[02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:53.380]   I'm obviously on the much smaller side, I'm a woman.
[02:25:53.380 --> 02:25:56.620]   I've done thousands and thousands of rounds
[02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:58.940]   with people 50 pounds plus heavier than me.
[02:25:58.940 --> 02:26:01.700]   I mean, years not training with anyone less than 50 pounds,
[02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:03.980]   which is 50 pounds is almost half my body weight.
[02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:05.540]   And when you also add testosterone
[02:26:05.540 --> 02:26:08.820]   and the natural physiological advantages of men,
[02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:10.740]   not just are they heavier with more mass,
[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:11.980]   they're faster and more explosive,
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:14.800]   they're stronger if they're the same size.
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:19.800]   And so I think that the willingness to be in that environment
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:22.780]   over and over and over again creates a lot of strength,
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:24.860]   resiliency, willingness to continue.
[02:26:24.860 --> 02:26:29.740]   But it also, in order to do that, you almost have to,
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:33.020]   for me, the way I was approaching it was like,
[02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:36.580]   pretend like I wasn't more vulnerable
[02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:39.260]   and just be willing to step in and step in and step in.
[02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:40.100]   - Take it until you make it kind of thing?
[02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:42.140]   - Take it until you make it kind of, yeah,
[02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:44.780]   like I'll just one day I'll be strong enough.
[02:26:44.780 --> 02:26:47.620]   - And you avoided injury for most of it.
[02:26:47.620 --> 02:26:49.280]   - For most of those rounds I would injury.
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:50.640]   The problem, as Ryan points out,
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:52.360]   is that you could do thousands of rounds,
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:54.800]   but if one person that size, that strength,
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:57.760]   that hover reacts in a way that you don't expect,
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:00.880]   it's not like an oops, it's like always major.
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:02.700]   - Do you regret any of it?
[02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:05.480]   - I think that most, no one I know has experienced
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:07.840]   the degree of injuries that I've experienced.
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:09.700]   And I started just at a time when,
[02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:12.480]   in 2005 it was very different than now,
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:14.900]   where you have, the coaches have more control
[02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:15.940]   over what you're doing.
[02:27:15.940 --> 02:27:19.340]   They're more aware in general about a lot of the injuries.
[02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:24.340]   There's a lot more people who are hobbyists
[02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:26.380]   than when I started.
[02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:28.620]   They were hobbyists, but it was different kind of hobbyist,
[02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:29.640]   you know, than now.
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:33.700]   Now our girls can train with other girls.
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:35.540]   They don't have to do thousands of rounds
[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:38.380]   with somebody significantly more powerful than them.
[02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:43.540]   And for the drawbacks and the benefits of that,
[02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:44.900]   you know, as with anything.
[02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:50.980]   So I think that I don't think I would go back and change it.
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:53.140]   There were times after one of my injuries
[02:27:53.140 --> 02:27:56.460]   where I said to Ryan, I said, "I quit, I'm done.
[02:27:56.460 --> 02:27:57.300]   "I'm not doing this anymore."
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:27:58.180]   I probably said it more than once,
[02:27:58.180 --> 02:28:01.220]   but there was one time I was really serious in 2012.
[02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:03.520]   I was really serious.
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:04.580]   I tore my shoulder.
[02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:07.260]   I was looking at missing a big competition again
[02:28:07.260 --> 02:28:09.620]   in the world for my second or third year in a row
[02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:10.460]   after injuries.
[02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:12.980]   And I said, I'd quit my job two years before.
[02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:15.500]   And I'm like, I'm done.
[02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:18.900]   And Ryan, before that had always been, you know,
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:19.740]   keep me focused.
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:21.580]   And then he kind of said, "Okay, if you want to be done,
[02:28:21.580 --> 02:28:24.060]   "be done, just have a good time."
[02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:25.580]   And I'm like, "No, I'm really done.
[02:28:25.580 --> 02:28:26.620]   "I don't even want to train anymore."
[02:28:26.620 --> 02:28:27.940]   He's like, "Okay, okay."
[02:28:27.940 --> 02:28:31.700]   And then, you know, I think he helped facilitate a moment
[02:28:31.700 --> 02:28:35.100]   for me to go visit a friend, some friends,
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:37.260]   some girls that were doing a girls camp
[02:28:37.260 --> 02:28:38.340]   who are close to my size,
[02:28:38.340 --> 02:28:39.660]   who are some friends of mine to go train.
[02:28:39.660 --> 02:28:42.200]   And I was like, "Oh, wait, I do love this thing.
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:44.180]   "It's just harder for me on a daily basis,
[02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:46.080]   "but that doesn't mean I don't love this thing."
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:47.860]   And it really helped change my mind.
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:49.300]   I started to connect with some other people,
[02:28:49.300 --> 02:28:52.980]   travel more myself, 'cause previously he had done that,
[02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:54.920]   but I hadn't really done that.
[02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:57.220]   I think there was a point where,
[02:28:57.220 --> 02:28:59.060]   when I started Jiu-Jitsu, it was just for fun.
[02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:00.620]   I just wanted to sport after college.
[02:29:00.620 --> 02:29:01.740]   I played sports as a kid.
[02:29:01.740 --> 02:29:03.340]   I just wanted to exercise.
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:04.700]   I wasn't into the martial arts.
[02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:05.740]   He used to give me a hard time about it
[02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:06.680]   'cause he was always very,
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:08.140]   "How can you not care about martial arts?"
[02:29:08.140 --> 02:29:10.180]   I don't know, I just want to play sports.
[02:29:10.180 --> 02:29:14.060]   And Ryan was really big into kind of the philosophy side
[02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:16.100]   of the martial arts aspect.
[02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:17.140]   He used to give me a hard time.
[02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:18.580]   And I think after that moment,
[02:29:18.580 --> 02:29:20.160]   this moment where I looked at myself and I said,
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:21.660]   "Do I want to keep doing this?"
[02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:24.300]   Is when I started to appreciate Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:26.240]   It took off some of the pressure I'd been feeling,
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:28.260]   I think, as Ryan's girlfriend,
[02:29:28.260 --> 02:29:30.080]   but I had a full-time job a long time.
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:33.500]   It was never my goal to be a Jiu-Jitsu world champion.
[02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:36.180]   And I think after that moment where I was like,
[02:29:36.180 --> 02:29:37.540]   "You know, I really do like this.
[02:29:37.540 --> 02:29:38.700]   "I really do want to keep this."
[02:29:38.700 --> 02:29:40.660]   I had this moment, like any time where you're like,
[02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:41.500]   "I'm doing this for me.
[02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:42.940]   "I'm not doing this for him."
[02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:47.940]   And I think that that was really lucky for me
[02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:51.340]   because how often in our lives do we have a kind of
[02:29:51.340 --> 02:29:54.040]   a challenge where we have to stop and we have to say,
[02:29:54.040 --> 02:29:55.580]   "Is this really what I want?"
[02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:57.340]   How often in a relationship do you do that?
[02:29:57.340 --> 02:30:01.260]   How often in any type of lifestyle or job do you stop
[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:02.300]   and do you really ask yourself,
[02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:04.900]   does something really difficult happen that you look
[02:30:04.900 --> 02:30:06.620]   and you go, "Am I just doing this
[02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:08.120]   "because it's convenient and easy
[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:09.900]   "or is this what I really want to do?"
[02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:11.660]   - Yeah, I've had those moments.
[02:30:11.660 --> 02:30:14.580]   Like this podcast is one of those things.
[02:30:14.580 --> 02:30:19.120]   It's like you stop and think like,
[02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:20.740]   "I actually love this."
[02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:23.780]   And I had that with Jiu-Jitsu too.
[02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:28.580]   I don't think I had sat until like Brown Belt that I stopped.
[02:30:28.580 --> 02:30:31.780]   I mean, yeah, it's when you first face real challenges,
[02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:34.900]   you think like, "Why am I doing this?"
[02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:38.740]   I think most of my progression was, "Why not?"
[02:30:38.740 --> 02:30:40.820]   I think that's the leap of faith.
[02:30:40.820 --> 02:30:42.980]   And then at a certain point you think like,
[02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:45.220]   "Why am I doing this?"
[02:30:45.220 --> 02:30:49.420]   And if you can answer honestly that because I love it,
[02:30:49.420 --> 02:30:51.180]   it's kind of a liberating feeling.
[02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:54.700]   Yeah, it's so powerful.
[02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:55.620]   It's an acceptance. - Well, you feel thankful
[02:30:55.620 --> 02:30:57.700]   for the opportunity to be there, right?
[02:30:57.700 --> 02:30:59.180]   Because you love it and you go, "Man, I..."
[02:30:59.180 --> 02:31:00.740]   - Yeah, it's great gratitude.
[02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:02.900]   - Yeah, it's ultimately gratitude.
[02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:04.540]   Yeah, let me ask you this.
[02:31:04.540 --> 02:31:06.780]   So Ryan said like, what is it?
[02:31:06.780 --> 02:31:07.620]   - I took over your thing.
[02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:10.740]   - Yeah, no, nobody cares about Ryan.
[02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:11.580]   - I wouldn't.
[02:31:11.580 --> 02:31:13.380]   - Yeah, I'll Photoshop him out or whatever.
[02:31:13.380 --> 02:31:14.220]   However you had to do that.
[02:31:14.220 --> 02:31:15.060]   - If you do that, it'd be great.
[02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:16.420]   Just put Sean Connery's head.
[02:31:16.420 --> 02:31:19.740]   - Just like a Dune ad over here.
[02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:20.580]   - Exactly.
[02:31:20.580 --> 02:31:21.420]   (laughing)
[02:31:21.420 --> 02:31:23.660]   - Sean Connery, I can get down that.
[02:31:23.660 --> 02:31:26.260]   - Is that the sexiest man in Sean Connery?
[02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:28.940]   - In the Dune universe, that's my understanding.
[02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:30.660]   - I think in any universe.
[02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:32.460]   - Yeah, well, my gosh, I didn't give him.
[02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:34.940]   - We actually named our son after Sean Connery.
[02:31:34.940 --> 02:31:35.780]   - Oh yeah.
[02:31:35.780 --> 02:31:36.620]   - That's right.
[02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:37.440]   - We did.
[02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:38.280]   - Three, five nos and a yesh, yesh, yesh.
[02:31:38.280 --> 02:31:39.420]   (laughing)
[02:31:39.420 --> 02:31:40.620]   - He was in "The Rock."
[02:31:40.620 --> 02:31:42.900]   I love all those lame,
[02:31:42.900 --> 02:31:43.900]   - Nicolas Cage.
[02:31:43.900 --> 02:31:44.740]   Oh yeah.
[02:31:44.740 --> 02:31:46.860]   - Conair's probably the greatest movie of all time.
[02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:49.300]   - Dude, his accent in Conair was so awesome.
[02:31:49.300 --> 02:31:50.220]   - I don't know where it's from.
[02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:51.740]   Alabama, I guess, or something.
[02:31:51.740 --> 02:31:53.420]   - I love that they got like Steve Buscemi in there.
[02:31:53.420 --> 02:31:54.940]   They're like, "We need Steve Buscemi in this thing."
[02:31:54.940 --> 02:31:55.780]   And we got him.
[02:31:55.780 --> 02:31:56.820]   - Dave Chappelle?
[02:31:56.820 --> 02:31:57.660]   - Yeah, that's right.
[02:31:57.660 --> 02:31:58.980]   - He's a prisoner in there.
[02:31:58.980 --> 02:31:59.820]   - "8 Ball."
[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:00.660]   - That's right.
[02:32:00.660 --> 02:32:02.700]   - Yep, greatest movie of all time.
[02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:03.540]   Should have won an Oscar.
[02:32:03.540 --> 02:32:06.900]   - Dave Chappelle also in "Blue Street" with Martin Lawrence.
[02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:09.180]   And in, what do you call it, "Robin Hood Men in Tights."
[02:32:09.180 --> 02:32:10.020]   - Oh, "Robin Hood Men in Tights"
[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:11.460]   was one of my favorites as a kid.
[02:32:11.460 --> 02:32:14.640]   - I've baked, but yeah, that's a good.
[02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:19.900]   Wow, we just listed off some really bad '90s movies, but.
[02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:20.940]   - You take that back.
[02:32:20.940 --> 02:32:22.180]   - For telling our age.
[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:23.380]   - Yeah, it's all right.
[02:32:23.380 --> 02:32:24.900]   Speak for yourself.
[02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:27.440]   - So what, like, in your view,
[02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:30.620]   I don't mean to, from a smaller person, I guess,
[02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:34.980]   that's an interesting thing about jujitsu is that small,
[02:32:34.980 --> 02:32:38.620]   I don't, hopefully it's not a bad thing.
[02:32:38.620 --> 02:32:39.460]   - Elf.
[02:32:39.460 --> 02:32:40.300]   (laughing)
[02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:41.780]   Elves are taller.
[02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:46.140]   - Like, with all these bigger people,
[02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:48.060]   you can still enjoy the art.
[02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:50.180]   Like, what does it take to get a black belt,
[02:32:50.180 --> 02:32:54.220]   to excel, to quote-unquote master the art?
[02:32:54.220 --> 02:32:55.940]   - Gosh, everyone has such a different path.
[02:32:55.940 --> 02:32:59.160]   Brian's promoted six, seven people.
[02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:00.000]   - Something like that.
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.580]   - And I think about half of them have had,
[02:33:02.580 --> 02:33:08.180]   have kids, have families, have other careers.
[02:33:08.180 --> 02:33:10.480]   At the time, some of them competed a lot,
[02:33:10.480 --> 02:33:13.480]   some of them have never competed or rarely competed.
[02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:15.720]   Some haven't competed in a long time.
[02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:17.680]   Some had started different places.
[02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:19.680]   Everyone's had different journeys,
[02:33:19.680 --> 02:33:22.720]   even in our own little group of seven.
[02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:25.540]   I think only, maybe only two or three
[02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:29.500]   were high-level competitors of that group
[02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:30.700]   at the higher belts, right?
[02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:33.580]   Like brown, black, maybe.
[02:33:33.580 --> 02:33:36.420]   And so, it's just different for every person.
[02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:38.400]   And that's something that we try to tell our,
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:40.220]   since we have 400 students,
[02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:43.660]   and do we have, we don't really have anyone
[02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:48.460]   who's a stated, other than like the coaches, like Adam,
[02:33:48.460 --> 02:33:50.100]   but we don't have anyone that's like a stated
[02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:52.300]   high-level competitor as a student at the moment.
[02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:53.500]   People look at our gym and go,
[02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:54.340]   "Oh, it's lots of competitors."
[02:33:54.340 --> 02:33:55.340]   It's not lots of competitors.
[02:33:55.340 --> 02:33:57.920]   It's never been lots of competitors.
[02:33:57.920 --> 02:34:00.840]   And we've had ones and twos here and there.
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:03.780]   But really, everybody's in it for the long-term
[02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:04.620]   if they're in it.
[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:06.220]   Sometimes the high-level competitors
[02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:07.760]   are the ones that are more likely to drop off
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:09.640]   because they have a bit of success,
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:11.480]   particularly at blue or purple,
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:13.820]   and then they realize how hard it is at brown and black,
[02:34:13.820 --> 02:34:17.240]   and then they have a hard time continuing on that path.
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:19.440]   And then they can't look at themselves as a non-competitor.
[02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:22.060]   They have a hard time continuing with jujitsu, I think.
[02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:24.080]   Whereas sometimes it's the guy who comes in
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:27.460]   as a white belt and he trains twice a week, every week,
[02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:28.440]   and the next thing you know,
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:29.940]   he's been there for two or three years.
[02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:30.860]   Like, "Oh, he's a blue belt.
[02:34:30.860 --> 02:34:31.700]   He's a purple belt.
[02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:32.580]   He's a brown belt."
[02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:36.240]   And he's just consistent over a long period of time
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:38.080]   and willing to take the path.
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:40.480]   And no two people's path is exactly the same.
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:42.680]   No two people's lives are exactly the same.
[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:45.940]   We have students who started as a white belt,
[02:34:45.940 --> 02:34:50.460]   as a young adult with no responsibilities,
[02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:51.460]   and they train all the time.
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:53.580]   And then they have a job,
[02:34:53.580 --> 02:34:54.620]   then they graduate college,
[02:34:54.620 --> 02:34:55.460]   then they have a job,
[02:34:55.460 --> 02:34:56.280]   then they have married,
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:34:57.120]   then they have kids,
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:58.140]   then they have different points in their careers.
[02:34:58.140 --> 02:34:59.740]   And at different points in your life,
[02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:03.620]   jujitsu will be there for whatever way
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:05.180]   that you're willing to accept it.
[02:35:05.180 --> 02:35:06.940]   It's place, I think.
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:08.100]   Well, that's actually kind of what,
[02:35:08.100 --> 02:35:10.580]   back to the initial question we discussed about
[02:35:10.580 --> 02:35:11.760]   what makes a warrior.
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:15.380]   And also what makes something or someone
[02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:16.940]   particularly impressive in my mind
[02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:19.900]   is what they make out of what they have.
[02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:23.020]   One of my favorite movies ever is Forrest Gump.
[02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:25.060]   And it's obviously, it's just,
[02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:26.780]   if you can't, 'cause I've heard people,
[02:35:26.780 --> 02:35:27.700]   like, "Oh, Forrest Gump sucks."
[02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:29.140]   I'm like, "I don't like you as a person."
[02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:32.380]   And like, you have no heart at all.
[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:35.460]   But basically, it's the story of someone that tries hard.
[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:37.860]   And it's like, yeah, but it's a funny movie.
[02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:42.860]   But it's like, I guess you meet each person where they are.
[02:35:42.860 --> 02:35:46.060]   And obviously, you want, everyone needs to be pushed.
[02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:47.060]   We all need to be pushed.
[02:35:47.060 --> 02:35:48.680]   We need friends and people around us
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:51.440]   that push us to be better versions of ourselves
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:52.280]   all the time.
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:53.100]   And as you mentioned,
[02:35:53.100 --> 02:35:54.740]   the people you spend all of your time around
[02:35:54.740 --> 02:35:56.140]   deeply impact you.
[02:35:56.140 --> 02:35:58.740]   And we have to be willing to be pushed.
[02:35:58.740 --> 02:36:00.500]   It takes a leap of faith for me to trust,
[02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:04.780]   for me to put some of myself in my,
[02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:07.540]   I guess, my ability, my control, my personal agency,
[02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:09.540]   as it were, in the hands of someone else
[02:36:09.540 --> 02:36:12.200]   that I trust and that I respect.
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:15.200]   But if I can do that, again,
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:18.840]   maybe I never become high-level black belt competitor.
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:21.280]   But I had four of the things I was doing in my life.
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:22.220]   I also have a family.
[02:36:22.220 --> 02:36:23.380]   I have this, I have that.
[02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:24.900]   What that person was able to accomplish
[02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:25.740]   in the martial arts
[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:28.320]   relative to what they were able to put in this phenomenal.
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:30.860]   Other times, someone could be a very successful black belt
[02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:32.180]   and in my mind, be a bum
[02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:33.680]   because they could have been a lot more.
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:35.620]   And they could have done more.
[02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:37.100]   They could have focused more.
[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:39.340]   And there's no shame in deciding
[02:36:39.340 --> 02:36:40.420]   that you don't wanna do that.
[02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:42.820]   But whatever it is that you're invested in,
[02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:45.700]   I remember the "Take It Uneasy" podcast.
[02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:49.720]   And that I loved because I'll just chill out.
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:50.560]   I like resting.
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:51.380]   It's like vacation.
[02:36:51.380 --> 02:36:52.220]   Oh, who wants to go on vacation?
[02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:53.360]   Yeah, I'll go on vacation for a day or two.
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:54.560]   You wanna spend three weeks on vacation?
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:55.400]   Like, I kill myself.
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:56.220]   Like, get me out of here.
[02:36:56.220 --> 02:36:57.060]   Like, this is horrible.
[02:36:57.060 --> 02:36:58.400]   This is, I'm a waste of life.
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:36:59.680]   I'm not doing anything useful.
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:01.520]   - You're technically on vacation right now.
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:02.360]   - Right, well, this is fun though.
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:04.160]   - This is like a one-day vacation.
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:06.360]   - Exactly, but if you had,
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:08.080]   I'm sure you're thinking about jumping off
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:09.000]   of the building right now.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.080]   But if you had to talk to me for like three days,
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:13.760]   I'm sure you'd probably shove me off the building.
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:14.600]   I don't blame you.
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:15.440]   - I would be dead.
[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:16.260]   - People, yeah.
[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:17.100]   - Five hours in.
[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:17.940]   - But yeah, but you know,
[02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:20.560]   it's like you wanna be pushing towards something.
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:22.640]   'Cause otherwise, what's the purpose of being here?
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:24.160]   You know, it's not just a college.
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:26.360]   It's doing something useful,
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:27.740]   building, growing as a person,
[02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:28.840]   helping others do the same,
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:31.360]   if that's within your power at any given time.
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:32.800]   But I think that's kind of the neat thing
[02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:34.160]   about martial arts is it can be many,
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:36.320]   many different things to many different people.
[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:37.480]   You know, I finally, for instance,
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:40.360]   was able to get a college degree this year.
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:42.480]   That which, I mean, it's not a big deal for most people,
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:43.960]   but for me, it was a big deal because I was--
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:45.080]   - You went back and finished.
[02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:47.520]   - Yeah, and I never envisioned ever going back.
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:48.360]   And you know--
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:50.680]   - That's a hard step to go back and finish.
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:53.920]   That's a, it weighs heavy on you if you don't.
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:54.760]   It's interesting.
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:56.540]   - Yeah, I was just, I was more proud of that
[02:37:56.540 --> 02:37:58.080]   than most things I've ever done, if I'm honest.
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:37:59.900]   You know, and it was neat and I really enjoyed it.
[02:37:59.900 --> 02:38:01.260]   And it was the process of doing it,
[02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:05.000]   but you know, are my academic credentials impressive?
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:06.400]   Like not in the least.
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:09.440]   But for me, it's like it was a big deal for me personally
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:11.880]   to take that step and to go back and do that.
[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:14.800]   And I was proud of the direction.
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:15.960]   And 'cause it would have been easy.
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:16.800]   Like, do I need to do it?
[02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:18.000]   Like, no, I'm, you know, I have business.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:18.840]   I'll do okay.
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:19.960]   I'll try, I'll keep fighting.
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:23.000]   But I was happy to take the time in between fights
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.840]   when I was unbooked for an opponent
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:27.200]   to do something productive,
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:28.400]   rather than just, I'll just hang out.
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:30.000]   You know, like I can still train every single day,
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.400]   but I can also train and go to school.
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:33.160]   People go to the Olympics while going to school.
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:36.060]   I can do martial arts and go to school.
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:40.520]   - One thing I gotta ask is, you know,
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:44.240]   a bunch of women listen to this podcast.
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:45.960]   If they haven't done jujitsu,
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:48.360]   I think it'd be kind of intimidating
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:51.000]   to step on the mat with a bunch of bros
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.540]   that like enjoy somehow killing each other.
[02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:58.600]   Like, how do you succeed in that environment
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:00.360]   to where you can learn this art,
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:02.480]   learn how to beat all those people up?
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:05.040]   - Oh gosh.
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:05.960]   - Is there any advice?
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:07.960]   I mean, another way to ask that is like,
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:11.000]   and you women listening to this
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.520]   are interested in starting jujitsu,
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:14.680]   like is there advice for that journey?
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:17.040]   - Honestly, I think it's just walking in the door
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:18.000]   and starting.
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:19.480]   Sometimes I don't know how to respond to that
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:22.600]   'cause I'm not, I don't view myself as typically anxious,
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:26.660]   particularly in interactions with other people
[02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:27.500]   or new people.
[02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:32.640]   Shy is not a word that has been used for me.
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:35.920]   But if you ask my family and they joke
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:37.200]   'cause our son talks a lot,
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:38.760]   he's advanced verbally and they're always like,
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:41.120]   oh, well, let's, we know where he gets that from.
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:42.720]   Like, 'cause he just doesn't stop talking.
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:44.400]   He narrates everything he does.
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:48.480]   And so they always tease 'cause that's
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:51.100]   like I'm known for kind of talking a lot.
[02:39:51.100 --> 02:39:54.160]   But so I haven't been typically,
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:56.200]   I'm not, I don't consider myself a shy person.
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:59.500]   So for me going into a new room,
[02:39:59.500 --> 02:40:01.400]   a new group of people is,
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:02.440]   you know, there's always a,
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:04.000]   you don't really know who they are,
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:04.940]   how they're gonna treat you.
[02:40:04.940 --> 02:40:08.440]   But I don't have a lot of anxiety with that.
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:10.020]   So I don't, if that's something
[02:40:10.020 --> 02:40:11.240]   that's gonna put something off,
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:15.960]   I don't really know how to address that particular feeling.
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:17.920]   But in terms of all of the rooms I've been in,
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:20.080]   I have popped into jiu-jitsu gyms
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:22.800]   before I knew Ryan in Florida.
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:25.560]   Like I traveled for my jobs in Germany and Florida
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:28.220]   and California and places where I don't know anyone,
[02:40:28.220 --> 02:40:29.580]   they don't know me.
[02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:33.600]   And I have never once had anyone be anything
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:37.520]   other than kind and solicitous and helpful.
[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:40.720]   And long before when I was a white belt and a blue belt
[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:43.220]   and didn't know anything and didn't know anyone.
[02:40:43.220 --> 02:40:48.140]   And I just think that it's a community of people
[02:40:48.140 --> 02:40:51.180]   that it's so cool that no matter where you go in the world,
[02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:54.740]   I walked into a gym in Prague one time
[02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:56.680]   where only two people spoke English.
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:40:59.120]   And it was just--
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:40:59.960]   - Yeah, it's weird.
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:02.000]   - You know, instantly you're like part of a group
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:02.960]   and they're like, "Oh, let me tell you
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:03.920]   what a place to go." - So being part of a cult,
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:04.760]   right? - Yeah.
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:06.400]   - Yeah. - But it's like a positive cult.
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:07.680]   Like for sure--
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:09.760]   - That's what we would say as cultists.
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:11.400]   - Yeah, that's true.
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:12.560]   (laughing)
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:13.400]   That's true.
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:14.960]   I mean, we do need to murder everybody
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:16.240]   who practice Aikido.
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:17.920]   - I mean, yeah.
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:20.520]   - This cult deeply believes in.
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:22.960]   No, but there is a, like if you look at different kinds
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:27.320]   of games like chess and so on, like there's a skepticism.
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:29.880]   I mean, there's not a brotherhood, sisterhood feeling
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:30.720]   with jiu-jitsu.
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:32.560]   It's like you can roll into most places.
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:35.480]   Even like with judo, like I can see the contrast
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:37.720]   'cause I've trained in judo places.
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:42.360]   It's more like tribal.
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:47.040]   Like you walk in and like, "Who is this?"
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:48.400]   Like there's that kind of feeling.
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:50.680]   With jiu-jitsu, there's less so.
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:52.440]   There is a little bit with like the competitors.
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:55.320]   There's always like the competitors feeling each other out,
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:56.720]   usually like the blue belts.
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:01.440]   But like outside of that, in terms of if you don't get the,
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:05.440]   if you walk in with the vibes of just loving the art
[02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:09.600]   and just wanting to have a good time, you're like welcome.
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:10.720]   It's really cool.
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:12.160]   It's really fascinating.
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:14.240]   - It's a really great thing, I think.
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:16.560]   And as a woman, I think you think you're walking
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:20.480]   into these rooms of these big, strong, tough guys.
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:24.520]   And if anything, I would say that they're almost like
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:27.280]   much more solicitous when a woman comes in there
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:29.960]   and not like they're just like hitting on you all the time.
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:32.440]   It's just that you walk in and everyone is like,
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:33.760]   "Oh, cool.
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:35.480]   "You wanna do this thing that I love.
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:37.280]   "Let me make sure you have a good experience
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:38.400]   "and take care of you."
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:41.960]   And I think that's an experience that I hope people have
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:44.680]   when they come into our gym and that I've always felt
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:45.880]   when I walked into other gyms.
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:49.400]   And so we try our best to make that comfortable.
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:52.360]   And it can be a little uncomfortable 'cause there are,
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:54.960]   when you walk into a male-dominated environment,
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:57.520]   there's conversations and topics.
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:42:59.940]   There's a different style of camaraderie and joking
[02:42:59.940 --> 02:43:03.040]   that a lot of men will do that maybe some women
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:04.240]   are more uncomfortable with.
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:06.680]   I grew up with four brothers, so I kind of maybe
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:09.600]   was a little more desensitized to that.
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:12.520]   And I worked for the Department of Defense for a while too.
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:14.440]   So before I-
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:15.820]   - So you're with the government.
[02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:17.720]   - Yeah, so I did that for a while after college.
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:18.920]   - I'm already skeptical.
[02:43:18.920 --> 02:43:19.760]   - Yeah.
[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:21.720]   I left, I left.
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:22.560]   - Oh, you left.
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:23.920]   I'm not gonna ask you about UFOs then
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:25.440]   because you're not gonna tell me the truth.
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:26.280]   - No.
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:27.100]   (laughing)
[02:43:27.100 --> 02:43:27.940]   Fix it.
[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:29.520]   (laughing)
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:31.480]   - Yeah, now you just freaked out a lot of people.
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:32.320]   Okay.
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:34.040]   (laughing)
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:35.800]   But yeah, by the way, where's your school?
[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:37.600]   'Cause people always ask like where-
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:40.160]   - Well, we're outside of Washington, DC
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:42.320]   in Northern Virginia in Falls Church.
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:44.000]   - You always wanna pick like, what's the best school
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:47.400]   if I travel to this place or if I wanna move to this place?
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:48.220]   So that's-
[02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:49.480]   - Well, I mean, obviously we're biased,
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:51.960]   but yeah, we're in the Washington, DC area.
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:53.080]   - The best.
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:54.580]   Okay, we just took a little break.
[02:43:54.580 --> 02:43:55.640]   Now we're back.
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:58.360]   Let me ask you one thing that a bunch of people
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:43:59.520]   are curious about.
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:01.640]   You're one of the innovators.
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:03.840]   First of all, you're one of the great innovators
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:07.520]   and philosophers and thinkers in jiu-jitsu, right?
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:09.160]   But you're also one of the innovators
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:13.400]   in terms of leg locks and the 50/50 position
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:17.200]   and just like the fact that legs have something to do
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:18.100]   in jiu-jitsu.
[02:44:18.100 --> 02:44:24.240]   The other popularizer, innovator in the space
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:26.800]   is Jon Donahuer and his whole group of guys.
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:30.480]   Do you have thoughts about their whole system of leg locks
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:34.040]   and their ideas about jiu-jitsu and so on?
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:34.860]   - Sure.
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:38.440]   I guess, obviously, Jon and the students at HENSO
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:40.820]   who've been able to do fantastic things competitively
[02:44:40.820 --> 02:44:42.280]   in the past number of years.
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:48.400]   You mentioned innovators in that kind of section of jiu-jitsu
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:50.960]   I would be, I'd love to bring up some guys
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:54.240]   like Dean Lister, of course, Masakazu Imanari.
[02:44:54.240 --> 02:44:57.040]   In fact, a lot of what was going on in 90s Japan
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:44:58.560]   like combat submission wrestling,
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:00.020]   there was some crazy gnarly stuff
[02:45:00.020 --> 02:45:02.880]   that it's on grainy VHS tape.
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:04.440]   But stuff that if people were doing now,
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:06.440]   they go, "Oh my God, that's brand new."
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:10.960]   I think these are things that have been around for a while
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:11.880]   in various places.
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:13.720]   I first learned the 50/50 position,
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:17.080]   just like the leg entanglement of it, from Brandon Vera,
[02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:19.160]   actually at a seminar at Lord Irvin's Martial Arts,
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:20.480]   I think in 2005.
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:22.400]   He learned it from Dean Lister
[02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:24.880]   who used it to submit Alexandre Kakareko,
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:28.280]   really, really tough no-gi guy at ADCC in the run
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:31.640]   that Dean made to the gold medal in the absolute division,
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:33.220]   which was a great performance at the time,
[02:45:33.220 --> 02:45:34.600]   first American to do that.
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:38.240]   And I actually saw a video,
[02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:40.160]   I mean, first of all, Bas Rutten actually broke,
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:43.480]   I think Guy Mezger's foot with a 50/50 heel hook.
[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:46.000]   He actually grabbed his heel and his toes
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:46.880]   and went (imitates cracking)
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:49.280]   and in pancreas, it's back when they had like the man panties
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:51.160]   and the high boots on.
[02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:52.360]   And dude, that was gnarly.
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:54.520]   Bas Rutten is underappreciated.
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:56.920]   - He double grabbed and just--
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:45:59.520]   - Oh yeah, his leverage is leverage.
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:01.800]   That's like a toehold that goes the other way
[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:04.720]   and it's like it either doesn't work or breaks in half.
[02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:07.800]   - Well, people don't often think of Bas Rutten
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:10.320]   as an innovator, but he is, in a way.
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:15.640]   Talk about Elon Musk and first principles thinking
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:18.320]   in terms of physics, he just feels like
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:19.600]   he just gets the job.
[02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:22.320]   He figures out the simplest way to get the job done
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:25.040]   of breaking things and establishing control
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:25.920]   and hurting people.
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:27.240]   - Remember that was back in the day,
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:29.400]   if you listen to Bas Rutten do any commentary
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:32.520]   for any of the big MMA shows or any MMA show way back when,
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:33.480]   anytime guys were clinching,
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:34.680]   he's like, "The guys roll for a knee bar."
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:36.000]   He was saying that way back when
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.640]   and now people are doing it all the time
[02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:39.440]   with varying degrees of success.
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:41.920]   It's funny, it's also tough to be,
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:43.240]   I think like a breakaway thinker.
[02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:46.160]   I mean, group think is a real thing and group inertia
[02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:50.400]   and it's neat to see, particularly at a time
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:53.680]   when maybe that type of stuff was less accepted,
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:56.480]   someone going, "Hey, I'm gonna run off
[02:46:56.480 --> 02:46:57.480]   "in this other direction."
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:01.000]   I think whoever, the inventor of electricity in my mind
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.480]   is a lot more impressive than whomever,
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:05.680]   not to say that the person down the line isn't impressive,
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:08.400]   that comes up with an interesting way to use it.
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:11.160]   Both are cool, but when you think about,
[02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:12.600]   just can you imagine we're sitting here,
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:14.320]   we're like, "Yeah, people, I'm gonna build an airplane."
[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:15.520]   You're like, "What are you talking about?"
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:16.760]   - Crazy. - People don't fly.
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:17.800]   I'm like, "No, I'm gonna do it."
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:19.200]   And of course, it's not gonna be as good
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:20.360]   as the airplane down the line,
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:22.320]   the iterative things that happen later on,
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:26.400]   but just being able to go to dream something into existence
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:29.120]   that you haven't seen before and then make it happen,
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:31.640]   takes an unbelievable strength of character,
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:33.160]   almost like a force of will,
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:36.160]   because you're blazing a trail
[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:37.880]   that hasn't been walked before.
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:39.280]   That's the BJ Penn factor
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:42.080]   in winning the Jiu-Jitsu World Championship,
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:43.520]   first non-Brazilian to do that.
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:44.960]   That was back in 2001.
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:46.760]   And then Rafael Lovato later on,
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:50.000]   both of those guys are so unbelievably impressive
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:51.800]   in my mind for the same reason,
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:54.600]   because they were out there winning at a time
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:56.560]   when that wasn't a common thing.
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:47:57.960]   Not that it's easy to win now,
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:00.240]   it's just there's not a psychological hurdle
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:01.480]   that needs to be left.
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:03.320]   I remember when I was early in Jiu-Jitsu,
[02:48:03.320 --> 02:48:05.240]   Americans weren't winning the World Championships
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:06.600]   at any belt.
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:08.400]   We all knew BJ Penn because BJ Penn did it,
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:10.520]   but it was really, really uncommon.
[02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:12.920]   Now it happens on a semi-regular basis.
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:14.160]   Of course, the Brazilians are still strong,
[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:15.680]   Europeans are still strong,
[02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:18.080]   and Australians are coming on as well.
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:20.800]   But it's definitely kind of an interesting thing.
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:24.320]   So to come back to John Danaher and the HENSO team,
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:26.240]   obviously they're doing fantastic things.
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:28.520]   John's had some really, really great innovation there.
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:31.920]   And the systematization and the methodology
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:33.920]   that they're using is great,
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:36.280]   and it's neat to see that it's getting out there.
[02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:39.200]   I would just also, I would encourage people
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:42.040]   to make sure that they're catching up on their history,
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:43.720]   'cause obviously John's a brilliant instructor
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:47.760]   and has done things for the sport that are fantastic
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:48.640]   that haven't been done before.
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:50.520]   But none of us exist in a vacuum,
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:51.880]   and I've learned things from everywhere else.
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:54.000]   So John would say the same, I'm sure.
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.120]   And Dean Lister would say the same.
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:58.240]   And it's just neat when you can kind of trace
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:48:59.760]   the history of all of this happening,
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:02.120]   because we've had, humanity's had two arms and two legs
[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:04.560]   for some time, at least as long as I've been alive.
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:06.360]   - But you mentioned airplanes.
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:08.000]   Do you think there's something totally new
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:09.640]   to be invented in Jiu-Jitsu still?
[02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:12.880]   Not totally new, but like the, you know,
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:16.240]   flying isn't new, but airplanes nevertheless
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:17.560]   made that much more efficient.
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:22.400]   Is there like new ideas to be discovered in Jiu-Jitsu still?
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:24.160]   - I'd say, the reason I'd say yes
[02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:26.120]   is the same reason I would say I believe in alchemy,
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:27.400]   even though I don't.
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:28.240]   No, I'm serious.
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:29.960]   Like, I've got some backing for this.
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:30.800]   - Okay.
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:32.360]   - You know, I guess I talk about this
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:34.320]   with a buddy of mine a lot, like,
[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:38.600]   and facilitative versus not facilitative beliefs.
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:41.640]   And if I don't believe something is possible
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:44.000]   and I do no investigation towards it,
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:45.840]   I'll never find something, even if it's there.
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:47.880]   It's almost like, it's no different than me walking up
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:49.280]   on a group of people and going like,
[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:50.800]   "Oh man, look at these jerks.
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:51.920]   This is gonna suck."
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:53.960]   Versus me going, "Oh, I wonder what these guys are up to."
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:56.020]   I'm about to have two very different conversations,
[02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:57.840]   even though the players in the game are no different.
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:49:59.560]   My internal constitution has changed
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:02.840]   because of how I've decided to approach the situation.
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:05.600]   So although I wouldn't personally want to spend all my time
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:07.080]   trying to turn lead into gold,
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:09.360]   because I don't believe that it's likely to work,
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:12.080]   only a person who's willing to spend his or her life
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:14.340]   in that pursuit will actually get to the bottom of that.
[02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:16.220]   And also in the pursuit of that,
[02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:18.280]   they're likely to find other things.
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:20.440]   So I think a lot of times the idea is that humanity
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:21.840]   is pushed forward by, you know,
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:23.520]   again, it's another Orson Scott Carbon.
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:25.720]   It's like, you know, human beings are in this slog.
[02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:28.280]   It's, I'll paraphrase, just in this slog over time.
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:31.200]   And then periodically, humanity gives birth to genius,
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:32.680]   like someone that invents the wheel,
[02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:35.140]   invents electricity, pushes us forward, you know,
[02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:37.560]   comes up with the idea of governance that doesn't,
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:40.360]   you know, just start and end with the point of a sword,
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:43.480]   you know, and, you know, these aren't common things.
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:45.920]   These are unbelievable advancements that, you know,
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:47.080]   that I'm not just me sitting here.
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:49.180]   I didn't come up with them, but I just get the benefit of it.
[02:50:49.180 --> 02:50:50.920]   So I guess what I would say is a lot of times
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:52.720]   these ideas are called crazy, you know,
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:54.400]   like as we discussed on kind of offline,
[02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:57.440]   it's like, you know, Einstein was brilliant in his twenties
[02:50:57.440 --> 02:50:59.800]   and it was brilliant before that, I would suspect,
[02:50:59.800 --> 02:51:01.200]   but basically, you know,
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:03.080]   gets recognized later on in life.
[02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:05.220]   And of course we all thought those were great ideas.
[02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:06.460]   The man was probably roundly mocked
[02:51:06.460 --> 02:51:08.340]   for giant chunks of his life.
[02:51:08.340 --> 02:51:10.740]   And I guess, so it's neat to,
[02:51:10.740 --> 02:51:13.200]   I would say there's definitely in my mind things that,
[02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:15.580]   even if it's just combinations and new to me,
[02:51:15.580 --> 02:51:16.780]   new ways to see things,
[02:51:16.780 --> 02:51:19.280]   new ways to understand different depth of understanding,
[02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:22.020]   possibly new things, new positions, new ideas,
[02:51:22.020 --> 02:51:25.220]   because even if that's not true,
[02:51:25.220 --> 02:51:28.060]   the process of going through and acting as if it is
[02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:29.700]   and believing like that and focusing
[02:51:29.700 --> 02:51:32.700]   and trying to investigate will make any of us,
[02:51:32.700 --> 02:51:34.140]   will push us all forward.
[02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:35.760]   Whereas sitting there, you know,
[02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:38.140]   obsessing over the cult of our current knowledge,
[02:51:38.140 --> 02:51:41.200]   I think is the biggest danger
[02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:44.060]   and the biggest cause of stagnation that exists anywhere.
[02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:48.580]   - Yeah, and it starts with believing the impossible,
[02:51:48.580 --> 02:51:49.740]   which is kind of interesting.
[02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:51.240]   One of the things that's really inspiring to me
[02:51:51.240 --> 02:51:55.160]   is to see people out there, which sadly are rare,
[02:51:55.160 --> 02:52:00.160]   who kind of have a combination of two things.
[02:52:00.820 --> 02:52:04.500]   One is they have a worldview that involves,
[02:52:04.500 --> 02:52:07.140]   that includes a lot of ideas that are crazy.
[02:52:07.140 --> 02:52:10.740]   And the second part is they're exceptionally focused
[02:52:10.740 --> 02:52:13.380]   and competent in bringing that,
[02:52:13.380 --> 02:52:16.140]   whatever the ideas in that worldview to reality.
[02:52:16.140 --> 02:52:18.540]   So there's certainly a lot of people with crazy ideas.
[02:52:18.540 --> 02:52:20.140]   You know, there's a lot of conspiracy theorists.
[02:52:20.140 --> 02:52:23.060]   They have way out there beliefs about things,
[02:52:23.060 --> 02:52:27.420]   but they're not doing much to like make the,
[02:52:27.420 --> 02:52:29.620]   like build stuff grounded in that.
[02:52:29.620 --> 02:52:31.540]   Like they're not engineers or whatever.
[02:52:31.540 --> 02:52:33.620]   They're just like espousing different crazy ideas.
[02:52:33.620 --> 02:52:36.620]   But that's why you get like the Elon Musk type characters.
[02:52:36.620 --> 02:52:38.180]   And the reason I bring him up a lot
[02:52:38.180 --> 02:52:41.100]   is 'cause like there's not many others to bring up.
[02:52:41.100 --> 02:52:44.580]   It's like, there's not many examples of it through history.
[02:52:44.580 --> 02:52:47.380]   The people, I mean, the guy's convinced
[02:52:47.380 --> 02:52:49.700]   that we're going to colonize Mars.
[02:52:49.700 --> 02:52:54.700]   And basically everybody on earth thinks that's insane.
[02:52:54.700 --> 02:52:58.340]   - Everyone except the guy that's gonna do it, right?
[02:52:58.340 --> 02:52:59.500]   - Except that's gonna do it.
[02:52:59.500 --> 02:53:03.540]   And like, you can imagine like a couple of hundred years
[02:53:03.540 --> 02:53:07.500]   from now people will, I mean, first of all,
[02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:09.900]   they won't, certainly won't remember the haters.
[02:53:09.900 --> 02:53:12.140]   They won't remember all the people.
[02:53:12.140 --> 02:53:15.740]   If they do remember them, they'll remember them in a sense
[02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:17.220]   like people were silly to think
[02:53:17.220 --> 02:53:20.540]   that this isn't the obvious path forward.
[02:53:20.540 --> 02:53:24.900]   Like from a perspective, that's what Elon talks about.
[02:53:24.900 --> 02:53:27.300]   Like it's obvious they were going to expand
[02:53:27.300 --> 02:53:28.940]   throughout the universe.
[02:53:28.940 --> 02:53:30.660]   Like so-- - From his perspective.
[02:53:30.660 --> 02:53:32.500]   - From his perspective.
[02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:34.460]   But to me it is also obvious
[02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:37.300]   because like either we destroy ourselves
[02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:40.500]   or we'll expand beyond earth.
[02:53:40.500 --> 02:53:45.820]   Like there's not many, well,
[02:53:45.820 --> 02:53:47.420]   maybe it's not completely obvious.
[02:53:47.420 --> 02:53:49.340]   I guess I share that worldview.
[02:53:49.340 --> 02:53:52.340]   There's the other possibility that we humans find
[02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:56.460]   a sort of an inner peace where the forces of capitalism
[02:53:56.460 --> 02:53:58.980]   will calm down and we'll all just meditate
[02:53:58.980 --> 02:54:00.980]   and do yoga and jujitsu and like relax
[02:54:00.980 --> 02:54:02.540]   with this whole tech thing
[02:54:02.540 --> 02:54:04.140]   where we keep building new technologies.
[02:54:04.140 --> 02:54:06.980]   But it's cool to have those kinds of people
[02:54:06.980 --> 02:54:11.260]   that just believe the big, ambitious, crazy dreams
[02:54:11.260 --> 02:54:12.460]   'cause that's where it starts.
[02:54:12.460 --> 02:54:13.740]   If you wanna build something special,
[02:54:13.740 --> 02:54:16.060]   you have to first believe that.
[02:54:16.060 --> 02:54:17.620]   - When you also have to believe strongly enough
[02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:20.260]   that you're not vulnerable and I'm speculating,
[02:54:20.260 --> 02:54:21.900]   but it's like, I can only imagine how many people
[02:54:21.900 --> 02:54:24.900]   have told Elon that what he's doing is crazy.
[02:54:24.900 --> 02:54:26.380]   So not only did he dream it up,
[02:54:26.380 --> 02:54:27.780]   he dreamed it up, went with it
[02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:31.100]   and also went with it in the face of being told
[02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:32.340]   that it's not gonna work.
[02:54:32.340 --> 02:54:35.260]   And then also stepped away from the bitterness
[02:54:35.260 --> 02:54:38.380]   'cause he's done a series of really crazy, impressive things
[02:54:38.380 --> 02:54:40.900]   and that's only those little things that I'm aware of.
[02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:42.500]   And also staying away from the bitterness
[02:54:42.500 --> 02:54:44.420]   of every single time you did something good,
[02:54:44.420 --> 02:54:47.140]   initially all I do is talk down about you
[02:54:47.140 --> 02:54:49.300]   and then eventually I act as, of course, of course,
[02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:50.820]   I never apologize.
[02:54:50.820 --> 02:54:53.220]   And yet you don't let that dampen your spirits
[02:54:53.220 --> 02:54:55.660]   for the next innovation, which is pretty incredible
[02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:56.780]   to me to watch.
[02:54:56.780 --> 02:54:57.780]   - Yeah, it's kinda cool.
[02:54:57.780 --> 02:55:01.020]   I mean, it's contagious to spend time with the guy
[02:55:01.020 --> 02:55:04.620]   because he's not, Rogen has the same look to him,
[02:55:04.620 --> 02:55:06.660]   which is interesting about these people.
[02:55:06.660 --> 02:55:12.560]   There's like a hater shield.
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:15.980]   That he's like, he doesn't even like sense them,
[02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:16.940]   it feels like.
[02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:22.900]   He thinks to Elon, it's like, it's obvious.
[02:55:22.900 --> 02:55:26.100]   I mean, he keeps calling it like first principles thinking.
[02:55:26.100 --> 02:55:28.380]   Like physics says it's true, therefore it's true.
[02:55:28.380 --> 02:55:31.820]   Like he's convinced himself that like his beliefs
[02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:33.940]   are grounded in the fundamental fabric
[02:55:33.940 --> 02:55:35.740]   of the way the universe works,
[02:55:35.740 --> 02:55:38.100]   therefore the haters don't matter.
[02:55:38.100 --> 02:55:40.100]   And I mean, that's kind of like a system of thought
[02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:42.580]   he developed himself through all the difficulty,
[02:55:42.580 --> 02:55:45.000]   through all the doubt, he's able to take huge risks
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.940]   with basically putting everything he owes on the line
[02:55:47.940 --> 02:55:49.820]   multiple times throughout his life.
[02:55:49.820 --> 02:55:52.180]   Amidst all the drama, amidst all the doubts,
[02:55:52.180 --> 02:55:55.420]   amidst all like the, he's still able to make
[02:55:55.420 --> 02:55:58.740]   just clear, clear headed decisions.
[02:55:58.740 --> 02:56:01.180]   I don't know what to make of it, but it's inspiring as hell.
[02:56:01.180 --> 02:56:02.740]   - Well, I think it's something that's funny.
[02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:05.380]   I think like, I can only imagine the, you know,
[02:56:05.380 --> 02:56:07.740]   history will look back on him as a brilliant person,
[02:56:07.740 --> 02:56:09.620]   but that's not the only, there's a lot of,
[02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:11.860]   maybe not statistically speaking,
[02:56:11.860 --> 02:56:13.620]   but a lot numerically on a giant planet
[02:56:13.620 --> 02:56:16.520]   of billions of people, a lot of brilliant people.
[02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:18.620]   Well, you know, time, place, luck, fortune,
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:20.780]   all that other stuff, but at the same time,
[02:56:20.780 --> 02:56:23.660]   that clearly isn't the only determining thing
[02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:25.340]   in making Elon Musk, Elon Musk.
[02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:27.620]   And obviously I don't know the guy from Adam,
[02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:30.620]   but it's an interesting thing that it's not just his
[02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:33.300]   intellect, his belief system, his structure,
[02:56:33.300 --> 02:56:34.420]   how he's viewing the world.
[02:56:34.420 --> 02:56:37.580]   Like that's, did he reason his way to that?
[02:56:37.580 --> 02:56:38.400]   Did he not?
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:39.380]   What other factors came in?
[02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:41.980]   I'm really curious about that because I guess coming,
[02:56:41.980 --> 02:56:45.380]   it's, again, I feel really strongly about
[02:56:45.380 --> 02:56:48.140]   people's belief structure and this,
[02:56:48.140 --> 02:56:50.500]   how they view the world being more important
[02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:52.500]   than the engine behind it.
[02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:54.900]   You know, it makes someone resilient or not.
[02:56:54.900 --> 02:56:56.780]   It makes someone positive or not,
[02:56:56.780 --> 02:56:57.860]   because you could have 10,000,
[02:56:57.860 --> 02:56:59.700]   I think about this for competitive stuff.
[02:56:59.700 --> 02:57:01.340]   You could have 10,000 things going properly
[02:57:01.340 --> 02:57:02.500]   and one thing going improperly.
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:03.700]   If you focus on the improper,
[02:57:03.700 --> 02:57:05.380]   you'll probably fix it at a certain point,
[02:57:05.380 --> 02:57:08.380]   which is good, facilitative for development in the longterm.
[02:57:08.380 --> 02:57:10.940]   But if you had to go and try to perform a task
[02:57:10.940 --> 02:57:12.380]   in the next five minutes,
[02:57:12.380 --> 02:57:13.580]   and you're focusing on the negative,
[02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:17.140]   your confidence and your belief in the positive outcome
[02:57:17.140 --> 02:57:19.060]   of the future is likely to be damaged.
[02:57:19.060 --> 02:57:21.180]   Whereas you could have 25 things going wrong,
[02:57:21.180 --> 02:57:22.860]   but you go, man, I sure am happy to be alive.
[02:57:22.860 --> 02:57:23.700]   How fortunate I am.
[02:57:23.700 --> 02:57:24.520]   This is great.
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:25.580]   I have problems to solve.
[02:57:25.580 --> 02:57:26.700]   This is awesome.
[02:57:26.700 --> 02:57:29.700]   Versus I list the problems and I start bitching about them.
[02:57:29.700 --> 02:57:31.660]   Both of them are technically accurate,
[02:57:31.660 --> 02:57:32.940]   but it's, I guess, different lenses.
[02:57:32.940 --> 02:57:35.240]   And I think that's a really neat thing to see,
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:37.820]   you know, someone exemplifying that for us.
[02:57:37.820 --> 02:57:42.680]   - So maybe to look at the fighting world,
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:46.060]   there's a million questions I can ask here.
[02:57:46.060 --> 02:57:48.420]   Like one, you mentioned B.J. Penn.
[02:57:48.420 --> 02:57:51.180]   You, first of all, you're undefeated in the UFC.
[02:57:51.180 --> 02:57:54.340]   And one of the fights you've had is against B.J. Penn,
[02:57:54.340 --> 02:57:57.460]   which is kind of an incredible fight.
[02:57:57.460 --> 02:57:59.660]   You won performance of the night.
[02:57:59.660 --> 02:58:04.300]   What did it feel like to face B.J. Penn
[02:58:04.300 --> 02:58:07.380]   and to beat him definitively as you did?
[02:58:07.380 --> 02:58:09.340]   Like what's that whole experience like?
[02:58:09.340 --> 02:58:11.300]   - I'll be honest, I didn't know if I was going
[02:58:11.300 --> 02:58:12.960]   to ever be able to fight again
[02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:15.740]   after beating Gray Maynard in 2016.
[02:58:15.740 --> 02:58:17.740]   And I've had a couple of periods of those.
[02:58:17.740 --> 02:58:19.660]   I was about to join the army actually,
[02:58:19.660 --> 02:58:23.340]   and when I was 30, before the UFC,
[02:58:23.340 --> 02:58:25.460]   before Jen sent me over to Ultimate Fighter,
[02:58:25.460 --> 02:58:26.300]   I didn't want to go.
[02:58:26.300 --> 02:58:27.700]   'Cause I was like, one, they're never going to pick me.
[02:58:27.700 --> 02:58:29.060]   Two, I'd be terrible for TV.
[02:58:29.060 --> 02:58:30.100]   Three, I'll probably say something,
[02:58:30.100 --> 02:58:32.780]   and I'm going to get burned to death in the streets.
[02:58:32.780 --> 02:58:34.940]   You know, I'm like, this isn't a great idea.
[02:58:34.940 --> 02:58:37.340]   And then she said, "Well, go out there, see what happens.
[02:58:37.340 --> 02:58:38.180]   "Do it anyway.
[02:58:38.180 --> 02:58:39.780]   "You'll regret it if you didn't."
[02:58:39.780 --> 02:58:41.380]   And then I ended up doing Ultimate Fighter.
[02:58:41.380 --> 02:58:43.580]   And then, so I fought three times on the show,
[02:58:43.580 --> 02:58:47.780]   and then I fought for the finale.
[02:58:47.780 --> 02:58:50.380]   So that's four times in like five or six months,
[02:58:50.380 --> 02:58:51.340]   which was great.
[02:58:51.340 --> 02:58:54.260]   And then it took me a year to get another opponent.
[02:58:54.260 --> 02:58:55.580]   And that was Gray Maynard.
[02:58:55.580 --> 02:58:57.860]   And then Gray was obviously a very tough guy.
[02:58:57.860 --> 02:58:59.100]   Managed to get a good outcome there.
[02:58:59.100 --> 02:59:02.740]   Then it took two years to fight BJ Penn.
[02:59:02.740 --> 02:59:04.300]   And that was, you know, obviously I'm training
[02:59:04.300 --> 02:59:06.940]   all the time, every single day, and that never stops.
[02:59:06.940 --> 02:59:09.340]   But that was, I'll be honest, like pretty deeply frustrating
[02:59:09.340 --> 02:59:11.580]   'cause, you know, as a human being, as an athlete,
[02:59:11.580 --> 02:59:13.340]   you know, I think as an athlete, you die twice.
[02:59:13.340 --> 02:59:15.860]   Like you have an athletic peak or area,
[02:59:15.860 --> 02:59:17.740]   and then you go on with the rest of your life.
[02:59:17.740 --> 02:59:19.740]   But it is a microcosm for the rest of your life.
[02:59:19.740 --> 02:59:21.780]   It's like you're seeing the sand tick away
[02:59:21.780 --> 02:59:23.700]   in the hourglass or drop away.
[02:59:23.700 --> 02:59:26.300]   And you're going, "Man, these are the years
[02:59:26.300 --> 02:59:27.860]   "between 31, 32, 33.
[02:59:27.860 --> 02:59:29.380]   "I'll be at my best at this time,
[02:59:29.380 --> 02:59:30.780]   "my absolute best physically.
[02:59:30.780 --> 02:59:32.800]   "Now, not technically, I'm a lot better now
[02:59:32.800 --> 02:59:34.220]   "than I was before in our plan."
[02:59:34.220 --> 02:59:36.020]   But at a certain point, you will,
[02:59:36.020 --> 02:59:37.020]   unless you're Bernard Hopkins,
[02:59:37.020 --> 02:59:38.900]   you will reach diminishing returns.
[02:59:38.900 --> 02:59:40.940]   And I guess that-- - The long wait,
[02:59:40.940 --> 02:59:42.660]   you can feel the clock ticking.
[02:59:42.660 --> 02:59:44.020]   It's frustrating. - Yeah.
[02:59:44.020 --> 02:59:46.700]   - Why did it take two years for BJ?
[02:59:46.700 --> 02:59:49.940]   That's the question people ask a lot.
[02:59:49.940 --> 02:59:52.380]   It's like, "Why does nobody want to fight, Ryan?"
[02:59:52.380 --> 02:59:53.220]   - I don't know.
[02:59:53.220 --> 02:59:54.540]   They probably think they'll get infected
[02:59:54.540 --> 02:59:57.260]   by whatever this is, but I don't blame 'em.
[02:59:57.260 --> 02:59:58.780]   But I wouldn't want to-- - I mean, you're a really
[02:59:58.780 --> 03:00:00.900]   tough opponent is the bottom line.
[03:00:00.900 --> 03:00:02.060]   - I'll say that I'm different.
[03:00:02.060 --> 03:00:05.020]   Maybe they perceive that the threat
[03:00:05.020 --> 03:00:06.300]   is greater than the reward.
[03:00:06.300 --> 03:00:08.420]   I'm hoping that now that we're ranked number 12,
[03:00:08.420 --> 03:00:11.880]   you know, in the UFC rankings, that that will change.
[03:00:11.880 --> 03:00:13.820]   And I know that if we're one more win
[03:00:13.820 --> 03:00:15.420]   and then we're in the top 10,
[03:00:15.420 --> 03:00:17.780]   that now you're there.
[03:00:17.780 --> 03:00:19.500]   But what I've consistently found
[03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:20.900]   is that like randoms wanna fight,
[03:00:20.900 --> 03:00:22.100]   and I'm like, "Go away.
[03:00:22.100 --> 03:00:23.580]   I didn't come here for you."
[03:00:23.580 --> 03:00:24.920]   'Cause if I wanted to just fight anybody,
[03:00:24.920 --> 03:00:26.260]   I could go down to a Waffle House
[03:00:26.260 --> 03:00:28.860]   and yell until like DMX shows up and we can fight,
[03:00:28.860 --> 03:00:29.860]   'cause he'll be at the Waffle House too.
[03:00:29.860 --> 03:00:30.700]   Who am I kidding?
[03:00:30.700 --> 03:00:31.660]   I really wanna hang out with DMX.
[03:00:31.660 --> 03:00:34.420]   But it's like, you wanna, when I had the opportunity--
[03:00:34.420 --> 03:00:35.460]   - Brian Hall and DMX at Waffle House.
[03:00:35.460 --> 03:00:37.260]   - Oh my God, that was so cool.
[03:00:37.260 --> 03:00:38.740]   I would never-- - Sounds like a Netflix show
[03:00:38.740 --> 03:00:39.900]   or something. - I would never fight DMX.
[03:00:39.900 --> 03:00:40.740]   We'd be on the same team.
[03:00:40.740 --> 03:00:42.620]   - No. - But anyway,
[03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:47.020]   I guess I accepted fights against,
[03:00:47.020 --> 03:00:49.340]   I got asked about Lamas, I said yes.
[03:00:49.340 --> 03:00:52.380]   I got asked about Dennis Bermudez, I said yes.
[03:00:52.380 --> 03:00:55.220]   Like long periods of time, and at that time,
[03:00:55.220 --> 03:00:57.900]   in between 2016 and 2018,
[03:00:57.900 --> 03:01:01.900]   I was struggling to have opponents who would sign up.
[03:01:01.900 --> 03:01:04.500]   And so I haven't turned down fights.
[03:01:04.500 --> 03:01:06.340]   I've just said, "Hey, keep the,
[03:01:06.340 --> 03:01:08.020]   I don't care about fighting the randoms."
[03:01:08.020 --> 03:01:09.100]   And it's just-- - And you have
[03:01:09.100 --> 03:01:10.220]   a successful school.
[03:01:10.220 --> 03:01:12.700]   You're like, you're running,
[03:01:12.700 --> 03:01:15.540]   you're a martial artist, broadly speaking.
[03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:18.140]   So it doesn't make sense to take fights
[03:01:18.140 --> 03:01:19.580]   that aren't like-- - Right.
[03:01:19.580 --> 03:01:22.580]   - That fit a certain kind of trajectory for your career.
[03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:24.020]   - And that's when BJ apparently said,
[03:01:24.020 --> 03:01:25.540]   "Well, BJ's looking for an opponent."
[03:01:25.540 --> 03:01:27.020]   I was like, "I'm your guy."
[03:01:27.020 --> 03:01:29.820]   And I think that BJ accepted that fight
[03:01:29.820 --> 03:01:31.420]   because I'm another jujitsu guy.
[03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:33.820]   I don't think he perceived that I was much
[03:01:33.820 --> 03:01:35.780]   of a threat on the feet.
[03:01:35.780 --> 03:01:39.900]   And I was able to, it was neat to get it
[03:01:39.900 --> 03:01:43.220]   to compete against someone who's one of my heroes,
[03:01:43.220 --> 03:01:44.900]   one of the people I looked up to in MMA
[03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:45.900]   for the longest time.
[03:01:45.900 --> 03:01:47.180]   - Were you intimidated by that?
[03:01:47.180 --> 03:01:48.980]   - No, no, I love competing.
[03:01:48.980 --> 03:01:51.860]   I don't really get nervous or scared before fights.
[03:01:51.860 --> 03:01:52.820]   I'm not afraid to get hurt.
[03:01:52.820 --> 03:01:53.740]   I'm not afraid to win.
[03:01:53.740 --> 03:01:55.100]   I'm not afraid to lose.
[03:01:55.100 --> 03:01:57.020]   I'm just excited for the,
[03:01:57.020 --> 03:01:59.020]   I feel thankful for the opportunity to compete
[03:01:59.020 --> 03:02:01.380]   and the opportunity to play when it matters.
[03:02:01.380 --> 03:02:04.740]   But that's the only time I'm interested
[03:02:04.740 --> 03:02:06.500]   in playing anymore is when it matters,
[03:02:06.500 --> 03:02:08.940]   when the opposition is, I know that,
[03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:11.660]   it's funny 'cause people pick on a lot of,
[03:02:11.660 --> 03:02:13.820]   some opponents, particularly after the fact.
[03:02:13.820 --> 03:02:15.500]   Like if you get a good outcome,
[03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:17.100]   well then, of course, let's beat that guy.
[03:02:17.100 --> 03:02:17.940]   That guy wasn't that good.
[03:02:17.940 --> 03:02:19.900]   I'm like, well, I wasn't, that's after the fact,
[03:02:19.900 --> 03:02:20.940]   I get to say that.
[03:02:20.940 --> 03:02:22.860]   And also as the person in the ring,
[03:02:22.860 --> 03:02:26.980]   BJ Penn has hurt a lot of people in mixed martial arts cage.
[03:02:26.980 --> 03:02:30.500]   And I could actually absolutely have been on that list.
[03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:32.740]   So it was neat to get to compete against someone
[03:02:32.740 --> 03:02:33.660]   that I really respect,
[03:02:33.660 --> 03:02:35.380]   someone that I looked up to for a long time,
[03:02:35.380 --> 03:02:37.660]   someone who has a great skillset.
[03:02:37.660 --> 03:02:39.420]   And also I went up in weight to fight him
[03:02:39.420 --> 03:02:40.260]   at his weight class.
[03:02:40.260 --> 03:02:41.340]   He didn't have to come down to mine,
[03:02:41.340 --> 03:02:42.180]   which is where he'd take.
[03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:43.020]   Which was lightweight?
[03:02:43.020 --> 03:02:44.100]   It was lightweight, yeah.
[03:02:44.100 --> 03:02:44.940]   Generally a featherweight.
[03:02:44.940 --> 03:02:46.900]   I walk around at like 158 pounds.
[03:02:46.900 --> 03:02:47.740]   So.
[03:02:47.740 --> 03:02:49.740]   What's lightweight and featherweight?
[03:02:49.740 --> 03:02:52.180]   Lightweight is 155 with a day before weigh-in
[03:02:52.180 --> 03:02:54.340]   and featherweight is 145 with a day before weigh-in.
[03:02:54.340 --> 03:02:57.380]   So I'm a little bit more properly sized for featherweight.
[03:02:57.380 --> 03:03:01.220]   But anyway, so I didn't feel like,
[03:03:01.220 --> 03:03:03.620]   obviously he was giving up a couple of years of age,
[03:03:03.620 --> 03:03:06.420]   but I was giving up size and all this other stuff.
[03:03:06.420 --> 03:03:08.940]   And it was, I was just excited to have the opportunity
[03:03:08.940 --> 03:03:11.140]   to step in against someone like BJ.
[03:03:11.140 --> 03:03:14.660]   And we managed to get out of there with a good outcome
[03:03:14.660 --> 03:03:16.420]   without getting too banged up.
[03:03:16.420 --> 03:03:19.260]   But just, it was cool 'cause we tied up on the fence
[03:03:19.260 --> 03:03:21.260]   and just even the second,
[03:03:21.260 --> 03:03:23.340]   is when you're rolling with somebody and you touch
[03:03:23.340 --> 03:03:24.220]   and you can feel what they're doing,
[03:03:24.220 --> 03:03:26.060]   you go, "Oh man, this guy's really good."
[03:03:26.060 --> 03:03:27.060]   You can feel the calm,
[03:03:27.060 --> 03:03:28.740]   you can feel the small minor adjustments
[03:03:28.740 --> 03:03:29.580]   that they're making,
[03:03:29.580 --> 03:03:30.860]   the subtle things that they're doing.
[03:03:30.860 --> 03:03:32.380]   And that was one of those things
[03:03:32.380 --> 03:03:33.500]   that was really neat and gratifying
[03:03:33.500 --> 03:03:35.380]   because you never know,
[03:03:35.380 --> 03:03:36.820]   sometimes people that you've heard of
[03:03:36.820 --> 03:03:38.500]   are a little bit less technically proficient
[03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:39.340]   than you thought.
[03:03:39.340 --> 03:03:40.740]   And other times you'll meet some guy that you're training,
[03:03:40.740 --> 03:03:41.740]   like, "Who the hell is this guy?
[03:03:41.740 --> 03:03:43.460]   "How have I not heard of this person?"
[03:03:43.460 --> 03:03:46.620]   And BJ was exactly, as a jujitsu guy,
[03:03:46.620 --> 03:03:47.620]   what I would have thought.
[03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:50.060]   And another thing, that's another thing that bugged me
[03:03:50.060 --> 03:03:53.020]   about how people reacted after the fight is,
[03:03:53.020 --> 03:03:54.820]   basically going, "Oh, BJ screwed up this,
[03:03:54.820 --> 03:03:55.660]   "screwed up that."
[03:03:55.660 --> 03:03:57.740]   And I'm like, "All right, yeah, tell us."
[03:03:57.740 --> 03:03:58.580]   That's so interesting.
[03:03:58.580 --> 03:04:00.380]   That's sad.
[03:04:00.380 --> 03:04:04.860]   That was one of the, to me, I mean, as a fan of both,
[03:04:04.860 --> 03:04:06.100]   that was a beautiful moment,
[03:04:06.100 --> 03:04:10.860]   is a kind of passing of a torch, in a sense,
[03:04:10.860 --> 03:04:13.220]   of exceptional performance.
[03:04:13.220 --> 03:04:15.980]   Like another one that stands out to me,
[03:04:15.980 --> 03:04:20.180]   maybe you can comment, is I don't understand,
[03:04:20.180 --> 03:04:21.980]   well, maybe I do, why Conor McGregor
[03:04:21.980 --> 03:04:23.540]   gets as much hate as he does.
[03:04:23.540 --> 03:04:26.540]   He probably revels in it.
[03:04:26.540 --> 03:04:31.540]   But I think he doesn't get enough credit for Jose Aldo,
[03:04:34.260 --> 03:04:38.940]   for basically knocking him out
[03:04:38.940 --> 03:04:43.940]   in the first few seconds of a fight.
[03:04:43.940 --> 03:04:48.180]   I mean, Jose is one of the greatest fighters ever.
[03:04:48.180 --> 03:04:49.220]   - That's true.
[03:04:49.220 --> 03:04:51.900]   - Maybe some people could even put him in the top 10.
[03:04:51.900 --> 03:04:52.740]   - No question.
[03:04:52.740 --> 03:04:57.740]   - And I don't understand why it doesn't get as much,
[03:04:57.740 --> 03:05:02.900]   like Conor McGregor doesn't get as much credit
[03:05:02.900 --> 03:05:06.620]   as I think he deserves for that, and for Eddie Alvarez,
[03:05:06.620 --> 03:05:08.780]   and all the fights, for some reason,
[03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:12.620]   whenever Conor McGregor beats somebody,
[03:05:12.620 --> 03:05:16.060]   well, they were not that good then.
[03:05:16.060 --> 03:05:19.260]   Like, it means like they were, something was off.
[03:05:19.260 --> 03:05:20.860]   - Right, that's convenient, isn't it?
[03:05:20.860 --> 03:05:23.500]   - Yeah, it's quite strange to me.
[03:05:23.500 --> 03:05:26.500]   But I mean, what are your thoughts on Conor McGregor?
[03:05:26.500 --> 03:05:30.980]   Maybe one way to ask that, I'm Russian,
[03:05:30.980 --> 03:05:33.260]   so I'm obviously also a Khabib fan,
[03:05:33.260 --> 03:05:34.620]   but I'm also a Conor fan.
[03:05:34.620 --> 03:05:36.020]   It seems like there's not many of us
[03:05:36.020 --> 03:05:37.180]   who are like fans of both.
[03:05:37.180 --> 03:05:38.300]   - Right.
[03:05:38.300 --> 03:05:39.140]   - What are your thoughts?
[03:05:39.140 --> 03:05:40.260]   - You and Artem Lobov.
[03:05:40.260 --> 03:05:41.100]   (Lex laughing)
[03:05:41.100 --> 03:05:41.920]   - Yeah, right?
[03:05:41.920 --> 03:05:42.760]   - Exactly.
[03:05:42.760 --> 03:05:43.900]   - The two of us, which also is a good fight.
[03:05:43.900 --> 03:05:46.220]   - Tough dude.
[03:05:46.220 --> 03:05:48.020]   - Yeah, really, really tough dude.
[03:05:48.020 --> 03:05:49.780]   - He speaks like five languages, really interesting cat.
[03:05:49.780 --> 03:05:52.180]   - Also, oh, wow, I didn't know that side of it.
[03:05:52.180 --> 03:05:53.260]   There's a brain there.
[03:05:53.260 --> 03:05:56.180]   Well, on the Khabib versus Conor,
[03:05:56.180 --> 03:05:57.940]   what do you make of their first fight?
[03:05:57.940 --> 03:05:59.260]   What do you, do you agree with me
[03:05:59.260 --> 03:06:01.060]   that they should fight again?
[03:06:01.060 --> 03:06:02.620]   'Cause I think it'd be awesome
[03:06:02.620 --> 03:06:04.900]   if they fought again in Moscow.
[03:06:04.900 --> 03:06:07.100]   And do you agree with me,
[03:06:07.100 --> 03:06:09.880]   I'm just gonna say things that piss people off,
[03:06:09.880 --> 03:06:11.940]   but I believe, is that Conor actually
[03:06:11.940 --> 03:06:13.860]   has a chance to beat Khabib.
[03:06:13.860 --> 03:06:16.260]   - One, Conor absolutely has a chance to beat Khabib.
[03:06:16.260 --> 03:06:17.500]   Conor has a chance to beat anyone
[03:06:17.500 --> 03:06:18.580]   that he steps into that ring with,
[03:06:18.580 --> 03:06:20.100]   and not just like a mathematical chance.
[03:06:20.100 --> 03:06:21.180]   You're like, oh, one of the billion,
[03:06:21.180 --> 03:06:23.820]   but like, you know, he absolutely,
[03:06:23.820 --> 03:06:26.100]   it's funny 'cause I won't pretend to know Conor really well,
[03:06:26.100 --> 03:06:27.740]   but I first met Conor in 2010
[03:06:27.740 --> 03:06:28.900]   when I was teaching a seminar
[03:06:28.900 --> 03:06:31.620]   in at Straight Blast Gym Ireland in Dublin.
[03:06:31.620 --> 03:06:33.740]   And that's actually where I first met
[03:06:33.740 --> 03:06:36.660]   all of the coaches that ended up being on Conor's team.
[03:06:36.660 --> 03:06:40.740]   You know, John Kavanaugh, Owen Roddy, Gunnar Nielsen,
[03:06:40.740 --> 03:06:42.180]   you know, so for, I actually,
[03:06:42.180 --> 03:06:43.740]   I enjoyed being on Ultimate Fighter
[03:06:43.740 --> 03:06:45.700]   and being on Uriah Faber's team
[03:06:45.700 --> 03:06:47.060]   and getting to train with all the guys there.
[03:06:47.060 --> 03:06:49.060]   But at the same time, the people that I was actually,
[03:06:49.060 --> 03:06:50.980]   I knew better were actually the European side,
[03:06:50.980 --> 03:06:53.060]   all of Conor's coaches.
[03:06:53.060 --> 03:06:55.880]   And that was a neat thing
[03:06:55.880 --> 03:06:57.620]   because I got to, I met Conor.
[03:06:57.620 --> 03:06:58.940]   I didn't know who Conor,
[03:06:58.940 --> 03:07:00.140]   Conor wasn't Conor at that point.
[03:07:00.140 --> 03:07:01.860]   - Yeah, that was before his UFC debut.
[03:07:01.860 --> 03:07:03.060]   - Oh yeah, well before, yeah.
[03:07:03.060 --> 03:07:05.900]   I think he got in like 2014, maybe something like that.
[03:07:05.900 --> 03:07:09.020]   Yeah, and anyway, but he was doing well in Cage Warriors,
[03:07:09.020 --> 03:07:11.100]   winning the titles there, I think prior to that.
[03:07:11.100 --> 03:07:13.420]   You know, I remember going, seeing him on the show
[03:07:13.420 --> 03:07:15.900]   and also then getting to see him train
[03:07:15.900 --> 03:07:19.020]   'cause I competed, I was initially slated
[03:07:19.020 --> 03:07:21.340]   to fight David Tamer for the Ultimate Fighter finale
[03:07:21.340 --> 03:07:22.940]   before getting put in to fight Artem
[03:07:22.940 --> 03:07:24.660]   for the title for the show.
[03:07:24.660 --> 03:07:26.800]   So I went over to Ireland to train for a couple of days
[03:07:26.800 --> 03:07:29.560]   and basically it was neat to watch him, watch him work.
[03:07:29.560 --> 03:07:32.200]   I mean, man is focused and trains a lot
[03:07:32.200 --> 03:07:34.740]   and is very, very smart and very, very hardworking.
[03:07:34.740 --> 03:07:38.400]   And I think a lot of times people get stuck in this,
[03:07:38.400 --> 03:07:43.400]   and they almost wanna believe that this was lucky
[03:07:43.400 --> 03:07:45.400]   or that this person, you know,
[03:07:45.400 --> 03:07:47.040]   they're not working that hard, they're just out there.
[03:07:47.040 --> 03:07:48.880]   They got there with their mouth
[03:07:48.880 --> 03:07:50.760]   and that's just not the case.
[03:07:50.760 --> 03:07:52.640]   And, you know, I don't know what it's like.
[03:07:52.640 --> 03:07:54.520]   You know, obviously Conor's very well off right now
[03:07:54.520 --> 03:07:56.320]   and I don't know how hard, how serious he's training,
[03:07:56.320 --> 03:07:57.880]   what he's doing, I can't speak to any of that.
[03:07:57.880 --> 03:08:01.280]   But there's no question that he has skills to be dangerous.
[03:08:01.280 --> 03:08:02.680]   And one of the funny things, obviously,
[03:08:02.680 --> 03:08:03.880]   the Khabib fight went Khabib's way.
[03:08:03.880 --> 03:08:06.080]   Khabib was a great fighter and also has the chance
[03:08:06.080 --> 03:08:08.720]   to beat anyone in that ring at any given time.
[03:08:08.720 --> 03:08:13.720]   But there was, Conor, you know, it's one,
[03:08:13.720 --> 03:08:16.240]   he can put anybody away.
[03:08:16.240 --> 03:08:18.640]   And as you mentioned, I think that he doesn't get the credit
[03:08:18.640 --> 03:08:19.600]   for the Eddie Alvarez fight.
[03:08:19.600 --> 03:08:20.960]   He doesn't get the credit for the Jose Aldo fight
[03:08:20.960 --> 03:08:22.260]   'cause it was almost so much of a letdown.
[03:08:22.260 --> 03:08:23.580]   I remember that happened the same weekend
[03:08:23.580 --> 03:08:25.520]   at the Ultimate Fighter finale.
[03:08:25.520 --> 03:08:27.280]   And you're like, oh, wait, what?
[03:08:27.280 --> 03:08:28.920]   (laughing)
[03:08:28.920 --> 03:08:29.760]   Yeah.
[03:08:29.760 --> 03:08:30.840]   It almost doesn't feel like a fight happened.
[03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:32.480]   But we mentioned Miyamoto Musashi.
[03:08:32.480 --> 03:08:34.880]   I mean, Musashi was famous for the way he poked
[03:08:34.880 --> 03:08:36.620]   and prodded at people with what he was doing,
[03:08:36.620 --> 03:08:37.640]   whether overtly or not.
[03:08:37.640 --> 03:08:39.520]   It's like, oh, we're supposed to fight to the death
[03:08:39.520 --> 03:08:41.840]   and, you know, at 3 p.m. tomorrow, great.
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:43.800]   (sighing)
[03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:45.680]   4 p.m. rolls around, I'm just not there.
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:48.200]   Five, I mean, you remember all the antics and nonsense
[03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:49.520]   that Conor was pulling prior to that.
[03:08:49.520 --> 03:08:51.320]   Like, speaking personally, that's not,
[03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:52.880]   it's not something I would feel comfortable doing,
[03:08:52.880 --> 03:08:54.260]   but it's like, everyone's different.
[03:08:54.260 --> 03:08:56.460]   And the effect that it had on Jose was,
[03:08:56.460 --> 03:08:57.500]   I mean, beyond evident.
[03:08:57.500 --> 03:08:59.820]   When was the last time Jose started the fight
[03:08:59.820 --> 03:09:02.260]   with leaping left hand, leaping right hand?
[03:09:02.260 --> 03:09:03.500]   You're like, wait, what?
[03:09:03.500 --> 03:09:06.140]   And then he was obviously, you know,
[03:09:06.140 --> 03:09:08.740]   living rent-free in Jose's head at that point.
[03:09:08.740 --> 03:09:12.060]   And that was a combination of psychological, you know,
[03:09:12.060 --> 03:09:14.820]   ability and wherewithal and then physical.
[03:09:14.820 --> 03:09:16.500]   And it reminded me of the way Muhammad Ali
[03:09:16.500 --> 03:09:18.020]   would bother people and whatnot.
[03:09:18.020 --> 03:09:21.880]   And the fact that he's a polarizing figure,
[03:09:21.880 --> 03:09:24.220]   I think makes some people not give him his due.
[03:09:24.220 --> 03:09:25.340]   And then at the same time,
[03:09:25.340 --> 03:09:28.260]   sometimes certain fans maybe go overboard.
[03:09:28.260 --> 03:09:30.940]   But they remember the knee that Ben Askren
[03:09:30.940 --> 03:09:32.620]   got knocked out with by Masvidal.
[03:09:32.620 --> 03:09:34.460]   I mean, that was an amazing, unbelievable thing,
[03:09:34.460 --> 03:09:36.980]   but three inches to the right, three inches to the left,
[03:09:36.980 --> 03:09:38.540]   I guess, whichever side his head wasn't.
[03:09:38.540 --> 03:09:40.420]   Now, you know, could have been square,
[03:09:40.420 --> 03:09:43.380]   but, and that fight starts with Ben Askren
[03:09:43.380 --> 03:09:45.860]   on top of you in the first five seconds.
[03:09:45.860 --> 03:09:48.460]   Well, Conor ran him through a knee just like that
[03:09:48.460 --> 03:09:50.860]   at Khabib, and Khabib got right around it.
[03:09:50.860 --> 03:09:52.060]   That could have easily gone the other way.
[03:09:52.060 --> 03:09:53.400]   Can you imagine what would have happened
[03:09:53.400 --> 03:09:56.160]   if after coming back from boxing,
[03:09:56.160 --> 03:09:58.160]   after coming back from the Mayweather fight,
[03:09:58.160 --> 03:09:59.480]   Conor rocks Khabib.
[03:09:59.480 --> 03:10:01.000]   In the first 10 seconds it's over,
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:05.520]   and you're like, he would, it would have been intolerable.
[03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:08.000]   But basically, like, you know.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:08.840]   But see, here's the thing.
[03:10:08.840 --> 03:10:10.880]   Let me actually push back slightly.
[03:10:10.880 --> 03:10:15.440]   I mean, to the fans, correct me if I'm wrong,
[03:10:15.440 --> 03:10:19.240]   but Conor seems to, 'cause I've competed a lot,
[03:10:19.240 --> 03:10:21.980]   and like, there's a tension, there's a negativity sometimes
[03:10:21.980 --> 03:10:23.500]   depending on the opponent,
[03:10:23.500 --> 03:10:26.860]   and there's a respect afterwards that happens.
[03:10:26.860 --> 03:10:29.700]   Like, when you understand that there's a deep, like,
[03:10:29.700 --> 03:10:32.500]   respect and almost like a love for each other.
[03:10:32.500 --> 03:10:34.780]   Like, I've always seen that in Conor.
[03:10:34.780 --> 03:10:37.660]   Like, all the trash talk afterwards,
[03:10:37.660 --> 03:10:39.620]   there's a, it's a subtle thing.
[03:10:39.620 --> 03:10:42.180]   You can't always see it, but there's a respect.
[03:10:42.180 --> 03:10:43.020]   - I agree.
[03:10:43.020 --> 03:10:47.580]   - And like, I almost, on the Khabib side,
[03:10:47.580 --> 03:10:51.460]   I almost feel like Khabib really took it personally.
[03:10:51.460 --> 03:10:54.380]   He didn't, he lost the respect for Conor.
[03:10:54.380 --> 03:10:56.600]   I thought the whole time Conor had the respect.
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:10:58.380]   So, what I wanted to say is like,
[03:10:58.380 --> 03:11:01.080]   if Conor won that fight, like rock Khabib,
[03:11:01.080 --> 03:11:04.660]   I could see, like, I wouldn't see trash talking.
[03:11:04.660 --> 03:11:06.980]   I could see, like, trash talking stop right there.
[03:11:06.980 --> 03:11:08.660]   - I think so too, but at the same time,
[03:11:08.660 --> 03:11:10.780]   I'm sure you recall, like, Conor crossed
[03:11:10.780 --> 03:11:12.900]   in some pretty personal territory,
[03:11:12.900 --> 03:11:15.740]   both religiously and also familiarly with Khabib.
[03:11:15.740 --> 03:11:18.540]   And it's, you know, I mean, I think it's the sort of thing
[03:11:18.540 --> 03:11:20.740]   that, I don't know, it's an interesting,
[03:11:20.740 --> 03:11:21.580]   that's one of the reasons.
[03:11:21.580 --> 03:11:23.300]   - It depends, like, you have to know the difference.
[03:11:23.300 --> 03:11:28.300]   So, obviously, I know the Khabib, the Dagestani people,
[03:11:28.300 --> 03:11:29.420]   they don't--
[03:11:29.420 --> 03:11:30.260]   - Play around like that.
[03:11:30.260 --> 03:11:32.060]   - They don't play around like that.
[03:11:32.060 --> 03:11:34.500]   You know, I mean, they take offense to basically,
[03:11:34.500 --> 03:11:36.180]   I mean, you don't do that.
[03:11:36.180 --> 03:11:41.180]   So, like, Conor didn't, maybe he did it on purpose,
[03:11:41.180 --> 03:11:43.500]   or maybe he wasn't even just aware of--
[03:11:43.500 --> 03:11:44.340]   - Totally fair.
[03:11:44.340 --> 03:11:45.180]   - Of--
[03:11:45.180 --> 03:11:46.020]   - It was cultural differences, you know?
[03:11:46.020 --> 03:11:47.740]   - Of the box he opened.
[03:11:47.740 --> 03:11:50.860]   Like, you can talk to Floyd Mayweather,
[03:11:50.860 --> 03:11:52.620]   you can go anywhere with him.
[03:11:52.620 --> 03:11:54.460]   You can say the most offensive things,
[03:11:54.460 --> 03:11:57.660]   but with Khabib--
[03:11:57.660 --> 03:11:58.500]   - There's hard lines.
[03:11:58.500 --> 03:11:59.620]   - Yeah, hard lines.
[03:11:59.620 --> 03:12:02.540]   But you, I mean, a lot of people ask,
[03:12:02.540 --> 03:12:03.500]   I know you're a featherweight,
[03:12:03.500 --> 03:12:08.500]   but if you were to face,
[03:12:08.500 --> 03:12:11.500]   it feels like Khabib was one of the hardest puzzles to solve
[03:12:11.500 --> 03:12:14.060]   in all of mixed martial arts.
[03:12:14.060 --> 03:12:15.660]   If you were to face Khabib,
[03:12:15.660 --> 03:12:19.940]   do you think, how would you go about solving that puzzle?
[03:12:19.940 --> 03:12:21.500]   Like, almost, the question is almost
[03:12:21.500 --> 03:12:23.640]   from a jiu-jitsu perspective, too.
[03:12:23.640 --> 03:12:26.620]   What do you do with a guy that's exceptionally good
[03:12:26.620 --> 03:12:29.300]   at controlling position, especially on top,
[03:12:29.300 --> 03:12:31.180]   very good at wrestling, taking down,
[03:12:31.180 --> 03:12:32.740]   and controlling position?
[03:12:32.740 --> 03:12:36.580]   Like, let's say, so forget maybe striking.
[03:12:36.580 --> 03:12:40.300]   On the ground, how do you solve that guy?
[03:12:40.300 --> 03:12:42.380]   Like, what do you do with your guard
[03:12:42.380 --> 03:12:43.340]   if you get taken down?
[03:12:43.340 --> 03:12:45.220]   Or do you create an entire system
[03:12:45.220 --> 03:12:47.140]   of not getting taken down or escaping?
[03:12:47.140 --> 03:12:49.500]   It's like, what ideas do you have for that?
[03:12:49.500 --> 03:12:50.980]   - Well, I guess I would say, in my mind,
[03:12:50.980 --> 03:12:52.940]   fighting is a game of trading energy.
[03:12:52.940 --> 03:12:56.700]   Kind of, there's two things.
[03:12:56.700 --> 03:12:58.140]   There's damage and there's energy.
[03:12:58.140 --> 03:13:01.580]   So, like, when I say energy, I mean like tired, not tired,
[03:13:01.580 --> 03:13:03.260]   how much gas you've got.
[03:13:03.260 --> 03:13:06.260]   And then damage counts, obviously, as well.
[03:13:06.260 --> 03:13:08.060]   You could be feeling, I could be feeling great,
[03:13:08.060 --> 03:13:09.100]   and then you get to kick me in the head
[03:13:09.100 --> 03:13:10.420]   hard, really hard, three times.
[03:13:10.420 --> 03:13:12.080]   It doesn't matter that I could get up and run a mile.
[03:13:12.080 --> 03:13:13.060]   I can't get up.
[03:13:13.060 --> 03:13:17.700]   So, anyway, I think what Khabib does so well
[03:13:17.700 --> 03:13:19.220]   is he makes the fight look like
[03:13:19.220 --> 03:13:20.940]   a Khabib and a Magomedov fight.
[03:13:20.940 --> 03:13:23.180]   He does a great job of avoiding damage
[03:13:23.180 --> 03:13:24.580]   on the feet, for the most part,
[03:13:24.580 --> 03:13:26.900]   and really sucking the life out of people
[03:13:26.900 --> 03:13:30.660]   with how suffocating and oppressive his control is.
[03:13:30.660 --> 03:13:32.380]   His chain wrestling is as good as anyone
[03:13:32.380 --> 03:13:33.700]   we've ever seen in the UFC.
[03:13:33.700 --> 03:13:35.540]   It's fantastic.
[03:13:35.540 --> 03:13:38.700]   But that poses a really serious threat for people
[03:13:38.700 --> 03:13:41.300]   that need to maintain a certain amount of space
[03:13:41.300 --> 03:13:42.380]   and try to hurt him on the feet,
[03:13:42.380 --> 03:13:44.380]   because unless they're able to inflict
[03:13:44.380 --> 03:13:46.180]   an adequate amount of damage,
[03:13:46.180 --> 03:13:48.300]   they're gonna, each time, let's say, for instance,
[03:13:48.300 --> 03:13:49.260]   let's say him taking them down
[03:13:49.260 --> 03:13:51.980]   as a foregone conclusion at some point.
[03:13:51.980 --> 03:13:53.900]   If every single time Khabib takes you down,
[03:13:53.900 --> 03:13:56.500]   you get right back up, it's not that big a deal,
[03:13:56.500 --> 03:13:58.580]   because it's actually more, we've all experienced this.
[03:13:58.580 --> 03:13:59.700]   Let's say you and I are rolling,
[03:13:59.700 --> 03:14:01.380]   you tap me 15 times in one round.
[03:14:01.380 --> 03:14:02.240]   Who's more tired?
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:03.980]   Probably you are.
[03:14:03.980 --> 03:14:04.800]   Yeah.
[03:14:04.800 --> 03:14:05.640]   You whoop my ass so badly
[03:14:05.640 --> 03:14:07.380]   that it's like you're the only one working.
[03:14:07.380 --> 03:14:08.820]   But--
[03:14:08.820 --> 03:14:11.740]   So, if you're comfortable with the up and down of it,
[03:14:11.740 --> 03:14:13.500]   like being taken down.
[03:14:13.500 --> 03:14:18.340]   If you don't get hurt badly or tired on the bottom,
[03:14:18.340 --> 03:14:19.860]   you have a chance.
[03:14:19.860 --> 03:14:22.300]   But that doesn't involve just cracking him on the feet
[03:14:22.300 --> 03:14:23.820]   before he gets a hold of you.
[03:14:23.820 --> 03:14:24.860]   That's a lot.
[03:14:24.860 --> 03:14:25.700]   That's a lot to ask.
[03:14:25.700 --> 03:14:26.520]   That's a lot to ask.
[03:14:26.520 --> 03:14:27.440]   That's difficult to do.
[03:14:27.440 --> 03:14:29.820]   It seemed actually like Conor,
[03:14:29.820 --> 03:14:32.620]   it seemed like it when he was being kind of taken down
[03:14:32.620 --> 03:14:35.300]   or the takedown attempts against Khabib.
[03:14:35.300 --> 03:14:38.060]   He seemed to be somewhat relaxed through the whole thing.
[03:14:38.060 --> 03:14:39.180]   I thought he was doing well, actually.
[03:14:39.180 --> 03:14:40.740]   I think that, particularly for the first round,
[03:14:40.740 --> 03:14:42.260]   I thought he did a very good job.
[03:14:42.260 --> 03:14:46.260]   It's just one of those things that I think like Khabib being,
[03:14:46.260 --> 03:14:49.500]   the fights taking place in Khabib's world in large part.
[03:14:49.500 --> 03:14:51.660]   And I mean, set aside that one giant,
[03:14:51.660 --> 03:14:54.140]   what is it, right hand that Khabib hit Conor with.
[03:14:54.140 --> 03:14:56.060]   By the way, Conor reacted like an absolute champion.
[03:14:56.060 --> 03:14:59.460]   He got crushed by that overhand and then dropped
[03:14:59.460 --> 03:15:01.380]   and his eyes went right back on Khabib.
[03:15:01.380 --> 03:15:03.540]   It was immediate positive, great response.
[03:15:03.540 --> 03:15:05.140]   So even though that was, I think,
[03:15:05.140 --> 03:15:06.420]   that was a bit of a surprising thing,
[03:15:06.420 --> 03:15:07.740]   Conor reacted really, really well.
[03:15:07.740 --> 03:15:10.220]   But if you're gonna be on bottom with Khabib
[03:15:10.220 --> 03:15:11.820]   for four rounds, that's gonna be tough.
[03:15:11.820 --> 03:15:13.500]   And also Conor's a way better grappler
[03:15:13.500 --> 03:15:15.540]   than people like to give him credit for,
[03:15:15.540 --> 03:15:17.940]   but he's not the type of grappler that can do,
[03:15:17.940 --> 03:15:20.340]   that can, that's too tall of an order.
[03:15:20.340 --> 03:15:22.300]   But there are grapplers that could do that,
[03:15:22.300 --> 03:15:24.100]   or at least would have a much, much better shot
[03:15:24.100 --> 03:15:26.860]   at being able to weather that type of a storm.
[03:15:26.860 --> 03:15:28.740]   Do you see yourself being able to be relaxed
[03:15:28.740 --> 03:15:29.780]   through that kind of storm?
[03:15:29.780 --> 03:15:30.620]   Yes.
[03:15:30.620 --> 03:15:33.180]   Well, I guess.
[03:15:33.180 --> 03:15:35.500]   (laughing)
[03:15:35.500 --> 03:15:39.060]   Remember, being savagely beaten is very relaxing.
[03:15:39.060 --> 03:15:42.540]   The timing of that answer was like, okay.
[03:15:42.540 --> 03:15:44.940]   That's a dumb question.
[03:15:44.940 --> 03:15:45.780]   No.
[03:15:45.780 --> 03:15:49.020]   That's ultimately the goal of jujitsu
[03:15:49.020 --> 03:15:51.780]   is to be relaxed through the fire.
[03:15:51.780 --> 03:15:53.660]   For sure, and remember, like every UFC fighter,
[03:15:53.660 --> 03:15:55.340]   I win all hypothetical matchups.
[03:15:55.340 --> 03:15:56.180]   Yeah, for sure.
[03:15:56.180 --> 03:15:58.260]   (laughing)
[03:15:58.260 --> 03:15:59.100]   That's true.
[03:15:59.100 --> 03:16:03.820]   Since I'm one to ask ridiculous questions,
[03:16:03.820 --> 03:16:05.980]   and we've been talking about sci-fi
[03:16:05.980 --> 03:16:07.060]   and all that kind of stuff,
[03:16:07.060 --> 03:16:08.780]   let me ask the kind of big question
[03:16:08.780 --> 03:16:11.780]   that everybody disagrees about, certainly with me,
[03:16:11.780 --> 03:16:15.860]   is who are the top five greatest MMA fighters of all time?
[03:16:15.860 --> 03:16:16.700]   Oh, man.
[03:16:16.700 --> 03:16:19.340]   And why is Fedor number one?
[03:16:19.340 --> 03:16:21.380]   Okay, well, first off, Fedor is number one.
[03:16:21.380 --> 03:16:22.220]   Oh, really?
[03:16:22.220 --> 03:16:23.060]   Oh, yeah.
[03:16:23.060 --> 03:16:23.880]   I agree right there with you.
[03:16:23.880 --> 03:16:24.720]   Really?
[03:16:24.720 --> 03:16:25.560]   Oh, yeah.
[03:16:25.560 --> 03:16:27.300]   Talk about people that just get completely underappreciated.
[03:16:27.300 --> 03:16:28.700]   Even though he's never been in the,
[03:16:28.700 --> 03:16:31.140]   like he's never succeeded in the UFC?
[03:16:31.140 --> 03:16:32.780]   It's not his fault it came along after him.
[03:16:32.780 --> 03:16:35.420]   At the time that Fedor was at his height,
[03:16:35.420 --> 03:16:38.620]   the UFC was not where it was at for heavyweight fighting.
[03:16:38.620 --> 03:16:40.140]   I mean, not that there weren't good heavyweights there,
[03:16:40.140 --> 03:16:42.740]   but Fedor was unbelievable.
[03:16:42.740 --> 03:16:43.700]   You know, I mean, you remember,
[03:16:43.700 --> 03:16:47.340]   I mean, Minotauro Noguera, I was a massive fan of him.
[03:16:47.340 --> 03:16:50.340]   I still remember watching, what is it, Pride 2004,
[03:16:50.340 --> 03:16:52.100]   when Noguera fought Crow Cop
[03:16:52.100 --> 03:16:54.120]   and got blasted with that left kick
[03:16:54.120 --> 03:16:56.580]   and dropped with like seconds left in the first round.
[03:16:56.580 --> 03:16:58.140]   Pride was great 'cause it had a 10-minute first round
[03:16:58.140 --> 03:16:59.300]   and that five-minute second,
[03:16:59.300 --> 03:17:02.220]   which again, materially alters the fight big time.
[03:17:02.220 --> 03:17:03.540]   And you know, just the texture of the fight,
[03:17:03.540 --> 03:17:05.420]   'cause it's totally, it's borderline a different sport,
[03:17:05.420 --> 03:17:08.500]   you know, than getting a five, a pause and a five.
[03:17:08.500 --> 03:17:10.940]   But anyway, similar sports,
[03:17:10.940 --> 03:17:11.780]   like one of those swimming things
[03:17:11.780 --> 03:17:12.740]   where they have nine gold medals
[03:17:12.740 --> 03:17:14.140]   for different types of swimming, right?
[03:17:14.140 --> 03:17:15.700]   But still swimming, but anyway.
[03:17:15.700 --> 03:17:19.260]   - Well, yeah, they would disagree.
[03:17:19.260 --> 03:17:20.100]   - Yeah, I don't mean, I'm not trying to--
[03:17:20.100 --> 03:17:22.580]   - They specialize in the, but it's totally true.
[03:17:22.580 --> 03:17:24.220]   10 minutes is different than five minutes.
[03:17:24.220 --> 03:17:27.220]   - Sorry, I'll take, don't drown me, swimmers.
[03:17:27.220 --> 03:17:28.300]   I don't swim very well.
[03:17:28.300 --> 03:17:30.140]   It's easy for me to downplay it.
[03:17:30.140 --> 03:17:33.180]   But anyway, yeah, and then--
[03:17:33.180 --> 03:17:36.380]   - So better than Jon Jones, like the modern era.
[03:17:36.380 --> 03:17:39.780]   - Well, I mean, I guess it's tough to compare across eras.
[03:17:39.780 --> 03:17:41.580]   It would be like going and saying like,
[03:17:41.580 --> 03:17:45.460]   oh man, how would such and such great grappler from today
[03:17:45.460 --> 03:17:47.980]   fare against someone from 1995?
[03:17:47.980 --> 03:17:50.420]   I'm like, well, probably pretty well for them,
[03:17:50.420 --> 03:17:53.740]   depending upon who they are, what's going on.
[03:17:53.740 --> 03:17:54.820]   You know, there's some people that would,
[03:17:54.820 --> 03:17:56.760]   their skill sets might transition across eras,
[03:17:56.760 --> 03:17:58.940]   but a lot of times not, but that's not fair.
[03:17:58.940 --> 03:18:01.140]   We get the, they'll be like comparing Spartans
[03:18:01.140 --> 03:18:04.220]   to modern day, you know, like army guys.
[03:18:04.220 --> 03:18:05.140]   You're like, well, who's gonna win?
[03:18:05.140 --> 03:18:06.500]   I'm like, well, did modern day army guys
[03:18:06.500 --> 03:18:07.460]   get modern day weapons?
[03:18:07.460 --> 03:18:09.820]   Well, yeah, but who's the toughest,
[03:18:09.820 --> 03:18:11.820]   ruggedest group of people at the very least?
[03:18:11.820 --> 03:18:13.700]   So I guess it's tough to say, but at least in my mind,
[03:18:13.700 --> 03:18:15.860]   the people that I think about for great fighters,
[03:18:15.860 --> 03:18:20.860]   their quality of opposition, their level of like lasting,
[03:18:20.860 --> 03:18:23.420]   like success, their level of lasting innovation,
[03:18:23.420 --> 03:18:25.460]   like the courage that they have to demonstrate.
[03:18:25.460 --> 03:18:27.020]   Because again, it's like being a big fish
[03:18:27.020 --> 03:18:28.460]   in a small pond takes no courage.
[03:18:28.460 --> 03:18:30.140]   Doesn't mean that there's nothing there,
[03:18:30.140 --> 03:18:32.460]   but it just requires something a little bit different.
[03:18:32.460 --> 03:18:35.100]   So Kazushi Sakuraba is one of my guys too.
[03:18:35.100 --> 03:18:39.020]   BJ Penn also, I mean, BJ Penn fought Lyoto Machida.
[03:18:39.020 --> 03:18:40.260]   That's insane.
[03:18:40.260 --> 03:18:42.780]   You know, it's, that was a time, it was a different sport.
[03:18:42.780 --> 03:18:44.460]   It was a different time in the sport where, you know,
[03:18:44.460 --> 03:18:46.260]   they were, some guys were bouncing around
[03:18:46.260 --> 03:18:48.020]   doing different things, but let's,
[03:18:48.020 --> 03:18:50.660]   so I guess the Gracie family, it's, I mean,
[03:18:50.660 --> 03:18:53.980]   they never had an, like obviously hoist was there,
[03:18:53.980 --> 03:18:55.500]   but they never, and that was a definitely
[03:18:55.500 --> 03:18:57.380]   a different sport, weight classes being open,
[03:18:57.380 --> 03:18:58.220]   things like that.
[03:18:58.220 --> 03:18:59.820]   Yeah, but you have to say that hoist is up there.
[03:18:59.820 --> 03:19:00.660]   Oh, no question.
[03:19:00.660 --> 03:19:01.500]   One of the greatest ever.
[03:19:01.500 --> 03:19:02.380]   I think so too.
[03:19:02.380 --> 03:19:04.980]   And again, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you,
[03:19:04.980 --> 03:19:06.540]   if it weren't for him.
[03:19:06.540 --> 03:19:08.980]   So the Gracie family as a whole, but I mean,
[03:19:08.980 --> 03:19:12.220]   who's the better, I mean, I think hoist would tell you
[03:19:12.220 --> 03:19:14.460]   himself probably that Hickson would have handled business
[03:19:14.460 --> 03:19:16.140]   back then, but they didn't put him in.
[03:19:16.140 --> 03:19:18.260]   So again, he's the greatest fighter, the greatest fighter,
[03:19:18.260 --> 03:19:19.900]   the greatest fighter that we saw do his business.
[03:19:19.900 --> 03:19:21.340]   So hoist up there for sure.
[03:19:21.340 --> 03:19:23.500]   What about, so this is like,
[03:19:23.500 --> 03:19:25.140]   nobody seems to agree with me on this,
[03:19:25.140 --> 03:19:28.140]   but like this connects to soccer again and Messi.
[03:19:28.140 --> 03:19:31.860]   It seems that people value like how long
[03:19:31.860 --> 03:19:33.740]   you've been a champion, how many,
[03:19:34.620 --> 03:19:38.180]   like defenses of the championship that you've had
[03:19:38.180 --> 03:19:41.780]   successfully, to me, I highly value
[03:19:41.780 --> 03:19:43.660]   singular moments of genius.
[03:19:43.660 --> 03:19:47.780]   So like, I don't, like if you look at Conor McGregor,
[03:19:47.780 --> 03:19:50.740]   he hasn't, I guess, held, been a champion
[03:19:50.740 --> 03:19:51.700]   very long, very much.
[03:19:51.700 --> 03:19:53.020]   Well, he didn't defend either title, right?
[03:19:53.020 --> 03:19:56.220]   He didn't defend any other, either of the titles,
[03:19:56.220 --> 03:19:59.020]   but like, if you took, and same with Messi,
[03:19:59.020 --> 03:20:01.820]   if you look at Lionel Messi,
[03:20:01.820 --> 03:20:03.980]   there's just moments of brilliance,
[03:20:03.980 --> 03:20:07.540]   unlike any other in history for both Conor and Messi.
[03:20:07.540 --> 03:20:08.780]   And people don't seem to give credits,
[03:20:08.780 --> 03:20:10.980]   like, well, how many World Cups have you won?
[03:20:10.980 --> 03:20:13.740]   But to me, like, why is it about this arbitrary
[03:20:13.740 --> 03:20:15.780]   World Cup thing or championship thing?
[03:20:15.780 --> 03:20:16.660]   - I think it's easier for people
[03:20:16.660 --> 03:20:17.500]   to wrap their head around, right?
[03:20:17.500 --> 03:20:18.980]   It's like the NFL combine.
[03:20:18.980 --> 03:20:20.340]   When was, I mean, - Numbers.
[03:20:20.340 --> 03:20:21.500]   - Yeah, numbers, it's something,
[03:20:21.500 --> 03:20:23.540]   well, again, if I go and if I pick Tom Brady
[03:20:23.540 --> 03:20:26.740]   in the first round, you know, and it works out,
[03:20:26.740 --> 03:20:27.740]   they call me a genius.
[03:20:27.740 --> 03:20:29.740]   If I pick Tom Brady in the first round
[03:20:29.740 --> 03:20:31.620]   after his combine and it doesn't work out,
[03:20:31.620 --> 03:20:32.980]   I get fired and I'm never hired again,
[03:20:32.980 --> 03:20:34.580]   I have to work somewhere else.
[03:20:34.580 --> 03:20:37.540]   But it's like, I'm insulating myself from criticism,
[03:20:37.540 --> 03:20:39.420]   I think, almost, if I go by the numbers.
[03:20:39.420 --> 03:20:40.660]   Well, he had more bench presses.
[03:20:40.660 --> 03:20:42.820]   It's like, how many times have the guys
[03:20:42.820 --> 03:20:46.500]   that are like the super studs in the NFL combine
[03:20:46.500 --> 03:20:49.220]   ever been on the greatest players in the NFL history,
[03:20:49.220 --> 03:20:50.060]   in NFL history?
[03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:51.900]   Like, zero or close to zero?
[03:20:51.900 --> 03:20:53.660]   And even if there's some,
[03:20:53.660 --> 03:20:55.900]   it's certainly not a one-to-one correlation.
[03:20:55.900 --> 03:20:57.040]   So it's so funny, though.
[03:20:57.040 --> 03:20:58.140]   I think it's just like, how many,
[03:20:58.140 --> 03:20:59.940]   how long, how many days did he hold the title?
[03:20:59.940 --> 03:21:02.540]   Oh, your title reign was X times longer.
[03:21:02.540 --> 03:21:03.380]   That means nothing.
[03:21:03.380 --> 03:21:05.020]   So if we wanna define greatest fighter ever,
[03:21:05.020 --> 03:21:07.260]   like you said, I think individual moments of like,
[03:21:07.260 --> 03:21:09.200]   that was transcendent, that was different,
[03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:10.420]   that was something else.
[03:21:10.420 --> 03:21:11.540]   Because people can win or lose
[03:21:11.540 --> 03:21:12.820]   for any number of different reasons.
[03:21:12.820 --> 03:21:14.620]   And that's an interesting thing.
[03:21:14.620 --> 03:21:16.500]   Again, I don't blame Argentina
[03:21:16.500 --> 03:21:18.700]   not winning the World Cup on Messi.
[03:21:18.700 --> 03:21:20.640]   You know, that's not fair.
[03:21:20.640 --> 03:21:22.660]   You know, how many times has, I mean,
[03:21:22.660 --> 03:21:25.800]   I remember when Trent Dilfer was the quarterback
[03:21:25.800 --> 03:21:27.980]   for the Baltimore Ravens.
[03:21:27.980 --> 03:21:29.340]   And they had such a strong defense.
[03:21:29.340 --> 03:21:30.320]   I'm not trying to pick on Trent Dilfer,
[03:21:30.320 --> 03:21:32.560]   but it's like, they had such a strong defense
[03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:33.680]   that they were able to make it.
[03:21:33.680 --> 03:21:35.480]   That was the Ray Lewis, you know,
[03:21:35.480 --> 03:21:37.360]   Chris McAllister era, you know,
[03:21:37.360 --> 03:21:39.880]   and they won the Super Bowl.
[03:21:39.880 --> 03:21:42.960]   I don't think anyone is going to say that,
[03:21:42.960 --> 03:21:45.880]   you know, Trent Dilfer's a better quarterback than,
[03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:48.500]   you know, or put him in the same category as Dan Marino.
[03:21:48.500 --> 03:21:51.680]   But he got the W, he's got the Super Ring.
[03:21:51.680 --> 03:21:53.440]   How many times, let's use March Madness,
[03:21:53.440 --> 03:21:54.280]   or Super Bowl, I love it.
[03:21:54.280 --> 03:21:55.840]   Like, that guy always makes the finals,
[03:21:55.840 --> 03:21:57.720]   but he just never gets it done.
[03:21:57.720 --> 03:21:58.620]   So let me get this straight.
[03:21:58.620 --> 03:22:00.680]   Getting to the finals nine times doesn't count
[03:22:00.680 --> 03:22:02.440]   because you didn't win the end game.
[03:22:02.440 --> 03:22:03.900]   I'm not saying it wouldn't be better,
[03:22:03.900 --> 03:22:05.100]   but that guy won the game once.
[03:22:05.100 --> 03:22:06.040]   He got over the hump.
[03:22:06.040 --> 03:22:07.360]   Well, how many other times was he in the finals?
[03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:08.200]   Zero?
[03:22:08.200 --> 03:22:09.720]   You're like, all right.
[03:22:09.720 --> 03:22:11.360]   - It's interesting what we, yeah,
[03:22:11.360 --> 03:22:13.440]   that we were obsessed with these numbers.
[03:22:13.440 --> 03:22:16.760]   - Well, 'cause we can't assess their method, right?
[03:22:16.760 --> 03:22:17.800]   I think most of the time,
[03:22:17.800 --> 03:22:19.760]   most of us can't assess the method of anything.
[03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:21.840]   I mean, it's like, oh, look at that guy do X, Y swimming.
[03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:23.720]   I'm like, how do I know Michael Phelps is great?
[03:22:23.720 --> 03:22:25.120]   I don't know, he was faster?
[03:22:25.120 --> 03:22:27.000]   I can't look at his technique and say anything
[03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:28.980]   other than, well, that's way better than anything
[03:22:28.980 --> 03:22:30.900]   I know how to do, but I can't say the difference
[03:22:30.900 --> 03:22:32.780]   between him and the next guy.
[03:22:32.780 --> 03:22:34.620]   So I guess that's, I wonder if it's like,
[03:22:34.620 --> 03:22:36.100]   I need a concrete identifier.
[03:22:36.100 --> 03:22:38.300]   And a lot of times people don't like saying, I don't know.
[03:22:38.300 --> 03:22:40.460]   - And most people won't put like a Ronda Rousey
[03:22:40.460 --> 03:22:43.020]   in the top even 20 or 50 of,
[03:22:43.020 --> 03:22:47.660]   but like she changed more than almost anybody else.
[03:22:47.660 --> 03:22:52.100]   She changed the martial arts history.
[03:22:52.100 --> 03:22:53.380]   I don't know if that even,
[03:22:53.380 --> 03:22:55.300]   I don't think I'm exaggerating that.
[03:22:55.300 --> 03:23:00.300]   She made it okay for women to be fighters
[03:23:00.300 --> 03:23:05.600]   and like changed the way we see,
[03:23:05.600 --> 03:23:08.100]   like she's one of the great feminists of our time.
[03:23:08.100 --> 03:23:08.940]   (laughing)
[03:23:08.940 --> 03:23:10.460]   - In her own way, yeah.
[03:23:10.460 --> 03:23:13.720]   - In a weird kind of way that like, I don't know,
[03:23:13.720 --> 03:23:17.700]   maybe I'm just a Ronda Rousey fan, but yeah.
[03:23:17.700 --> 03:23:19.060]   But she's not in the conversation
[03:23:19.060 --> 03:23:20.860]   'cause then you start converting into numbers.
[03:23:20.860 --> 03:23:22.140]   Well, how many did she actually win?
[03:23:22.140 --> 03:23:23.540]   - Is she among the greatest fighters
[03:23:23.540 --> 03:23:25.180]   or did she do the greatest things?
[03:23:25.180 --> 03:23:27.500]   I mean, I don't, I think it's something that,
[03:23:27.500 --> 03:23:29.460]   I mean, obviously Ronda is a great judoka
[03:23:29.460 --> 03:23:31.300]   who was competing in MMA at a time
[03:23:31.300 --> 03:23:32.580]   when a lot of the girls like,
[03:23:32.580 --> 03:23:33.740]   where did you get your skills?
[03:23:33.740 --> 03:23:34.580]   In the Olympics.
[03:23:34.580 --> 03:23:35.400]   Oh, where'd you get yours?
[03:23:35.400 --> 03:23:36.240]   High school.
[03:23:36.240 --> 03:23:37.060]   You're like, yeah, you're gonna,
[03:23:37.060 --> 03:23:38.100]   Olympic girls gonna beat you up.
[03:23:38.100 --> 03:23:41.060]   But I guess that that doesn't diminish her.
[03:23:41.060 --> 03:23:43.020]   Just that accomplishment is what it is.
[03:23:43.020 --> 03:23:44.260]   I don't have to, I don't,
[03:23:44.260 --> 03:23:47.700]   Fedor is not diminished by the fact that he would,
[03:23:47.700 --> 03:23:49.820]   like if he were to fight Stephen Miochis right now,
[03:23:49.820 --> 03:23:52.580]   it probably wouldn't go great or that Jon Jones exists.
[03:23:52.580 --> 03:23:55.220]   I don't now have to like knock Fedor's accomplishments down
[03:23:55.220 --> 03:23:57.180]   or say, oh, because BJ Penn or someone,
[03:23:57.180 --> 03:23:59.760]   so let's say has a mixed record at this point
[03:23:59.760 --> 03:24:01.300]   that somehow invalidates the things
[03:24:01.300 --> 03:24:02.740]   that they've done before.
[03:24:02.740 --> 03:24:04.060]   I guess it kind of brings us back
[03:24:04.060 --> 03:24:05.620]   to a lot of the other people we've talked about.
[03:24:05.620 --> 03:24:07.380]   The fact that the brilliant people
[03:24:07.380 --> 03:24:08.380]   throughout history that we love
[03:24:08.380 --> 03:24:09.620]   or some of the monsters throughout history
[03:24:09.620 --> 03:24:12.500]   that we rightly revile in a lot of cases
[03:24:12.500 --> 03:24:14.320]   were complicated people and their legacy
[03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:15.460]   is more than just one thing.
[03:24:15.460 --> 03:24:17.740]   And someone doing something amazing doesn't,
[03:24:17.740 --> 03:24:18.980]   doesn't mean they didn't do anything bad.
[03:24:18.980 --> 03:24:21.180]   And someone doing terrible things doesn't,
[03:24:21.180 --> 03:24:23.980]   doesn't mean that, doesn't invalidate the positives
[03:24:23.980 --> 03:24:24.800]   that they did.
[03:24:24.800 --> 03:24:26.380]   But I guess we're fighting the urge
[03:24:26.380 --> 03:24:29.660]   to put people in one category and same with ourselves.
[03:24:29.660 --> 03:24:31.140]   I think that's why people get depressed.
[03:24:31.140 --> 03:24:32.820]   Oh, I'm good right now.
[03:24:32.820 --> 03:24:33.980]   Oh, I'm bad right now.
[03:24:33.980 --> 03:24:35.580]   Versus hey, we're all a work in progress
[03:24:35.580 --> 03:24:37.360]   and we're trying to do X number of things
[03:24:37.360 --> 03:24:39.700]   and legacy is a tough thing to figure out anyway.
[03:24:39.700 --> 03:24:41.060]   And it's all speculative.
[03:24:41.060 --> 03:24:44.980]   - Last time or no, on Reddit, you said that,
[03:24:44.980 --> 03:24:48.620]   last time too, that you don't experience much fear
[03:24:48.620 --> 03:24:50.780]   before fights.
[03:24:50.780 --> 03:24:52.940]   I'd like to ask you a couple of Mike Tyson things
[03:24:52.940 --> 03:24:53.780]   if it's okay.
[03:24:53.780 --> 03:24:55.420]   It's just interesting to me, maybe I'm just weird.
[03:24:55.420 --> 03:24:58.260]   So there's a, I don't know if you've seen this clip
[03:24:58.260 --> 03:25:03.260]   of Tyson talking about how he feels leading up to a fight,
[03:25:03.260 --> 03:25:07.420]   that he's kind of overtaken with fear,
[03:25:07.420 --> 03:25:10.180]   but as he gets closer and closer and closer to the ring,
[03:25:10.180 --> 03:25:12.420]   his confidence grows.
[03:25:12.420 --> 03:25:15.420]   Have you seen the clip?
[03:25:15.420 --> 03:25:17.020]   - I'm aware of it, but I haven't seen it in a while.
[03:25:17.020 --> 03:25:19.420]   - Here, let me play it for you.
[03:25:19.420 --> 03:25:22.820]   George St. Pierre said something similar to me one time.
[03:25:22.820 --> 03:25:24.500]   - While I'm in the dressing room,
[03:25:24.500 --> 03:25:28.020]   five minutes before I come out, my gloves are laced up.
[03:25:28.020 --> 03:25:29.620]   I'm breaking my gloves down.
[03:25:29.620 --> 03:25:31.380]   I'm pushing the leather of the back of my leg
[03:25:31.380 --> 03:25:32.380]   in the middle of the gloves,
[03:25:32.380 --> 03:25:34.140]   so my knuckle could pierce through the leather,
[03:25:34.140 --> 03:25:36.820]   feel my knuckle piercing against the tight leather gloves
[03:25:36.820 --> 03:25:38.940]   on the Everlast boxing gloves.
[03:25:38.940 --> 03:25:40.700]   When I come out, I have supreme confidence.
[03:25:40.700 --> 03:25:42.380]   I'm scared to death.
[03:25:42.380 --> 03:25:43.500]   I'm totally afraid.
[03:25:43.500 --> 03:25:44.500]   I'm afraid of everything.
[03:25:44.500 --> 03:25:45.540]   I'm afraid of losing.
[03:25:45.540 --> 03:25:47.180]   I'm afraid of being humiliated,
[03:25:47.180 --> 03:25:48.420]   but I'm just totally confident.
[03:25:48.420 --> 03:25:51.140]   The closer I get to the ring, the more confidence I get.
[03:25:51.140 --> 03:25:52.820]   The closer, the more confidence I get.
[03:25:52.820 --> 03:25:54.860]   The closer, the more confidence I get.
[03:25:54.860 --> 03:25:57.140]   All during my training, I've been afraid of this man.
[03:25:57.140 --> 03:25:59.420]   I thought this man might be capable of beating me.
[03:25:59.420 --> 03:26:01.580]   I've dreamed of him beating me,
[03:26:01.580 --> 03:26:04.060]   but I always stayed afraid of him.
[03:26:04.060 --> 03:26:06.380]   But the closer I get to the ring, I'm more confident.
[03:26:06.380 --> 03:26:08.180]   Once I'm in the ring, I'm a god.
[03:26:08.180 --> 03:26:09.300]   No one can beat me.
[03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:10.500]   - I'm a god.
[03:26:10.500 --> 03:26:14.980]   I mean, first of all, he's cognizant of both his demons
[03:26:14.980 --> 03:26:17.620]   and whatever the hell ideas he has about violence.
[03:26:17.620 --> 03:26:18.660]   That's so interesting.
[03:26:18.660 --> 03:26:23.660]   Is there something about the tension that he's describing
[03:26:23.660 --> 03:26:26.900]   about being confident and scared that resonates with you?
[03:26:26.900 --> 03:26:29.820]   Or do you hold to this idea
[03:26:29.820 --> 03:26:31.740]   that you've kind of spoken about before
[03:26:31.740 --> 03:26:33.380]   that you're really not afraid?
[03:26:33.380 --> 03:26:36.500]   - No, I can appreciate what he's saying.
[03:26:36.500 --> 03:26:40.980]   I think that I can speak to feeling concerned about,
[03:26:40.980 --> 03:26:43.560]   let's say, for instance, if you feel a certain way,
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:45.180]   I think people are a lot more like computers
[03:26:45.180 --> 03:26:48.100]   than we like to admit.
[03:26:48.100 --> 03:26:50.380]   And just because a lot of times I can't parse
[03:26:50.380 --> 03:26:52.260]   what's going on and why,
[03:26:52.260 --> 03:26:54.620]   doesn't mean that it doesn't make sense.
[03:26:54.620 --> 03:26:55.460]   - I see.
[03:26:55.460 --> 03:26:57.660]   - And I think that at least in the times
[03:26:57.660 --> 03:26:59.740]   of like if I'm concerned about a situation
[03:26:59.740 --> 03:27:02.060]   or about a person or about something happening
[03:27:02.060 --> 03:27:05.140]   prior to the fight, or I'm like, there's a reason.
[03:27:05.140 --> 03:27:05.980]   There was a reason.
[03:27:05.980 --> 03:27:07.460]   I don't have to push that down and bury it.
[03:27:07.460 --> 03:27:08.300]   There's a reason.
[03:27:08.300 --> 03:27:09.120]   Like why?
[03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:09.960]   What have I not thought about?
[03:27:09.960 --> 03:27:10.780]   What have I not done?
[03:27:10.780 --> 03:27:11.980]   What am I missing?
[03:27:11.980 --> 03:27:13.140]   Why am I feeling this way?
[03:27:13.140 --> 03:27:15.580]   As you mentioned for yourself prior,
[03:27:15.580 --> 03:27:17.300]   like you'd be like, why am I feeling like this?
[03:27:17.300 --> 03:27:19.300]   I don't do this very well in certain aspects of my life
[03:27:19.300 --> 03:27:21.700]   if I'm not that I mentioned it or now that I think about it.
[03:27:21.700 --> 03:27:23.140]   But when it comes to competing,
[03:27:23.140 --> 03:27:24.340]   I think I do an all right job
[03:27:24.340 --> 03:27:25.420]   and I'm trying to learn to be better.
[03:27:25.420 --> 03:27:28.060]   And it's going like, well, why do I,
[03:27:28.060 --> 03:27:30.060]   if I feel this way, there's a reason.
[03:27:30.060 --> 03:27:31.860]   Okay, am I thinking about this the wrong way?
[03:27:31.860 --> 03:27:33.620]   Have I not adequately prepared for something?
[03:27:33.620 --> 03:27:35.420]   I have to address it.
[03:27:35.420 --> 03:27:37.980]   And then maybe I'll be up for four hours that night,
[03:27:37.980 --> 03:27:39.900]   like extra hours thinking, what have I not addressed?
[03:27:39.900 --> 03:27:42.460]   Watching sparring, watching this, watching that.
[03:27:42.460 --> 03:27:47.460]   And then when I am thinking about things more accurately
[03:27:47.460 --> 03:27:50.720]   or when I've addressed what that concern was,
[03:27:50.720 --> 03:27:53.580]   I feel any of that concern kind of dissipate.
[03:27:53.580 --> 03:27:57.460]   And I guess if I honestly thought that,
[03:27:57.460 --> 03:27:58.780]   I guess when it comes to,
[03:27:58.780 --> 03:28:00.700]   I know I'm gonna die at a certain point, obviously,
[03:28:00.700 --> 03:28:01.660]   I'm gonna get hurt.
[03:28:01.660 --> 03:28:03.540]   I'm gonna, pain happens,
[03:28:03.540 --> 03:28:07.100]   but the pain of loss would be nothing compared to the,
[03:28:07.100 --> 03:28:08.540]   or the pain of injury would be nothing compared
[03:28:08.540 --> 03:28:10.360]   to the pain of running away.
[03:28:12.180 --> 03:28:16.060]   And so I guess if I think about where's my value,
[03:28:16.060 --> 03:28:18.660]   it's like, I feel like I'm a winner
[03:28:18.660 --> 03:28:20.260]   every single time I step into that ring
[03:28:20.260 --> 03:28:21.580]   and fight with everything that I have.
[03:28:21.580 --> 03:28:23.700]   I can't promise that I'll win my next fight.
[03:28:23.700 --> 03:28:25.380]   I know that I have the skills and the tools
[03:28:25.380 --> 03:28:27.020]   to beat anyone in grappling
[03:28:27.020 --> 03:28:28.820]   or in mixed martial arts at this point.
[03:28:28.820 --> 03:28:32.260]   It's just, I know that for certain,
[03:28:32.260 --> 03:28:33.340]   I've trained with enough people,
[03:28:33.340 --> 03:28:34.180]   I've competed with enough people,
[03:28:34.180 --> 03:28:35.940]   I know where I stand,
[03:28:35.940 --> 03:28:37.500]   but I also know that I'm not perfect.
[03:28:37.500 --> 03:28:38.980]   And also the better fighter,
[03:28:38.980 --> 03:28:41.040]   even if I perceive that I was that thing,
[03:28:42.020 --> 03:28:43.420]   doesn't win on the night.
[03:28:43.420 --> 03:28:46.640]   The man who fights better wins on the night.
[03:28:46.640 --> 03:28:49.140]   And if I give credence in my mind
[03:28:49.140 --> 03:28:52.620]   to only the person that's one has value
[03:28:52.620 --> 03:28:54.180]   versus going, what's your process?
[03:28:54.180 --> 03:28:55.980]   What's your path through this?
[03:28:55.980 --> 03:28:57.020]   How are you going about this?
[03:28:57.020 --> 03:28:58.040]   How are you thinking about this?
[03:28:58.040 --> 03:28:59.600]   How are you behaving?
[03:28:59.600 --> 03:29:02.580]   Then if I can focus on the process,
[03:29:02.580 --> 03:29:04.980]   then I will respect my opponent
[03:29:04.980 --> 03:29:05.980]   and I will respect myself
[03:29:05.980 --> 03:29:08.580]   and I'll respect anyone that behaves
[03:29:09.060 --> 03:29:12.220]   with a certain level of consistency to that.
[03:29:12.220 --> 03:29:13.420]   And they could win.
[03:29:13.420 --> 03:29:14.980]   There's plenty of winners in history
[03:29:14.980 --> 03:29:16.060]   that are shitbags
[03:29:16.060 --> 03:29:18.200]   and there's plenty of losers that are not.
[03:29:18.200 --> 03:29:20.980]   But winning doesn't make you a bad or good person
[03:29:20.980 --> 03:29:23.340]   and losing doesn't make you good by default either
[03:29:23.340 --> 03:29:24.340]   or bad by default.
[03:29:24.340 --> 03:29:26.700]   So, and I think that that can be the truth socially,
[03:29:26.700 --> 03:29:29.980]   that can be the truth athletically and academically.
[03:29:29.980 --> 03:29:31.460]   So I guess-
[03:29:31.460 --> 03:29:33.020]   - Is there a primal fear though,
[03:29:33.020 --> 03:29:36.900]   like a primal fear of getting hurt?
[03:29:37.700 --> 03:29:42.700]   The running away and not facing the threat
[03:29:42.700 --> 03:29:46.420]   long-term is the bigger pain
[03:29:46.420 --> 03:29:48.720]   than any pain you can experience in the fight.
[03:29:48.720 --> 03:29:51.180]   That's pretty powerful.
[03:29:51.180 --> 03:29:52.620]   But what about the violence of,
[03:29:52.620 --> 03:29:54.020]   I mean, you don't have that on your face,
[03:29:54.020 --> 03:29:57.860]   but like, I don't know if you've also seen Tyson talk about,
[03:29:57.860 --> 03:29:59.020]   he was on "Rogan" recently
[03:29:59.020 --> 03:30:00.380]   and he was talking about,
[03:30:00.380 --> 03:30:04.380]   he was trying to psychoanalyze himself
[03:30:04.380 --> 03:30:08.820]   about why he enjoys violence so much.
[03:30:08.820 --> 03:30:12.460]   I mean, he called it orgasmic.
[03:30:12.460 --> 03:30:13.980]   I don't know, have you seen that clip?
[03:30:13.980 --> 03:30:14.820]   - I haven't.
[03:30:14.820 --> 03:30:17.420]   - Okay, we're playing it 'cause I can,
[03:30:17.420 --> 03:30:19.620]   I need to, 'cause Trump also retweeted it,
[03:30:19.620 --> 03:30:20.560]   which is hilarious.
[03:30:20.560 --> 03:30:22.700]   I don't know how to contextualize
[03:30:22.700 --> 03:30:27.700]   that our president retweeted the clip of Tyson saying-
[03:30:27.700 --> 03:30:30.500]   - Maybe he's just doing it like,
[03:30:30.500 --> 03:30:31.340]   they're not gonna, it's like,
[03:30:31.340 --> 03:30:32.340]   I'm gonna throw him a curve ball.
[03:30:32.340 --> 03:30:33.780]   No one's gonna have any idea what that is.
[03:30:33.780 --> 03:30:36.300]   - But yeah, he did no explanation, just, here you go.
[03:30:36.300 --> 03:30:37.780]   - There you go.
[03:30:37.780 --> 03:30:39.540]   Well, I think that's kind of like what you're describing.
[03:30:39.540 --> 03:30:40.740]   It's like, if I give you an answer,
[03:30:40.740 --> 03:30:41.700]   it has to be a good one.
[03:30:41.700 --> 03:30:43.340]   Better to just let your imagination run.
[03:30:43.340 --> 03:30:44.220]   - Exactly.
[03:30:44.220 --> 03:30:46.820]   Yeah, he's like the Kubrick of our time.
[03:30:46.820 --> 03:30:48.700]   (laughing)
[03:30:48.700 --> 03:30:50.920]   - Know what's really interesting?
[03:30:50.920 --> 03:30:52.160]   That sometimes,
[03:30:52.160 --> 03:30:57.260]   period, this is not real,
[03:30:57.260 --> 03:30:58.900]   but sometimes I struggle with the fact
[03:30:58.900 --> 03:31:02.060]   of why is there a possibility I can really hurt somebody?
[03:31:02.060 --> 03:31:03.660]   Like you don't wanna hurt them.
[03:31:03.660 --> 03:31:08.620]   What do you mean, but you struggle with the possibility
[03:31:08.620 --> 03:31:10.620]   that you could hurt them?
[03:31:10.620 --> 03:31:15.620]   - That is sometimes, it's orgasmic sometimes.
[03:31:15.620 --> 03:31:16.980]   Yeah.
[03:31:16.980 --> 03:31:21.140]   - Like some fights, like particularly like Tyrell Biggs
[03:31:21.140 --> 03:31:23.160]   or someone that you had problems with,
[03:31:23.160 --> 03:31:24.000]   someone that you-
[03:31:24.000 --> 03:31:24.840]   - Joe's not getting it.
[03:31:24.840 --> 03:31:26.880]   - You had animosity towards,
[03:31:26.880 --> 03:31:29.140]   so when you finally get your hands on them.
[03:31:29.140 --> 03:31:34.140]   - Hey, what does it mean when fighting gets you erect?
[03:31:34.140 --> 03:31:37.580]   What does that mean?
[03:31:37.580 --> 03:31:38.740]   - It's a good question.
[03:31:38.740 --> 03:31:41.500]   It means you're getting excited.
[03:31:41.500 --> 03:31:42.820]   - Yeah.
[03:31:42.820 --> 03:31:45.500]   - So that's going through your mind right now?
[03:31:45.500 --> 03:31:47.420]   - Well, that's how I get when I was a kid.
[03:31:47.420 --> 03:31:50.260]   And sometimes I get the twinkle.
[03:31:50.260 --> 03:31:51.100]   - The twinkle?
[03:31:51.100 --> 03:31:51.940]   - Yeah.
[03:31:51.940 --> 03:31:52.780]   - Well, that's what I'm saying.
[03:31:52.780 --> 03:31:55.660]   It's like you reached a state as a human being,
[03:31:55.660 --> 03:31:58.420]   as a champion, as a ferocious fighter,
[03:31:58.420 --> 03:32:02.660]   you reached a state of ability and of accomplishment
[03:32:02.660 --> 03:32:06.180]   that very few humans will ever touch and feel.
[03:32:06.180 --> 03:32:08.740]   That's why I'm asking you, when you're running,
[03:32:08.740 --> 03:32:11.260]   when you're hitting the bag, when that heart's beating again
[03:32:11.260 --> 03:32:15.020]   and you know who you are, you're Mike motherfucking Tyson.
[03:32:15.020 --> 03:32:16.220]   So when you're doing all this shit again,
[03:32:16.220 --> 03:32:17.660]   you're still Mike Tyson.
[03:32:17.660 --> 03:32:20.780]   Those thoughts have got to be burning inside you again.
[03:32:20.780 --> 03:32:22.140]   It's got to be pretty wild.
[03:32:22.140 --> 03:32:23.900]   - I don't know.
[03:32:26.180 --> 03:32:31.180]   It's wild, but I believe it's rightfully so to be that way.
[03:32:31.180 --> 03:32:35.060]   And I just know how to, I don't say I'm mastered,
[03:32:35.060 --> 03:32:36.580]   but I just know how to deal with it.
[03:32:36.580 --> 03:32:38.540]   I don't let it overwhelm me.
[03:32:38.540 --> 03:32:41.100]   - I mean, he goes on to try to, they don't ever,
[03:32:41.100 --> 03:32:45.100]   like Joe doesn't bite.
[03:32:45.100 --> 03:32:48.020]   Well, the interesting thing about that conversation
[03:32:48.020 --> 03:32:51.220]   is Mike was trying to figure himself out.
[03:32:51.220 --> 03:32:52.060]   - Yeah.
[03:32:52.060 --> 03:32:53.300]   - Like he's trying on the spot.
[03:32:53.300 --> 03:32:55.820]   Like, why do I feel this way?
[03:32:55.820 --> 03:33:03.980]   To me it was like, to me it's so real and honest
[03:33:03.980 --> 03:33:08.980]   to feel like pleasure from hurting somebody.
[03:33:08.980 --> 03:33:12.680]   Like that, you rarely hear that.
[03:33:12.680 --> 03:33:18.700]   In this society, it's like, you rarely like talk about like,
[03:33:18.700 --> 03:33:21.860]   you feel pleasure from winning.
[03:33:22.700 --> 03:33:27.700]   You feel pleasure from like the relief of overcoming
[03:33:27.700 --> 03:33:30.860]   like all the stress you had to go through.
[03:33:30.860 --> 03:33:35.260]   Pleasure from just like the specifics of the fight,
[03:33:35.260 --> 03:33:36.460]   the techniques he used,
[03:33:36.460 --> 03:33:39.980]   the maybe overcoming being down a couple of rounds.
[03:33:39.980 --> 03:33:42.620]   But like, how often do you hear somebody say,
[03:33:42.620 --> 03:33:45.300]   I just enjoyed, he's not even saying
[03:33:45.300 --> 03:33:46.620]   because I hate the opponent.
[03:33:46.620 --> 03:33:51.620]   He's saying like, I enjoyed purely the violence of it.
[03:33:52.060 --> 03:33:52.900]   It's crazy.
[03:33:52.900 --> 03:33:54.540]   I mean, I don't know, it's honest.
[03:33:54.540 --> 03:33:57.220]   It made me ask like,
[03:33:57.220 --> 03:34:00.540]   I wonder how many of us are cognizant of that.
[03:34:00.540 --> 03:34:05.540]   - I'd say Mike is uncommonly, seemingly honest.
[03:34:05.540 --> 03:34:08.580]   I think athletes make a full-time job out of lying.
[03:34:08.580 --> 03:34:10.420]   You know, I think people make a full-time job out of lying.
[03:34:10.420 --> 03:34:11.380]   - To themselves perhaps too.
[03:34:11.380 --> 03:34:12.220]   - That's fair.
[03:34:12.220 --> 03:34:15.020]   I mean, you tell yourself or you tell others
[03:34:15.020 --> 03:34:16.060]   what you feel you need to,
[03:34:16.060 --> 03:34:18.900]   or maybe whether you even know what you feel you need to,
[03:34:18.900 --> 03:34:21.180]   but why should he not?
[03:34:21.180 --> 03:34:24.300]   I mean, again, did he run up and just hit somebody
[03:34:24.300 --> 03:34:26.980]   that didn't sign up for this?
[03:34:26.980 --> 03:34:28.580]   No, they signed up to be there.
[03:34:28.580 --> 03:34:31.500]   - Well, that's the interesting thing about Dyson
[03:34:31.500 --> 03:34:36.500]   is there's that weird, like non-standard behavior.
[03:34:36.500 --> 03:34:40.180]   I mean, like your fighting style is non-standard.
[03:34:40.180 --> 03:34:43.220]   He's non-standard to another degree of like,
[03:34:43.220 --> 03:34:45.100]   who else has that?
[03:34:45.100 --> 03:34:50.100]   In jiu-jitsu, Paul Ares has this kind of weirdness,
[03:34:50.820 --> 03:34:54.940]   like what's in there?
[03:34:54.940 --> 03:34:59.940]   Like there's a fear that I think most opponents would have,
[03:34:59.940 --> 03:35:03.140]   because it's like, it's no longer about like,
[03:35:03.140 --> 03:35:06.340]   it takes you out of the realm of it's game.
[03:35:06.340 --> 03:35:08.660]   It takes us back to the thing we were talking about
[03:35:08.660 --> 03:35:12.860]   like before is it strips away that like several layers
[03:35:12.860 --> 03:35:16.700]   of Ryan Hall, the podcast guest,
[03:35:16.700 --> 03:35:18.220]   Ryan Hall, the jiu-jitsu instructor,
[03:35:18.220 --> 03:35:19.940]   Ryan Hall, the jiu-jitsu competitor.
[03:35:19.940 --> 03:35:22.700]   It keeps going down to a point where like Ryan Hall,
[03:35:22.700 --> 03:35:25.420]   the murderer of all things that get in his way
[03:35:25.420 --> 03:35:28.860]   that lies underneath all of it seemingly.
[03:35:28.860 --> 03:35:32.180]   Like if we're, like in this society, we put all that aside,
[03:35:32.180 --> 03:35:33.340]   but it makes you wonder,
[03:35:33.340 --> 03:35:36.260]   like now society's being tested in many ways.
[03:35:36.260 --> 03:35:39.700]   It makes you wonder like what's underneath there.
[03:35:39.700 --> 03:35:41.740]   - Well, do we want the answer to that?
[03:35:41.740 --> 03:35:42.980]   'Cause I guess it's, what is it?
[03:35:42.980 --> 03:35:44.300]   You've seen "Pulp Fiction,"
[03:35:44.300 --> 03:35:45.780]   the best character in the movie
[03:35:45.780 --> 03:35:47.100]   and in the best scene in the movie.
[03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:48.740]   It's like if my questions,
[03:35:48.740 --> 03:35:49.580]   if you're, what do you call it?
[03:35:49.580 --> 03:35:50.400]   If my answer is scary,
[03:35:50.400 --> 03:35:52.700]   you should cease asking scary questions.
[03:35:52.700 --> 03:35:55.700]   And I guess you wonder, I mean, all of us,
[03:35:55.700 --> 03:35:57.140]   that's something that I think it's funny.
[03:35:57.140 --> 03:35:58.260]   We go, oh, that's not okay.
[03:35:58.260 --> 03:36:03.260]   I mean, versus maybe not appropriate for situation X, Y, or Z
[03:36:03.260 --> 03:36:06.100]   but what should make any of us think?
[03:36:06.100 --> 03:36:07.860]   I mean, humanity is a different place now.
[03:36:07.860 --> 03:36:09.580]   And I mean, I'm not saying anything crazy out there,
[03:36:09.580 --> 03:36:10.780]   but humanity is a different place now
[03:36:10.780 --> 03:36:12.820]   than we were 5,000 years ago
[03:36:12.820 --> 03:36:15.360]   where all of us are descended from people
[03:36:15.360 --> 03:36:18.600]   who have killed things with their teeth and fingernails.
[03:36:18.600 --> 03:36:20.260]   In order to be where we are.
[03:36:20.260 --> 03:36:22.780]   And whether it was an animal
[03:36:22.780 --> 03:36:24.660]   or it was in conflict with another person.
[03:36:24.660 --> 03:36:27.540]   I mean, think about the chances of dying by violence now
[03:36:27.540 --> 03:36:29.940]   are so, so slim, at least in most countries,
[03:36:29.940 --> 03:36:32.660]   in most places, like shockingly small, thankfully.
[03:36:32.660 --> 03:36:34.340]   But there was a period of time,
[03:36:34.340 --> 03:36:36.900]   like the most period of time where dying by violence
[03:36:36.900 --> 03:36:38.660]   was mostly how it went down.
[03:36:38.660 --> 03:36:41.900]   And I guess what would be facilitative?
[03:36:41.900 --> 03:36:44.740]   What would allow you to win back to end this game?
[03:36:44.740 --> 03:36:47.940]   What allows you, if you can't do that,
[03:36:47.940 --> 03:36:51.280]   you are forever subject to people who can.
[03:36:51.280 --> 03:36:54.160]   And that's a real thing.
[03:36:54.160 --> 03:36:57.020]   And we're fortunate to find ourselves in a situation
[03:36:57.020 --> 03:36:59.300]   where we don't, where other things matter.
[03:36:59.300 --> 03:37:01.360]   But that is a funny thing periodically where people,
[03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:03.320]   you'll see people like kind of drawing at each other,
[03:37:03.320 --> 03:37:05.160]   like in videos or out in the world
[03:37:05.160 --> 03:37:07.600]   that clearly neither of them expect this to get serious.
[03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:08.440]   Like, I'm just gonna yell at you,
[03:37:08.440 --> 03:37:09.260]   you're gonna yell at me.
[03:37:09.260 --> 03:37:10.460]   And it's like this weird LARPing thing
[03:37:10.460 --> 03:37:12.580]   where we're both gonna go on our own separate way.
[03:37:12.580 --> 03:37:13.920]   All it takes is one person to be like,
[03:37:13.920 --> 03:37:15.520]   well, I wasn't kidding.
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:16.720]   And it's like, oh, you'll go to jail.
[03:37:16.720 --> 03:37:18.520]   I'm like, oh, I know.
[03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:19.680]   You're gonna go to the morgue.
[03:37:19.680 --> 03:37:22.460]   And it's, but that can happen like that.
[03:37:22.460 --> 03:37:23.800]   Like society, I mean, obviously,
[03:37:23.800 --> 03:37:25.080]   anyway, you could jump across the table,
[03:37:25.080 --> 03:37:26.300]   stab me in the eye.
[03:37:26.300 --> 03:37:27.740]   I mean, I'd hope if you don't,
[03:37:27.740 --> 03:37:29.400]   and there will be consequences if you do,
[03:37:29.400 --> 03:37:32.920]   but not from me, from the rest of society
[03:37:32.920 --> 03:37:35.160]   will potentially get you at a certain point.
[03:37:35.160 --> 03:37:37.400]   But you can decide to not play by the rules
[03:37:37.400 --> 03:37:38.680]   anytime you want.
[03:37:38.680 --> 03:37:40.600]   - It's fascinating that, yeah, that's,
[03:37:40.600 --> 03:37:43.200]   we've created rules based on which we all behave,
[03:37:43.200 --> 03:37:45.600]   but underneath there, you know,
[03:37:45.600 --> 03:37:48.040]   there's things that doesn't,
[03:37:48.040 --> 03:37:49.880]   there's motivations and forces
[03:37:49.880 --> 03:37:51.120]   that don't play by the rules.
[03:37:51.120 --> 03:37:52.080]   - Oh, for sure. - And it's still there.
[03:37:52.080 --> 03:37:54.840]   Nature as metal is under the surface.
[03:37:54.840 --> 03:37:56.700]   - Seriously, and again, I pull out my phone
[03:37:56.700 --> 03:37:58.560]   and I'm basically saying like, hey,
[03:37:58.560 --> 03:38:00.320]   I'm gonna, you're gonna get caught.
[03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:02.560]   But really I'm further antagonizing you,
[03:38:02.560 --> 03:38:03.840]   rightly or wrongly, you know what I mean?
[03:38:03.840 --> 03:38:05.880]   Like, and that's an interesting thing.
[03:38:05.880 --> 03:38:07.760]   And I feel like just people need to remember,
[03:38:07.760 --> 03:38:09.140]   any of us need to remember,
[03:38:09.140 --> 03:38:10.740]   just for any reason,
[03:38:10.740 --> 03:38:14.560]   just that's one step away at all times.
[03:38:14.560 --> 03:38:16.360]   Do you ever, I've had people say to me before,
[03:38:16.360 --> 03:38:17.440]   like, oh, I don't feel safe.
[03:38:17.440 --> 03:38:18.720]   I'm like, you're not safe.
[03:38:18.720 --> 03:38:20.300]   I'll kill you before you get out of this room.
[03:38:20.300 --> 03:38:22.320]   Nothing you can do to stop that, nothing.
[03:38:22.320 --> 03:38:24.880]   I mean, but don't worry, you can do the same to me,
[03:38:24.880 --> 03:38:26.280]   which means I'm like, oh, oh, thank goodness.
[03:38:26.280 --> 03:38:27.680]   Can you imagine like how many guns
[03:38:27.680 --> 03:38:29.480]   are there are in this country?
[03:38:29.480 --> 03:38:31.360]   Like, I mean, everywhere.
[03:38:31.360 --> 03:38:32.580]   I mean, seriously, everywhere.
[03:38:32.580 --> 03:38:34.040]   But that's a heartening thought, not the other way,
[03:38:34.040 --> 03:38:35.440]   'cause people usually freak out and go,
[03:38:35.440 --> 03:38:36.880]   oh my God, gun violence, gun violence.
[03:38:36.880 --> 03:38:39.080]   Gun violence is like really not a serious issue
[03:38:39.080 --> 03:38:41.620]   in the United States compared to what it could be,
[03:38:41.620 --> 03:38:43.080]   because it means that, I mean,
[03:38:43.080 --> 03:38:45.800]   with the amount of guns and the amount of bullets
[03:38:45.800 --> 03:38:48.240]   that are out there that are in circulation,
[03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:50.800]   can you imagine if like one in every thousand
[03:38:50.800 --> 03:38:52.640]   was used in anger each day?
[03:38:52.640 --> 03:38:54.840]   I mean, this would be a terrifying place to live.
[03:38:54.840 --> 03:38:55.740]   You couldn't go anywhere.
[03:38:55.740 --> 03:38:57.080]   So I mean, although you could say,
[03:38:57.080 --> 03:38:59.360]   hey, this is more than we'd like, or X, Y, Z,
[03:38:59.360 --> 03:39:01.400]   it actually means that people are much more reasonable
[03:39:01.400 --> 03:39:03.240]   and sane than we're saying,
[03:39:03.240 --> 03:39:06.200]   than or than sometimes I might argue.
[03:39:06.200 --> 03:39:07.440]   So I guess what I mean is like, oh man,
[03:39:07.440 --> 03:39:10.000]   I walked to 7-Eleven and I didn't get stabbed.
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:10.920]   I'm like, oh, well, that's good,
[03:39:10.920 --> 03:39:13.840]   because not because I protected myself with my karate,
[03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:16.400]   it's basically no one decided to run over and stab me
[03:39:16.400 --> 03:39:18.080]   because I wasn't protecting myself.
[03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:19.700]   It's, they stopped.
[03:39:19.700 --> 03:39:22.440]   So I guess we're all fortunate to live in a society
[03:39:22.440 --> 03:39:24.440]   that like you said, nature being metal,
[03:39:24.440 --> 03:39:26.200]   doesn't become that big of an issue all the time.
[03:39:26.200 --> 03:39:27.760]   But it is funny when you get people in the ring
[03:39:27.760 --> 03:39:31.240]   and you go, hey, let's peel back from Mr. Tyson,
[03:39:31.240 --> 03:39:34.520]   many layers of that and say, hey, now it's okay.
[03:39:34.520 --> 03:39:37.400]   - And it's cool that, I mean, that's what society's doing.
[03:39:37.400 --> 03:39:40.160]   So I've lived in Harvard Square for a while
[03:39:40.160 --> 03:39:44.400]   and we add extra layers of what safe means.
[03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:47.840]   Like now there's a discourse about safe spaces,
[03:39:47.840 --> 03:39:52.840]   about like ideas being violence or like, yeah.
[03:39:52.840 --> 03:39:57.040]   But ideas or minor slights
[03:39:57.040 --> 03:39:59.500]   against your personality being violence.
[03:39:59.500 --> 03:40:01.940]   But that's all like extra layers
[03:40:01.940 --> 03:40:05.420]   around the nature is metal thing that it's cool.
[03:40:05.420 --> 03:40:06.760]   That's what progress is,
[03:40:06.760 --> 03:40:09.800]   but we can't forget that like underneath it,
[03:40:09.800 --> 03:40:13.680]   it's still the thing that will murder
[03:40:13.680 --> 03:40:18.680]   at the drop of in any, at any moment if aroused.
[03:40:18.680 --> 03:40:20.880]   - One thing that I find funny though,
[03:40:20.880 --> 03:40:24.960]   or ironic maybe about the words of violence,
[03:40:24.960 --> 03:40:27.500]   offense is violence thing is that of course,
[03:40:27.500 --> 03:40:32.320]   that if that the belief in that then justifies my violence.
[03:40:32.320 --> 03:40:34.920]   Like my, and whether maybe not physical violence,
[03:40:34.920 --> 03:40:38.880]   but my response to my aggressive response to things.
[03:40:38.880 --> 03:40:40.280]   And I guess like, which again,
[03:40:40.280 --> 03:40:42.640]   begets a further aggressive response
[03:40:42.640 --> 03:40:46.400]   and like a kind of a tit for tat sort of situation
[03:40:46.400 --> 03:40:48.400]   or it goes to like, well, there's 10 of me
[03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:49.800]   and there's one of you, so we'll get you
[03:40:49.800 --> 03:40:51.360]   and you can't do anything about it.
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:52.840]   But that's not morality.
[03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:55.240]   That's just saying that's might makes right.
[03:40:55.240 --> 03:40:57.240]   So I guess, again, you can understand why people do it
[03:40:57.240 --> 03:41:00.060]   and there are certain, there is a progress aspect to it.
[03:41:00.060 --> 03:41:03.000]   But again, I guess without proper examination,
[03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:05.840]   I'm effectively with my 10 friends,
[03:41:05.840 --> 03:41:08.720]   and the force of the law, Mike Tyson-ing people.
[03:41:08.720 --> 03:41:10.800]   But not admitting to myself what I'm doing.
[03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:13.840]   And at least Mike Tyson, again, is honest.
[03:41:13.840 --> 03:41:16.400]   - Are you afraid of death?
[03:41:16.400 --> 03:41:18.760]   - I mean, it's easy for me to say no,
[03:41:18.760 --> 03:41:21.200]   as I sit here probably not about to die, but.
[03:41:21.200 --> 03:41:22.660]   - Is this like the UFC question,
[03:41:22.660 --> 03:41:24.200]   can you defeat any opponent?
[03:41:24.200 --> 03:41:26.640]   - Exactly, the answer is of course, yes.
[03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:28.120]   And I don't have, they're not around,
[03:41:28.120 --> 03:41:29.000]   they're not here, are they?
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:30.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[03:41:30.280 --> 03:41:31.720]   But- - I mean, are you,
[03:41:31.720 --> 03:41:33.460]   do you ponder your own mortality?
[03:41:33.460 --> 03:41:36.400]   Maybe another context to that is you mentioned
[03:41:36.400 --> 03:41:39.120]   two deaths for martial artists.
[03:41:39.120 --> 03:41:40.840]   - I think that's actually why, honestly,
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:42.600]   even though at a relatively young age,
[03:41:42.600 --> 03:41:45.240]   I think mortality is something that I'm aware of,
[03:41:45.240 --> 03:41:46.400]   maybe more than the average person.
[03:41:46.400 --> 03:41:48.360]   I think probably most athletes can speak to this,
[03:41:48.360 --> 03:41:51.640]   anyone that's had, I've managed to slide out
[03:41:51.640 --> 03:41:54.160]   of a couple near-death experiences personally,
[03:41:54.160 --> 03:41:57.700]   mostly river-related, because I'm an idiot.
[03:41:57.700 --> 03:41:59.480]   But I regret nothing.
[03:41:59.480 --> 03:42:02.200]   But yeah, but thank God we're here.
[03:42:02.200 --> 03:42:05.800]   But yeah, it is an interesting, seeing the end,
[03:42:05.800 --> 03:42:10.760]   and seeing going, well, what's gonna happen.
[03:42:10.760 --> 03:42:13.280]   I guess, I think it comes back to kind of
[03:42:13.280 --> 03:42:14.840]   what we were discussing about belief structure
[03:42:14.840 --> 03:42:16.080]   and belief system.
[03:42:16.080 --> 03:42:18.800]   I think a lot of times, if I recognize that
[03:42:18.800 --> 03:42:22.240]   no matter what I do, it's all gonna end one day,
[03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:23.680]   then you go, well, why were we here?
[03:42:23.680 --> 03:42:24.640]   What would I do?
[03:42:24.640 --> 03:42:26.320]   Am I gonna make it to 40?
[03:42:26.320 --> 03:42:27.280]   I have no idea.
[03:42:27.280 --> 03:42:28.760]   I'd like to hope so.
[03:42:28.760 --> 03:42:30.180]   I had no idea that I was gonna make it
[03:42:30.180 --> 03:42:31.760]   to the age that I am now.
[03:42:31.760 --> 03:42:33.700]   Am I gonna make it to 80?
[03:42:33.700 --> 03:42:35.460]   How much of that is in my control?
[03:42:35.460 --> 03:42:37.600]   Much of it is not.
[03:42:37.600 --> 03:42:38.760]   I mean, it's so funny.
[03:42:38.760 --> 03:42:40.720]   It's an interesting, back to the belief structure,
[03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:44.360]   again, locus of internal and external locus of control,
[03:42:44.360 --> 03:42:47.360]   what's facilitative versus what's true.
[03:42:47.360 --> 03:42:49.720]   And I think accepting personal responsibility
[03:42:49.720 --> 03:42:52.840]   for more than is in my control is probably a positive.
[03:42:52.840 --> 03:42:55.720]   But at the same time, recognizing that
[03:42:55.720 --> 03:42:57.880]   much is not in my control.
[03:42:57.880 --> 03:43:00.540]   I was fortunate enough to be born in the United States,
[03:43:00.540 --> 03:43:03.920]   fortunate enough to not knock on wood,
[03:43:03.920 --> 03:43:07.400]   have a serious disease that I'm not aware of right now.
[03:43:07.400 --> 03:43:08.360]   I didn't do any of that.
[03:43:08.360 --> 03:43:09.840]   I just showed up.
[03:43:09.840 --> 03:43:11.040]   That was really fortunate.
[03:43:11.040 --> 03:43:13.800]   And I guess that doesn't diminish the fact
[03:43:13.800 --> 03:43:16.620]   that I've tried to make decent choices,
[03:43:16.620 --> 03:43:18.460]   but it works in concert with it.
[03:43:18.460 --> 03:43:23.460]   And I guess when you go, is death what I want right now?
[03:43:23.460 --> 03:43:26.320]   No, no, I should think not.
[03:43:26.320 --> 03:43:28.360]   And again, it's easier for me to be relatively calm
[03:43:28.360 --> 03:43:30.320]   about it as I'm not staring it in the face.
[03:43:30.320 --> 03:43:35.320]   But what I would care a lot more about is how you live.
[03:43:35.320 --> 03:43:37.020]   That's what's in my control.
[03:43:37.020 --> 03:43:39.660]   And I can't control if as I walk out of this building,
[03:43:39.660 --> 03:43:41.380]   a helicopter falls on me.
[03:43:41.380 --> 03:43:42.780]   Worrying about that, I can't control.
[03:43:42.780 --> 03:43:44.940]   Maybe I have cancer now and I don't know it.
[03:43:44.940 --> 03:43:46.380]   And I really hope not.
[03:43:46.380 --> 03:43:47.480]   But--
[03:43:47.480 --> 03:43:49.380]   - There's something about meditating on the fact
[03:43:49.380 --> 03:43:51.200]   that it could end today.
[03:43:51.200 --> 03:43:54.540]   Outside of your control, they can clarify your thinking
[03:43:54.540 --> 03:43:58.180]   about the fact that life is amazing.
[03:43:58.180 --> 03:43:59.020]   Like just kind of--
[03:43:59.020 --> 03:43:59.860]   - Some of it.
[03:43:59.860 --> 03:44:01.460]   - Yeah, helping you enjoy this moment.
[03:44:01.460 --> 03:44:03.660]   - Even if life was horrible, let's say for instance,
[03:44:03.660 --> 03:44:06.440]   it was, you live at one of those times or places,
[03:44:06.440 --> 03:44:08.620]   and those places still exist in this world today,
[03:44:08.620 --> 03:44:12.340]   that life is brutal and metal and whatever all,
[03:44:12.340 --> 03:44:15.860]   and short and painful, would you still want it?
[03:44:15.860 --> 03:44:19.540]   And again, as I'm sitting here not on fire physically,
[03:44:19.540 --> 03:44:21.660]   it's easy to say yes, but I would, I'm confident,
[03:44:21.660 --> 03:44:24.020]   I still, I'll plant my feet and say yes.
[03:44:24.020 --> 03:44:27.380]   Any life is amazing and beautiful and a gift,
[03:44:27.380 --> 03:44:29.620]   an unbelievable gift.
[03:44:29.620 --> 03:44:31.780]   But that none of us have earned, for the record.
[03:44:31.780 --> 03:44:32.740]   I hate the word earned.
[03:44:32.740 --> 03:44:33.980]   A lot of times earned, yeah, you earn,
[03:44:33.980 --> 03:44:36.940]   but it's like, there's a lot of good fortune in earning.
[03:44:36.940 --> 03:44:40.860]   And that's back to, do I want justice or do I want grace?
[03:44:40.860 --> 03:44:43.420]   And I guess we're all fortunate to be where we are
[03:44:43.420 --> 03:44:44.340]   no matter where we are.
[03:44:44.340 --> 03:44:47.180]   And hopefully it should give us some sense of perspective,
[03:44:47.180 --> 03:44:48.940]   some sense of compassion for other people,
[03:44:48.940 --> 03:44:51.460]   but also, like you said, a sense of peace.
[03:44:51.460 --> 03:44:54.500]   If it all ended right now, would I be happy
[03:44:54.500 --> 03:44:56.260]   with life to this point?
[03:44:56.260 --> 03:44:57.300]   I'm like, of course.
[03:44:57.300 --> 03:44:58.900]   Would you like to live a little longer?
[03:44:58.900 --> 03:45:01.980]   Yeah, I would try to do more and try to live rightly
[03:45:01.980 --> 03:45:04.060]   to the best that I know how, which over time
[03:45:04.060 --> 03:45:07.340]   will hopefully continue to evolve in a positive direction.
[03:45:07.340 --> 03:45:12.340]   But if the answer to that is no, I guess that's always,
[03:45:12.340 --> 03:45:15.060]   that's a sign that what I'm doing
[03:45:15.060 --> 03:45:16.300]   is not what I'm meant to be doing.
[03:45:16.300 --> 03:45:19.220]   And I mean, you're familiar with Tecumseh before.
[03:45:19.220 --> 03:45:21.100]   So there's a, I've got one, actually,
[03:45:21.100 --> 03:45:23.660]   if you could give me 10 seconds, I'll read this one out.
[03:45:23.660 --> 03:45:26.500]   This is a personal favorite, basically.
[03:45:26.500 --> 03:45:28.340]   And I think it sums up, I mean, again,
[03:45:28.340 --> 03:45:29.860]   it's one of those quotes on the internet,
[03:45:29.860 --> 03:45:31.020]   like when Abraham Lincoln said,
[03:45:31.020 --> 03:45:33.060]   "Don't believe everything you read online."
[03:45:33.060 --> 03:45:37.740]   But this is, it's again, attributed, but it's like,
[03:45:37.740 --> 03:45:39.260]   "So live your life that the fear of death
[03:45:39.260 --> 03:45:40.780]   "can never enter your heart.
[03:45:40.780 --> 03:45:42.420]   "Trouble no one about their religion,
[03:45:42.420 --> 03:45:43.740]   "respect others in their view,
[03:45:43.740 --> 03:45:45.660]   "and demand that they respect yours.
[03:45:45.660 --> 03:45:47.460]   "Love your life, perfect your life,
[03:45:47.460 --> 03:45:49.580]   "beautify all things in your life.
[03:45:49.580 --> 03:45:50.860]   "Seek to make your life long,
[03:45:50.860 --> 03:45:53.140]   "and its purpose in the service of your people.
[03:45:53.140 --> 03:45:54.780]   "Prepare a noble death song for the day
[03:45:54.780 --> 03:45:56.820]   "when you go over the great divide.
[03:45:56.820 --> 03:45:58.580]   "Always give a word or sign, a salute,
[03:45:58.580 --> 03:45:59.900]   "when meeting or passing a friend,
[03:45:59.900 --> 03:46:02.900]   "even a stranger, when in a lonely place.
[03:46:02.900 --> 03:46:06.040]   "Show respect to all people, and grovel to none.
[03:46:06.040 --> 03:46:07.180]   "When you arise in the morning,
[03:46:07.180 --> 03:46:09.920]   "give thanks for the food, and for the joy of living.
[03:46:09.920 --> 03:46:11.440]   "If you see no reason for giving thanks,
[03:46:11.440 --> 03:46:13.620]   "the fault lies only in yourself.
[03:46:13.620 --> 03:46:14.980]   "Abuse no one and no thing,
[03:46:14.980 --> 03:46:16.900]   "for abuse turns the wise ones to fools,
[03:46:16.900 --> 03:46:19.100]   "and robs the spirit of its vision.
[03:46:19.100 --> 03:46:20.420]   "When it comes your time to die,
[03:46:20.420 --> 03:46:21.700]   "be not like those whose hearts
[03:46:21.700 --> 03:46:23.240]   "are filled with the fear of death,
[03:46:23.240 --> 03:46:24.340]   "so that when their time comes,
[03:46:24.340 --> 03:46:25.920]   "they weep and pray for a little more time
[03:46:25.920 --> 03:46:28.720]   "to live their lives over again in a different way.
[03:46:28.720 --> 03:46:31.840]   "Sing your death song and die like a hero going home."
[03:46:31.840 --> 03:46:32.940]   - Powerful words.
[03:46:32.940 --> 03:46:35.180]   I don't think there's a better way to end it.
[03:46:35.180 --> 03:46:40.180]   Let me just say, we've spoke maybe five, six years ago.
[03:46:40.180 --> 03:46:41.460]   I don't even remember when,
[03:46:41.460 --> 03:46:44.260]   but I'm not exaggerating saying,
[03:46:44.260 --> 03:46:47.500]   you had a huge impact on my life because of the podcast.
[03:46:47.500 --> 03:46:50.820]   You're the reason I was doing the podcast,
[03:46:50.820 --> 03:46:52.100]   as long as I have.
[03:46:52.100 --> 03:46:55.140]   You're the reason I'm doing this podcast.
[03:46:55.140 --> 03:46:57.560]   And it's a stupid little meeting
[03:46:57.560 --> 03:46:59.160]   that you probably didn't know who I was.
[03:46:59.160 --> 03:47:00.960]   I didn't really know who you are.
[03:47:00.960 --> 03:47:02.460]   It was just like a magical moment.
[03:47:02.460 --> 03:47:05.400]   It's a flap of a butterfly wing kind of situation.
[03:47:05.400 --> 03:47:07.660]   And yeah, I'm forever grateful.
[03:47:07.660 --> 03:47:11.040]   You're one of the most inspiring people in my life.
[03:47:11.040 --> 03:47:14.920]   So Ryan, it's a huge honor that you would come here,
[03:47:14.920 --> 03:47:18.520]   Jen, and talk with me, and waste all this time.
[03:47:18.520 --> 03:47:19.360]   I really appreciate it.
[03:47:19.360 --> 03:47:20.400]   It was amazing.
[03:47:20.400 --> 03:47:21.240]   - Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:47:21.240 --> 03:47:22.080]   It's just been a pleasure.
[03:47:22.080 --> 03:47:23.200]   I really appreciate you having us on.
[03:47:23.200 --> 03:47:24.040]   Thank you.
[03:47:24.040 --> 03:47:24.860]   - Thanks, brother.

[03:47:49.700 --> 03:47:52.060]   from Frank Herbert in Dune.
[03:47:52.060 --> 03:47:53.940]   "Deep in the human unconscious
[03:47:53.940 --> 03:47:56.260]   "is a pervasive need for a logical universe
[03:47:56.260 --> 03:47:57.660]   "that makes sense.
[03:47:57.660 --> 03:48:01.700]   "But the real universe is always one step beyond logic."
[03:48:01.700 --> 03:48:04.460]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
