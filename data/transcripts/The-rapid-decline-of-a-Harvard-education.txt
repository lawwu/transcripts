[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai, and in this podcast, I'm going to talk about the rapid
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.280]   depreciation of a Harvard education and how private school grads can still save themselves.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.120]   Funny topic, I know, but it's something that's a current event and I think everybody should
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:24.300]   be aware of, parents and alumni and non-elite private school education graduates as well.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.920]   When I was applying to college in 1994, I thought only extremely smart people attended
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.160]   Ivy League schools.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.240]   I'd heard stories about the rich buying their kids ways into the Ivy League, but I was unaware
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.580]   of the details.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:45.720]   As a public high school kid with an OK SAT score, a 3.63 GPA, and unspectacular extracurricular
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.840]   activities, I didn't go to Rwanda and save a starving village from disease.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.560]   I was a tennis team captain, for example.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.240]   I decided to save myself, but really my parents, hundreds of dollars in application fees and
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.660]   apply to mostly local state schools like UVA, Mary Washington, and the College of William
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.400]   and Mary instead.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.360]   Paying less than $3,000 a year in in-state tuition even back then felt like a steal.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.920]   After graduating from William and Mary in 1999, I got a job in the International Equities
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.560]   Department at Goldman Sachs in New York City.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.720]   That's where I got to interview hundreds of Ivy League and other elite private institution
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.920]   graduates as part of Goldman's consensus-driven interview process, where even the most junior
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.940]   members got to interview candidates.
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.480]   We ended up rejecting 98% of the candidates due to poor fit.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.560]   It wasn't that they were not smart, because they were.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.920]   We only wanted people we would feel comfortable sitting next to for 12-14 hours a day.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.640]   It obviously helped if they had an international background, spoke multiple languages, and
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.320]   had a passion for the stock market.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.920]   But we were mostly looking for great teammates, because everything is really learned on the
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.760]   job.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.800]   Interviewing the majority of elite private college graduates made me realize they are
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.080]   no different from you and me.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.040]   For the next 13 years, I'd compete with these folks on the ruthless battlegrounds
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.400]   of finance and smash them to bits like Hulk, most of the time because of my hunger.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.960]   Coming from a non-target public school background with middle class parents who worked for the
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.720]   government, I wasn't going to squander my opportunity for financial independence.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.880]   Today I am a small business owner with business owning friends, and what we've noticed is
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.680]   that there is a growing negativity towards those who attend or have already graduated
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.200]   from elite private schools.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.960]   Don't get mad, just be aware of this trend against the 1%.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.120]   We saw that with Occupy Wall Street movement during the financial crisis.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.840]   We're seeing that now with politics, Jared Kushner's dad donating $2.5 million for
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.920]   his son to get into Harvard.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.680]   There's this uproar and it's thanks to technology and the internet.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.680]   So don't be upset if you're one of these alumni.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.160]   Instead, listen with an open mind and pay attention as your future or your kid's future
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.720]   might depend on it.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.000]   So this podcast will address why there is a growing negative perception about private
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.520]   university graduates, what we've learned from the Harvard Asian American Discrimination
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.600]   Lawsuit, what you can do to fight back against this negative perception, and the future of
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.840]   higher education.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.320]   So one of the reasons why Harvard University fought so hard to keep its admissions process
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.560]   a secret was because it didn't want the world to judge it for how it picked winners
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.600]   and losers, because boy do they ever.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.400]   Due to social media and the internet, they knew that the jury of public opinion would
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.560]   come down on them like a guillotine.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.800]   Here are some interesting facts that we've learned so far from the Asian American Discrimination
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.000]   Lawsuit against Harvard.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.360]   The overall acceptance rate is about 5.9%.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.040]   But if you're a legacy, in other words, if one or two parents went to Harvard, the acceptance
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.680]   rate is 33.6%.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.600]   If you are a child of donors and not legacy, your acceptance rate goes to 40%.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.520]   And if you are both legacy and your parents are donors, the acceptance rate is above 70%.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.600]   So think about these statistics for a bit.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.680]   You are simply born into a family where one of your parents or grandparents, I think,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.440]   went to Harvard, you have a five times greater chance of getting to the university than someone
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.120]   who has no legacy status.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   One can argue legacy admissions help create a stronger university culture.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.000]   I believe that.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.660]   And there should be some preference.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.080]   But a 5x preference seems quite excessive.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.600]   Meanwhile, if you donate money to Harvard, which already has the world's largest university
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.480]   endowment at over $35 billion, your child's acceptance rate goes up by 7x the average
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   admissions rate.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.640]   Based on conversations I've had with a Harvard undergraduate and business school alum who
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.520]   also was on their fundraising committee for a couple years, between 2000 and 2010, you
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.680]   could probably donate between 250 to 500,000 and effectively help give your child a 7x
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680]   advantage.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.320]   Today, he says the donation figure is in the millions.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.400]   Now imagine you are a legacy candidate whose parents are also rich enough to donate millions
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.480]   of dollars to Harvard.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.240]   You've got a 12x greater chance of getting to Harvard than some smart kid with great
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.920]   extracurricular activities whose parents are simply not as rich or connected enough to
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   help.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.200]   You are practically a shoe-in guarantee.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.100]   In other words, this is not a meritocracy by any means.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.160]   This is affirmative action for the rich.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.220]   So nobody likes a rigged game.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.800]   If you are competing one-on-one against your friend and he's cheating because he's got
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.440]   a cheat code, and you find out, you're going to be pissed off.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.620]   So it's no surprise that there is a growing negativity against Harvard and other schools
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.520]   that practice this type of admissions criteria.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.400]   Now we should accept that Harvard and other private institutions have the right to craft
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.040]   their classes however they see fit.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.180]   This is one of the benefits of not accepting government assistance and being private.
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.480]   After all, we have the right to apply to wherever we want as well.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:29.240]   However, Harvard and other private institutions should at least acknowledge they use race,
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.560]   legacy, money, and athletics as determinant factors in their subjective crafting of an
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.320]   incoming class.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.560]   They should own their subjectivity with pride.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.360]   They should say, "Yes, we do discriminate against people based on whatever criteria
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.720]   we choose is the right criteria."
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.980]   Instead, they just say, "No, no, we don't.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.180]   Everything is quite objective," which we all know is false, which is another reason
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:02.700]   why the public, who is not stupid, is going to have a negative perception on these universities
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.460]   and their graduates.
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.800]   But the real fallout may rain on those private university graduates who actually have no
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.580]   legacy connections and no donor parents.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:18.080]   So in terms of no legacy students, it's about 67%.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.100]   So the majority who simply got in due to merit.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.020]   As the reputations of private universities decline with the wider understanding of how
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.980]   the system works, many of its graduates may be unfairly lumped with those graduates who
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.860]   received massive non-merit-based advantages.
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:42.660]   Therefore, the one solution is to clearly state on your resume or job application, "Not
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.060]   a legacy or a donor graduate."
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.740]   By clearly stating, you got no help from what society hates most about the aristocracy,
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.760]   you distinguish yourself and enhance your accomplishment.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.180]   You may feel that highlighting you're not a legacy and not a donor might come across
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.060]   as too forward, and it will, especially if the hiring manager comes from a private university
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.420]   whose parents did donate and did go to such a university.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.480]   And this is why you must do your background checks on your interviewers before making
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:17.660]   your case, and when you state it, you just must state it as a matter of fact and not
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.740]   flower it with opinion and a lot of subjectivity.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.340]   The vast majority, vast vast majority of parents will not have donated hundreds of thousands,
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.620]   let alone millions to buy their kids way into an elite university.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.380]   They don't even have the means, right?
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.600]   Nobody has those type of means except a very few.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.740]   Just look at the statistics.
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:42.060]   Even only 40% of Americans have a two-year college degree or more, less than 5% of all
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.620]   Americans will have attended elite private school universities.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.580]   The reality is it's probably less than 1%.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.540]   In other words, a super majority is on your side, so don't be afraid to stand up for
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.060]   meritocracy.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.340]   The gatekeepers agree.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.340]   Who are the gatekeepers?
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.980]   Well, they are the employers.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.100]   As a small business owner, I want to hire the most collaborative, smartest, efficient,
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.060]   and hungriest person available.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.340]   I don't really care where they went to college.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.340]   All I care about is their attitude and willingness to learn and get things done, and whether they're
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:21.340]   going to be a prima donna and pain in my butt, or are they going to do and say what they
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.380]   say they're going to do and stay hungry and keep on hustling.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.620]   If I can find an Ivy League graduate with such attributes who got in 100% due to merit,
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.180]   I'm going to hire this type of person all day long, all else being equal.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.940]   But if I can't, because the person is unwilling or cannot say they aren't a legacy donor,
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.240]   then I'm going to have to do a thorough search.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   More thorough search.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.300]   I've spoken to a couple friends who both employ over 100 people, and one friend, who
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.220]   is a public CEO, who employs over 3,000 people about the Harvard lawsuit.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.140]   They all actively welcome graduates of elite private universities to declare they are not
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.380]   legacy or donors.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.860]   Two went to public university, so therefore they are biased just like me, and while one
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.540]   went to an elite private university and doesn't think he got in due to money or connections.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.020]   Old money industries like banking, private equity, venture capital, money management,
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.480]   and management consulting are filled with elite private school alumni who will continue
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.760]   to have their biases, so tread carefully.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:28.540]   But new money industries like tech and biotech are extremely focused on meritocracy, because
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:34.940]   after all, they must create something new and hustle and strive to get ahead, whereas
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.820]   the big guys, the old establishments, it really is like old money in your neighborhood.
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:45.220]   People who are just living off trust funds and generational wealth thanks to their grandparents.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:51.520]   But over time, I'm confident old money industries will slowly remove their biases as well, starting
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:57.040]   by casting a wider recruiting net beyond specific private universities.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.360]   One of the end goals of going to college is to get a good job as possible, so if the gatekeepers
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.600]   are changing the way they hire, you best believe universities will change the way they accept
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.860]   students as well.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.480]   The internet democratizes knowledge and access.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.240]   I've said this before and I'll say it again and forever.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.840]   Therefore over the long term, college degrees will be devalued.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.800]   Elite private university degrees will be no exception.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.440]   Nobody wants to help the rich and powerful get more rich and powerful anymore because
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.640]   people have a better understanding of how the system works.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:34.160]   We've had an incredible recovery in the bull market for almost 10 years now, and as a result,
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:41.080]   the rich have gotten way richer and the disgruntlement, the anger is starting to fester, starting to
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.240]   build against these folks.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:51.320]   More people will be empowered to create their own fortunes through entrepreneurship or freelancing.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:57.640]   The rich and powerful are clinging on to elite education as the last bastion of the aristocracy,
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.440]   while the commoners are using battering rams to break down the gates.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.800]   So if you are or will be an alumnus of Harvard or other similar institution, I encourage
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.360]   you to do the following.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.360]   1.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.600]   Don't voluntarily tell anybody where you went to college.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.920]   If people ask, talk about the state or city where you went to school and then quickly
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.480]   change the topic.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.080]   It's so funny here in the San Francisco Bay Area, you know when someone went to Stanford
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.760]   because they'll tell you in the first two sentences.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.840]   2.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.960]   Stay humble.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.400]   Instead of talking about your wins, discuss your struggles.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.640]   3.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.280]   Build your giving resume.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.880]   That includes time and money, and hopefully time.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.840]   Eventually people will find out about you, and if they realize you've received all this
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.320]   help while you've done little to nothing to give back, you'll be skewered.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.600]   Besides, helping other people is the greatest gift on earth.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   4.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.320]   Stop working at companies that create useless products or take advantage of minimum wage
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   laborers.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.080]   Don't let your education and family wealth go to waste.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.940]   If you're oblivious, you'll know once you see your company being questioned on the news
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.320]   about their labor practices.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.960]   And then finally, let your kids earn their way through life.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.040]   One of the worst things you can do is take away your kids' sense of pride and accomplishment
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.960]   by giving them everything.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.160]   Let your kids deserve what they've earned.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.080]   Nobody, let me be clear, nobody should blame parents for giving their kids every advantage
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.980]   possible to get ahead.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:30.640]   And no kid should be blamed for receiving every advantage possible either.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.400]   We're all trying to do our best here.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.080]   It's a competitive world.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.760]   Let's just not fool ourselves into thinking there aren't extreme biases in the system
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.640]   that put the majority of people at a competitive disadvantage.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.240]   We will never be a true meritocracy.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.400]   We will have different definitions of what is fair and what is not fair.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:57.440]   But at least we can take steps to help even the playing field by fighting for our beliefs.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.180]   Ignore the uprising at your own peril.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.560]   This is really important, especially if you're a parent.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.480]   And I'm thinking out loud here as a parent, am I willing to spend a million dollars on
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.800]   a private school education when this is happening in the future?
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   I don't know.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.980]   I could see a huge uprising in 10, 20 years where people say, you know what, we've had
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:25.560]   enough of this aristocracy and this unfair rigged system.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.560]   No more.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.120]   Let's bar people from such institutions.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:34.880]   It could be extreme, but you can see that happening as people see the rich, the widening
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.520]   wealth gap just continue to get wider.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.320]   I think there's a good chance this this uprising will happen.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.600]   I've personally decided to keep some insurance, which is to keep Financial Samurai running
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.040]   until my little boy grows up and tells me he wants nothing to do with running a location
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.840]   independent small business that gives you all the freedom in the world.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.980]   That's gonna be interesting conversation.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.800]   And even when he tells me, I hope he doesn't.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.580]   But even when he tells me, I don't want all the freedom in the world to be my own boss
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.640]   and to make my own rules.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.720]   I think just in case he changes his mind and faces the harsh realities of the world, I'm
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.520]   going to keep Financial Samurai going for as long as possible.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:25.160]   Maybe one day he'll thank me and maybe I'll one day continue to have something to do and
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.000]   talk about long into the future.
