[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960]   Well, God commands us to love him.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.340]   He commands us to delight in him.
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.380]   He commands our cheerfulness.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.540]   We see this all over our Bibles in the cluster of texts that we've talked about many times
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:26.100]   over the years in Deuteronomy 2847, Psalm 3211, Psalm 374, Psalm 100 verse 2, Romans
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.940]   128, 2 Corinthians 9.7, Philippians 3.1, Philippians 4.4, 1 Thessalonians 5.16, just to name a
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.860]   few of those texts.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.420]   Those nine texts I just mentioned in total have made close to 90 appearances on this
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.300]   podcast now.
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.180]   This casting of our cheerfulness and joy in God as a point of obedience is something that
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.380]   causes a lot of Christians to scratch their heads.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.340]   Our happiness is a moral issue to God.
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.540]   It's about obedience, and over that point we see disagreements or misunderstandings
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:06.180]   between Pastor John and other theologians, which we saw in ABJ 1584, just as one example.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.260]   At the core of Christian hedonism is a bringing together of our obedience to God, our delight
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.700]   in God, and our glorifying of him.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.100]   Here's Pastor John explaining how it all connects in a 1989 sermon.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.460]   Morality and law are words that sound negative.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.140]   They sound burdensome.
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.420]   They sound oppressive.
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.220]   They sound limiting and constricting.
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.420]   So at this point you're up against saying to somebody, you ought to do something, or
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.060]   you should do something.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.140]   And those words in our culture are fighting words.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.820]   We are, we are libertarians to the core when it comes to our own personal religion and
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.820]   morality.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.260]   We don't want anybody telling us we should or ought to do something.
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.140]   So now what do you do here?
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.900]   Because in people's minds you've got this oppressive sense, duty, law, burden.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:11.380]   So I want to show you that God's demand for love from you, gratitude from you, trust from
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.020]   you, and obedience from you is a way to glorify him that is not burdensome.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.100]   It is not legalistic.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:30.420]   It is not restricting and confining and a hardship.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.740]   Now here's the way I'm going to show that to you.
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.980]   Now I said last time that we are supposed to be mirrors of God's glory, like the light
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.620]   coming through there this morning.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.340]   You're supposed to be a polished mirror so that when your life is in the right angle,
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.420]   the right biblical angle, the glory of God shines out in a commendable and attractive
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.340]   way to the world.
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.020]   Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good deeds and give glory to
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.020]   your Father.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.060]   The other, the other analogy I used was the crystal or the prism.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.660]   And I said each one of you is a uniquely shaped human crystal or prism so that when it is
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:18.020]   positioned in the light of God's glory, it refracts out many different colors and lights.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.060]   Only you can display for this world some of the things that ought to be seen about God.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.780]   Now that's a duty to live that way and that's not a burden to live that way.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.620]   And I think I can show you with several illustrations.
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.940]   If it is your duty to glorify God because He is beautiful and glorious, consider this
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.580]   illustration.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.420]   If there's a beautiful painting in your house or in a museum somewhere and you go to it
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.780]   and it is beautiful to you, how do you glorify that painting?
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.780]   Do you glorify that painting and say, "Oh, I got to go buy some paint now and work on
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.780]   it a little bit.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.420]   It needs a border or it needs a little more orange."
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.740]   And you burden yourself with the need to improve it.
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.800]   That would be burdensome.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.660]   But that's not the way you glorify a painting.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.540]   That's an insult to a painting.
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:27.440]   The way you glorify a painting is by enjoying it, by delighting in it, and by speaking excitedly
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.860]   of it to people who are near you, your friends, inviting them to go to the museum and see
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.860]   it.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.380]   And that's no burden and every one of you knows that's no burden.
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.420]   If you love the painting, you will delight in it and that glorifies the painting.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.300]   Or let me use a more homely illustration that's more relevant to most of us.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.380]   Suppose somebody makes an excellent meal for you and it is not only tasty, it's beautiful
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.740]   on the table and it is nutritious.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.120]   It's the kind of thing you ought to eat as well as like to eat.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.020]   How do you glorify the cook?
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.220]   Do you glorify the cook by putting on an apron and say, "Oh my, we got to work on this."
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.260]   Now you go out in the kitchen and you add some more spices or you say, "Oh, we don't
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.740]   have any chips."
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.500]   I think of that because Noel always used to say, "So I would say, aren't there any chips?"
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.740]   You're not supposed to have chips with this meal.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.860]   This is not a chips meal.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.580]   I did not glorify her culinary arts by asking for chips.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:48.140]   The way to glorify a cook is to eat a lot of the food.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:56.420]   And when you're done to say things like, "Mmm" or "Ahh," that's it.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.620]   Now is that a burden?
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.660]   If you've got an excellent meal in front of you, your duty, your law is to glorify this
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.720]   meal and this cook.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:14.420]   Is that a burden to do when the way to glorify the meal is to eat a lot of it and to say,
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.500]   "Mmm" and "Ahh," we call that worship at Bethlehem.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.900]   Here's another illustration.
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:29.220]   Suppose it's your duty to glorify the strength of a new alloy, a metal that has been created
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:37.980]   by somebody and it is in a bridge that holds up a road across a chasm.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.940]   Now this is an old fashioned illustration.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.020]   How do you glorify the strength of that alloy?
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.660]   Do you glorify the strength of that alloy?
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.380]   Boy, we've got to buy some two by fours and work up a good sweat propping up the bridge
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.860]   before we go over.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.180]   Well, that's a dishonor to the alloy.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.100]   The way you glorify the alloy is by gathering all your family, all the little ones, all
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:09.220]   the old ones in your car and with not one whiff of anxiety, drive right across the bridge
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.300]   singing as you go.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.300]   Is that a burden?
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:23.140]   It is not a burden to trust strength if it is strength.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:30.300]   And if you're called upon to glorify the strength of Almighty God, nobody ought to be able to
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.220]   persuade you that's a burden.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.580]   It isn't a burden.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.220]   It's freedom to trust strength.
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.780]   Here's another illustration.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:49.420]   Suppose you are required by law, divine authority to glorify generosity or to glorify grace
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.860]   or kindness in the heart of God or a friend.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:58.220]   Let's just say a good rich friend that you have who just happens to be so lavish in his
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.220]   generosity.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.460]   He gives you things freely.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.820]   Now how do you glorify that person and his generosity?
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.580]   What by trying to pay him back.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.780]   Ooh, this is a mistake we make with God.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.900]   We say, God has been so good to me now.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.180]   What can I give him to pay him back?
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.620]   Do you know what that does to grace?
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.940]   It turns it into a business transaction.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.860]   It rips the heart out of grace.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.740]   How do you glorify grace?
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:38.580]   Primarily by allowing spontaneously lavish gratitude to well up in your heart.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:45.740]   I mean, which of you, if a billionaire came up and handed you a check for a million dollars,
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.180]   would say, "Oh no, I'm going to have to be thankful."
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:54.620]   Burden, heavy load, law, duty.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.780]   Nobody.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.260]   You see what people have done with Christianity?
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:07.780]   It is no burden to glorify God's grace.
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:16.140]   Don't let anybody tell you that Christianity is a summons to loss.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.420]   So I want to close with this question.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:26.380]   Have you come this morning on the run from God thinking, "I'm not going to turn to the
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.380]   Christian God.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.100]   I'm not going to bow before God because it means loss, loss, loss.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.100]   I lose this, this, this, this."
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.380]   Is there anybody here like that?
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:41.980]   If there is, I just pray and I hope that I have shown you just enough, a little tip of
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:48.020]   the iceberg of God's glory that will say, "It is not loss.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:53.540]   Whatever you give up to become a Christian because it happens to be sin will be repaid."
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:58.500]   The Bible says, "One hundredfold, both in this life and in the life to come."
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:04.700]   And I just beg of you, wherever you are in your flight from God or your quest for God,
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:10.020]   that you will turn to Him, recognize Him as a fountain of grace and glory and beauty and
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.380]   strength and yield to Him.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.340]   Yeah, Pastor John doing what he does, pressing these two themes of delighting in God and
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:25.180]   glorifying God into their organic unity as one aim, one goal.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.900]   That's from a sermon titled "The Joyful Duty of Man," preached on January 22nd, 1989.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.220]   It can be found online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.780]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke, and we are rejoining in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.260]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260]   [END]
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.260]   1.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.260]   John 1:3 "The joy of man is the joy of his heart.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.260]   He is not a man, but a man, who believes in God."

[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.260]   John 2:8 "But if man believes in God, he is not a man,
