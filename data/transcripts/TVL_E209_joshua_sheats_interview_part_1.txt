[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.160]   Hi, it's Jake here. Welcome to The Voluntary Life.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   This is an episode about tax and I think it's relevant for anyone who's interested in entrepreneurship,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.640]   but also just for anyone who's interested in financial independence and working towards more financial freedom.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.440]   Tax is a really important topic.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.320]   I want to talk about this issue strategically and I'm really pleased to have a special guest to talk this through with me.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.760]   It is Joshua Sheets, the host of the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.360]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.920]   Good morning, Jake. I'm glad to be here.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.040]   Yeah, really pleased to have you on the show.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.520]   You're currently in Florida, is that right?
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.200]   West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.400]   Awesome. Well, I really appreciated your invitation to appear on your show a while back
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.240]   and we had some great chats about the permanent portfolio and entrepreneurship.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.120]   I wanted to bring you on to talk to you about your area of expertise in finance, in particular in terms of tax.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.640]   But for those people who didn't hear those previous episodes,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.880]   can you just give a little bit of a background to your background in finance and what your podcast is about?
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.000]   I come from a mixture of backgrounds, which is how I wound up doing a podcast.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.360]   I was a long time, I call it personal finance junkie.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.000]   From an early age, even before when I was a boy, I wanted to be rich.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.320]   That was one of my major life goals and so I started studying everything I could learn about how to actually be rich.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.520]   That led me deep into the personal finance world.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.560]   Through a series of circumstances, I wound up working in the financial advice industry after college,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.960]   working as a professional financial advisor and spent six years in that business.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.880]   And on both sides of the aisle, I call it the personal finance world versus the professional financial advice world.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.040]   I became frustrated with the opposite side.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.880]   As a personal finance junkie, I was annoyed with the financial advice industry
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.040]   and how many things that I thought they were doing wrong.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.160]   And then I got over in the financial advice industry and I got annoyed with all the stuff on the personal finance side
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.200]   that I found to be inaccurate and many people very well-meaning,
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.040]   but just simply ignorant and inaccurate in what they were saying.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.720]   And so that led to my desire to see somebody put together kind of a combination of those worlds,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.760]   bringing together everything from the world of personal finance,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.200]   whether it's the big picture stuff like goal setting, life planning, a comprehensive view of life,
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.480]   or whether it's just the simple things like budgeting or how to actually manage the technical day-to-day details
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.960]   and the professional financial advice world.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   So technical details on how the tax code works in the United States of America,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   creative ways to use some of the benefits that most people don't think about,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.240]   the in-depth nature of different financial products and how each of them has advantages and disadvantages.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.040]   And all of that stuff came together to be personal finance and essentially radical personal finance.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.760]   Essentially, the goal is to create the kind of show that I wish I'd had to go from no knowledge whatsoever of finance
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.000]   to the equivalent of a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.240]   I actually have a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.280]   And so I'm trying to give away everything I know on the podcast for free
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   and support the independent media space by putting my content out there and helping others.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.680]   I think it's awesome and you are prolific.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   You're putting out, I think, on average, it's like an episode a day, isn't it, that you're doing?
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.800]   Just about. We're on average over four a week.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.200]   I shoot for five, but I'm not necessarily every day committed to that.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.000]   But I do try to put out a lot of content.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.480]   And the content, I try to keep it extremely varied.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.240]   So I do interviews, my basic schedule, I do about two interviews a week.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.040]   And I try to interview people from interesting perspectives, some of them rich, some of them not.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   Some of them have set up interesting, unique lifestyles and some of them haven't.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.760]   I try to do a big picture show on things like goal setting, life planning, alternative ways of approaching life.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:41.360]   I try to do a technical financial planning show where I go through some of the details of the US finance law.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.560]   And then I answer questions and listen to Q&A.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.480]   And I try to basically just create the kind of show that I wish I had had ten years ago to listen to every day on my commute.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.200]   Awesome. Well, I'm really pleased to have you on the show to talk about this subject.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.360]   And I thought I would start off by giving you my perspective on why I wanted you to talk this through with me.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.880]   So as you know, we tackle issues to do with entrepreneurship and achieving financial independence on the voluntary life in lots of different ways.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.560]   And when you look at the question of tax and look at the books that are out there on financial independence,
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.680]   a lot of books like, for example, the classic Your Money or Your Life have almost nothing to say about tax.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:31.120]   They focus on opportunities for saving and investing through saving money on what is typically referred to as three big areas of spending,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.520]   your housing, your transportation and your food.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:43.120]   And yet other books like, for example, The Millionaire Next Door talk about tax and especially income tax as the number one expense in life.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.600]   So it seems to me tax, if you're interested in financial independence, it's a really key issue.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.440]   But some people don't even tackle it at all.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.320]   So how important do you think it is for people who are interested in financial independence to really address this question of tax?
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:07.520]   Depending on the jurisdiction and tax authority under which somebody lives, and that will vary across the world and even within countries,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.960]   it will vary from county to county.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.800]   But for most people, I think it's their number one biggest expense.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.080]   Usually it's not seen that way because we only see taxes one at a time.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.680]   So for example, you might have a certain amount of income tax that you owe.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.120]   But even within the United States, we have different types of tax that are levied against our income.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.680]   And most people are only familiar with one of them and they don't see it.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.120]   And so what I teach people to do is to calculate all of your tax.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.480]   And I'll give you a simple example that I believe would have some parallels in the U.S.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.440]   But it's a simple example from the U.S. tax code.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.920]   In the United States, we have what we call employment taxes.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:52.240]   And this is what funds our systems of socialized benefits, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.000]   And for employees, this is levied against their income before their actual paycheck is received
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.800]   at a rate of 7.65 percent.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.520]   The employee pays 7.65 percent and the employer pays 7.65 percent.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.480]   So it comes out to about 15 percent, just over 15 percent when you add that up.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.360]   Then on top of that, by the way, just to let you know and to interrupt,
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.880]   and we have exactly the same kind of thing.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.280]   It's called national insurance contributions here.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.320]   Very, very similar.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.240]   So, yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.000]   So, yes, do carry on.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.240]   OK, so most people are completely ignorant of that in terms of they don't factor that
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.160]   into their budget because they only sit down after the fact and actually run their budget
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.880]   much later.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.920]   And they only run it based upon what they actually, the money that shows up in their
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.320]   checking account after their check is direct deposited.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.800]   Well, that's 7.65 percent of your income.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.400]   And in reality, it's 15 percent of your income, because if you weren't paying that tax,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.640]   your employer would go ahead and send that money to you.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.040]   From the employer's perspective, it's just a cost of doing business.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.840]   And whether it goes to you or to the government, they don't have a choice in that.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.600]   So that's essentially equivalent to 15 percent of their income missing.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.520]   But most people don't ever calculate that, even when you get to the more straightforward
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.120]   number, which is income tax.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.120]   So in the U.S., we run through and you calculate all of your income and then you pay a certain
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.480]   level of income tax.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.320]   I have a little experiment that I play with folks, and I always ask them, "How much did
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.920]   you pay last year in income tax?"
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.480]   And then I wait for the answer.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.440]   And I would guess about 90 percent of the time, the answer is, "Oh, I didn't pay anything.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.560]   I got back $2,000."
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.080]   And because the way it works in the U.S. is some amount of money is automatically deducted
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.520]   from your paycheck, and then people at the end of the year will file a tax return and
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.160]   many people will do a refund from the federal government.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.240]   But nobody actually understands how to sit down and read the tax forms and look and see,
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.440]   "Oh, I actually paid $9,000 of federal income tax.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.840]   And even though I got $1,000 back, that was simply because I'd overpaid $1,000 through
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.640]   the course of the year."
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.520]   So when you start listing them out, and what I teach people to do the very first step is
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.960]   make a comprehensive list of all of your expenses and all of your income, and you start fundamentally
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.960]   individually identifying, "I'm paying this amount in employment tax," or for you, national
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.000]   insurance contribution, "I'm paying this amount in income tax.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I'm paying this amount in property tax.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.080]   I'm paying this amount in sales tax."
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.360]   And it goes on and on.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.280]   And actually identify where each dollar goes.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.960]   It can lead to substantial savings.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.120]   And I'll give one story that might provide a little bit of incentive to actually do it.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.960]   I had one listener called in and wrote me an email to my show and his letter to me said,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.000]   "I want to thank you for the content that you've created on your show.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.480]   Because of you, today is my wife's last day at work."
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.960]   And the story he told me was that by listening to my show, they had found in their family
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:42.480]   $30,000 of savings that could be had by his wife staying at home with their kids.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.120]   Meaning, she was probably earning something like $50,000 per year.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.760]   But the tax level was so high at that incremental amount, and they were able to find some other
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:57.280]   savings that in effect, if she stayed home, they'd only be out about $20,000 of income.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:03.200]   And the net effect on their lifestyle of the amount of work that she was doing and the
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.680]   stressed existence of both people going out to salary jobs and fighting rush hour traffic
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.920]   and having to hurry through and put the kids in daycare and all of that wasn't worth it
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.040]   for $20,000 a year.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.520]   But a major component of it was actually understanding the tax involved.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.000]   And they could see that they actually saved $30,000 by her not working.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.080]   That is really interesting.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.840]   And so basically, what they were dealing with that couple, and we have a very similar system
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.440]   here is that if you have progressive income tax, where the more you work, effectively,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:39.040]   the more tax you pay and also your tax rate goes up, then as a couple, you've got to
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.040]   sometimes reach the point where it's really questionable, is it really worth one of us
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.000]   working because of the amount that we're losing in taxes?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.800]   And so that's what I get from what you're saying is, in their case, it actually was
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.040]   better off having the opportunity for them not to.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.260]   Exactly.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.000]   Right.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.160]   Now, that's really helpful.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.840]   And that brings me on to the question, the next question that I have for you, which is
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.520]   the comparison between being an employee and being an entrepreneur, because I come at this
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.480]   question from an entrepreneur's background, and looking at taxes, and in particular, income
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.840]   tax, because we were just talking about that example of that couple with income tax.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:22.480]   It seems to me that there is a much bigger scope for reducing your tax liability relative,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.880]   especially to the amount of value that you're creating and your potential for reaching financial
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.080]   independence in the future from becoming an entrepreneur relative to being an employee.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.760]   Is that your view as well?
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.320]   What do you have to say about the comparison of employee versus entrepreneur when it comes
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:38.880]   to tax?
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.840]   In the US, there's a big debate among different political parties about, you know, do we,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.920]   should we tax the rich or should we tax the poor?
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.880]   And people talk about having different tax loopholes for people at different income levels.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.120]   There might be some of those things that exist.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.840]   I haven't been able to specifically identify them, but I am convinced there are two tax
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.640]   codes in the US.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.360]   There's a business owner tax code and there's an employee tax code.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:07.440]   And it's exactly like you say, the individual employee has almost no flexibility with their
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.480]   tax planning.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:14.400]   But the employer, the entrepreneur, even at the smallest, simplest level has an incredible
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.240]   amount of flexibility in their tax planning.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.520]   And I often get questions from people.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.600]   I was working with a couple recently and just talking and this couple is high income earners.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.560]   One spouse is a pharmacist.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.640]   The other spouse is a physical therapist.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.000]   And both of them are employees earning an excellent amount of income.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.440]   And we're looking at their tax bill and they're like, we paid so much in tax.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.160]   What can we do?
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.520]   Well, unfortunately, as an employee, there were a few little tricks, but none of them
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.600]   that make nearly as big of a difference as if we could take $100,000 of income and have
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.360]   one of the spouses stop working as an employee pharmacist and start running a pharmacy of
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.440]   their own or moving to their own independent company.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.280]   And I could go into details, but essentially, it's a huge difference.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.960]   Right.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.760]   Well, I do want to go into more details on the entrepreneur side.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.120]   I'm definitely interested in that.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.520]   But let's stick with the employees for just for a moment, because that is an interesting
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:19.040]   one, because I know that a lot of people who are pursuing the kind of extreme saving approach
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.400]   to trying to reach financial independence, they're doing it as employees.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:29.200]   They have full time jobs and they're maxing out their savings within tax deferred or tax
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.440]   exempt savings accounts and retirement accounts.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:39.200]   But it seems to me that if you are an employee, that's one of the kind of main ways that you
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.600]   can try and save tax is by using tax deferred accounts.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.640]   Is that the way that you see it as for employees?
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.760]   Absolutely.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.480]   That's about that's about the only big one.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   The ability to defer, you know, depending on the type of account, something like 17,
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.120]   18 thousand dollars of your own money into the account and and, you know, delay the income
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.160]   tax on it in the US, that would be 401ks, IRAs.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.760]   And every country has a similar system.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.280]   That's that's the biggest savings.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.240]   To answer the question, let me give you a quick bit of background.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.480]   And there's a little bit of a framework that I use.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.400]   And for years, I would read these little books and these personal finance things.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.080]   And they would talk about putting money into IRAs or putting money into retirement accounts,
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.640]   things like that.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.440]   And I would read them and I didn't have a framework to fit them into.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.640]   And then one time I was reading a financial planning textbook and it was going through
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.600]   and giving the framework.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.200]   And once I found this, it helped me to understand everything.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   And it's a framework that any person in any tax jurisdiction can apply to any tax.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:46.080]   There are only three basic things that you can do to to change the level of taxation
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.440]   that you're the only three basic strategies that you can apply to tax planning.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.240]   The first strategy is timing.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.680]   The second strategy is income shifting.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.720]   And the third strategy is conversion.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.920]   Let me give some examples so you understand.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.400]   Cool.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.760]   With regard to timing, the only thing that you can do under a timing strategy is to either
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.440]   defer income to the future.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:18.000]   When hopefully you'll be paying tax at a lower rate or accelerate income today to where you're
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.920]   going to be paying tax at a lower rate or deferring tax deductions to the future or
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.240]   accelerating a tax deduction to today.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.520]   Those are all going to be income timing strategies.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.600]   So the simple example of a retirement account, the way that most of the retirement accounts
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.880]   work in most of our countries is you put money into the retirement account and you don't
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:44.960]   pay any income tax today, but rather you defer the income to the future and you're going
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.680]   to pay income tax in the future under whatever rate you're paying at that point in time.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.800]   And so the idea is I'm deferring it toward retirement years and I'm going to be paying
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.240]   tax at a lower rate then.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.240]   So therefore, I'm going to pay a lower aggregate rate by deferring the income.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.440]   Now, on the flip side, you can also accelerate income.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.400]   And sometimes you might find yourself in a very low tax bracket.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.480]   And some of the hardcore savers in the US, they apply this strategy.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.360]   They save, save, save for five or six years and then they quit earning money and that
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.080]   drops them down into an extremely low tax bracket.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.640]   And so now they go ahead and accelerate some of the income out of those retirement accounts
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.280]   and they keep it in at the zero percent tax brackets and they go ahead and bring it into
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.600]   today when they're paying tax at a low rate.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.800]   So those are deferring income or accelerating income.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.880]   And the key variable is what's the total rate that we're going to be paying on each dollar
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.360]   of income.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.280]   That's all going to come into a timing strategy.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.160]   - Okay, okay.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.440]   Now, that sounds great.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.360]   Now, I definitely want to hear about the other two, but let me just interject there just
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.200]   to give an example of what you're talking about to kind of make this more concrete.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.480]   So for example, I sold my business to a much larger company.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.000]   And when I did that, I went from being an entrepreneur to being an employee.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.600]   I became a director in this larger company.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.360]   I had to go and work in this company.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.840]   So I found myself for the first time in many, many years actually being an employee.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.880]   And during that period of time, it was three years that I worked for this company,
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.200]   I put the absolute maximum amount that I could into the UK equivalent of a retirement account.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.400]   We call it a pension here, but I don't think you use quite the same terminology.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.320]   But so I was putting the maximum amount that I could from my income into this retirement
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.200]   account so that I wouldn't get taxed on the income.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.160]   And if I'd just taken that as income, I would have had income tax.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.000]   And so I would have lost that money in tax.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.200]   So I've done exactly what you're saying, which is to defer tax on that money, which is now
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.560]   sitting in a retirement account, and I won't be able to access that until I think it's,
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.240]   I think maybe when you're 55 in the UK is the first time you can access some of it.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.360]   And then, and then you'll start, you get some tax free, and some of it you have to
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.520]   pay income tax on.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:00.400]   But in the meantime, it also, it can accumulate interest and grow tax free as well inside
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.840]   this sort of shelter.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.480]   So that strategy is very, very clear to me.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.760]   But the other thing that you said about, you know, the extreme savers who then accelerate
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.160]   that income, I don't know if that works in the UK, because you see our pensions, the
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.800]   way that it works here is once you, if you do put that money aside, in our equivalent
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.520]   of retirement accounts, you can't access that until you're aged 55 or whatever.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.560]   But it sounds to me like that's not the case in the US.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.080]   Is it different for you there?
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.200]   Do you have any exceptions that you're aware of?
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.280]   For example, in the UK, if you put money into a pension account, and you decide to buy a
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.440]   home for the first time, can you take money out for that?
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.800]   Or if you have a you go through bankruptcy, can you take money out for that without paying
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.520]   penalties?
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.720]   I think there is there are some I'm definitely not the expert on this.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.560]   There are some exceptions that you like you we have something called self invested pension,
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.080]   where you can also use their pension to, to buy property or various other things.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.320]   So there is some there is a certain amount of flexibility, but essentially, the money's
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.120]   kind of locked up until until you're able to get to it.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.240]   Again, I'm not an expert.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.520]   So maybe I'm just missing a huge chunk of opportunities.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.320]   But it sounds like there's quite a lot more flexibility in the States.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.960]   There's been a there have been a few changes in the last few years that have added some
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.760]   of the flexibility.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.160]   And these are unintended loopholes, intended or unintended doesn't really matter.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.600]   What happens is nobody in the US country in the world, probably nobody actually understands
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.480]   the tax code.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.920]   And the politicians are the worst.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.960]   They don't understand it either.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.840]   So they pass things and then later we find out what's in it and then they they add a
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.320]   patch to it and they change something and adjust it.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.160]   So what I was referring to as far as the change, there's a little strategy in the US that
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.680]   they call the Roth conversion ladder.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.560]   And so fundamentally, there are two major different types of pension accounts.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.480]   We do call them pensions, although most people don't, but the technical financial planner
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.320]   would usually call them a pension account.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.240]   There are two types of pension there.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.000]   When you use the and both of them are pensions, there's what's called a defined contribution
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.960]   pension, which is where you're just putting in a same defined amount, a contribution each
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.520]   time.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.920]   And then there's a defined benefit pension.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.320]   And that's where you're guaranteed a certain amount out of it.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.440]   But they're both pensions.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.880]   And so the accounts that we use in the US, things like IRAs and 401ks, those are still
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.600]   pension accounts.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.840]   But most people don't think of them as that.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.440]   They usually think of the US pensions as defined benefits.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.000]   I'm going to get 3000 a month when I retire.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.440]   But the little loophole that came out was that we have two different types of defined
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.040]   contribution pensions.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.920]   And these are known as IRAs, individual retirement accounts, or Roth IRAs.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.720]   And they're also known as traditional 401ks and Roth 401ks.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:44.480]   And basically, one of the accounts, you go ahead and pay the tax now and you put the
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.520]   money into the account and then you leave the money alone.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.960]   And when you take it out at retirement, you never pay income tax on the gain.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.640]   And the other type of account, you defer the money now.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.320]   You don't pay any tax on it now.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.640]   But you pay all the tax in the future on the gain.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.240]   And the rule of taxes, income tax specifically, you're always going to pay tax.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.560]   You're either going to pay it now or you're going to pay it later.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.880]   And so that's the whole calculation you're running.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.960]   Is it better to pay it now or is it better to pay it later?
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.640]   So the difference between these is that in the US, they passed a law where you can actually
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.280]   convert your account from one type of account into another type of account.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.240]   And there used to be an income limitation on this.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.320]   But now that income limitation has gone away.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   And my theory is that the US government is broke and they need more tax revenue.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.440]   And that was why they passed it.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.600]   I don't know if it's true or not, but that's what it seems to me.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.440]   They're trying to encourage people to go ahead and pay income tax now instead of deferring
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.160]   it for the future.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.000]   But what has happened is many people have the opportunity to put money into a traditional
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.920]   401k, which is the same thing you have at jobs, or an IRA, these deferred contribution
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.800]   plans and pay no tax on it now while they're working.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.160]   So they're working, say, earning $100,000 a year as an engineer.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.200]   Then they're putting $20,000 a year into the account.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   And then they leave their engineering job.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.600]   And they've set aside a little bit of money in an external account.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.480]   They move to Mexico or they go travel the world full time.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.240]   And they don't need that much money.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.720]   Well, now their income has dropped to zero.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.240]   And in the United States, you can pick up a certain amount of income and still stay
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.080]   in the 0% tax bracket.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.960]   So then little by little, they start converting over some of the money from the traditional
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   account, which is where the tax is deferred, into the Roth account.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:31.040]   And by only doing that in, say, $10,000 increments, they can stay under the 0% tax limit.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.800]   Because when you convert it, you have to pay the income tax in the year of conversion.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.040]   But because they're not making any money, they're keeping it at a 0% rate.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.760]   Then by putting it over into the Roth account, they'll be able to use it in the future.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.000]   And this is compounded with a little rule, a little trick that the early retirees in
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.160]   the US system are using, where in a Roth IRA, you can always take out what's called your
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.040]   tax basis, the actual contributions into it, without paying any tax and without paying
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.760]   any penalties.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.560]   So even though it's a retirement account, you put in $5,000 this year and $5,000 next
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.720]   year, you've contributed $10,000.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.040]   That's what we call your basis in the account.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.560]   And the account's grown to be $12,000.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.880]   You can take out the $10,000 for any reason without paying penalties or tax.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.640]   But if you take out the $2,000 additional, you'd pay penalties and tax on that.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.840]   So what they do is that once you put the money into the Roth IRA and once you leave it alone
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.560]   for five years, then you can go ahead and take out the contributions without paying
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.320]   any tax or penalty.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.400]   And so people are putting money into their 401(k) during their working years.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.000]   They're pursuing early retirement.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.560]   Then they quit.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.520]   They go travel.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.560]   They start incrementally converting the money over into a Roth IRA, leaving it alone for
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:50.240]   five years, and then start taking out their basis at the age of, say, 48, 49 and taking
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.160]   that money income tax-free.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.960]   And then at 55 or 59, when they go ahead and start taking the distributions out, they can
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.880]   go ahead and take the gains out tax-free.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.400]   So that's the strategy that is available under the U.S. tax code.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.240]   And the two best resources, if listeners are interested in reading about that, there is
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:13.120]   a site called MADFientist, M-A-D-F as in Foxtrot, I-E-N-T-I-S-T.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.560]   That's written by a guy named Brandon.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.440]   He does a great job explaining this for U.S.-based people.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:23.520]   And there's also an excellent travel site by an author named Jeremy and his wife Winnie,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:30.080]   and they have a site called GoCurryCracker.com, GoCurryC-U-R-R-Y-Cracker.com.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.800]   And on that site, they go through details and actually show with their tax returns how
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.800]   they've employed this strategy for their early retirement perpetual travel lifestyle.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.280]   That's cool.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.480]   I actually interviewed them.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.280]   And so, yeah, that's a nice example.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.280]   And that makes it's really helpful you explaining it because that makes a lot more sense to me
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.640]   how people in the U.S. can pursue that approach.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.040]   I may be wrong on this, but I don't think that you can do quite the same thing in the
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:01.040]   U.K. because we do have the same basic structure in that you can either pay the tax now and
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:09.120]   then put your after-tax income in a tax-exempt savings account, which can grow without having
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:15.840]   tax on the interest, or you can defer the tax by putting your money into a retirement
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.040]   account or pension.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.680]   But then you can't switch them between the two, if you see what I mean, at least not
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.320]   that I know of.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:29.120]   But that actually means that for the employee who's pursuing early retirement in the States,
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.440]   that's a pretty important strategy to be able to use because otherwise a lot of your
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:40.400]   money gets locked up and it becomes a lot less flexible as to how and when you can access
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.480]   your money, which I believe is the case in the U.K.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.680]   Right.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.800]   It's extremely important.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.400]   Now, it does have downsides.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.640]   Every strategy has downsides.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.200]   And it's up to the individual to look at their individual strategy and just look at
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:58.400]   their individual investments and understand what are the risks and benefits, what are
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.360]   the upsides and downsides of this strategy in my life, and is this one going to be right
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:03.760]   for me.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.200]   But if somebody is an employee, because there are many benefits to being an employee, I
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.040]   often think what it would be like to just go and work a 40-hour-a-week job and leave
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.360]   my work there on Thursday night.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.720]   There are many benefits to it.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:22.640]   And the key is to understand what are the strategies that I can apply within my context
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.640]   that will help me get closer to my goals.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:32.160]   Well, I have another question about those deferred accounts, because as well as the
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.920]   question of how flexible they are, and it does sound like they're more flexible in the
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:42.480]   States, there is also the question of whether or not you have other risks using – putting
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.720]   a lot of your money into tax-deferred accounts.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.680]   And one of the risks that people talk about is the question of sovereign risk and the
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:55.200]   question of pension funds essentially being expropriated, which does happen.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.520]   It hasn't happened in the U.S. or the U.K. for a long time, or maybe I'm not even sure
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.960]   if it has happened in the past.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.520]   But it happens all over the world in places like Argentina and so forth.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:13.440]   And this is one of those risks that you either dismiss or you think is maybe a possibility
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.880]   or some people are very concerned about it.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.880]   What is your thought about that question?
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.520]   In my mind, the best answer is going to be a balance.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:31.360]   To me, to assume that tax law doesn't change and that governments don't change the law
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.920]   in order to suit their own purposes is simply naive.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:42.240]   On the other hand, to think that it's all a vast conspiracy of trying to strip each
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.240]   and every individual of all of their wealth, I haven't seen the evidence for that.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.440]   And even though I usually am drawn towards those kinds of theories, I want them – I
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.800]   want to see a little bit of evidence.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.160]   I am very concerned about this risk and I'm especially concerned about it in many of the
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.680]   large Western countries.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:07.040]   I do not see personally any possible way for the U.S. government specifically to be able
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.800]   to handle all of their obligations.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   And in the U.S., in the financial structure, the problems that the U.S. faces, it's not
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.480]   so much a current debt problem.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.360]   The U.S. government owes, depending on where you go, something like $18 trillion of
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.560]   direct debt.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.440]   But the problem is not the direct debt but rather what we call the unfunded liabilities
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.880]   of the social programs.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:36.160]   And this number, depending on whose number you go with, can be anywhere from $100 trillion
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.720]   to one professor that I think makes a lot of sense, a guy named Lawrence Kotlikoff at
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.920]   Boston University.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.200]   He estimates it to be over $220 trillion of total debt.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.880]   And so you look at that and the big problem in the U.S. is not actually the social security
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.640]   system, although that is a problem.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.040]   It's primarily the medical systems, Medicare and Medicaid, which are woefully underfunded.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.760]   And I look at it almost as from a perspective of political reality.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.320]   The political reality is that in general, politicians will usually promise as many benefits
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.200]   as they can and pay for as few as possible.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:15.680]   And this is why in the U.S. we have an epidemic of local municipalities, pension programs
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.440]   going completely kaput.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.880]   Because if you come in and you're working as a firefighter, it's very easy for the
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.480]   mayor and the town council to say, "We don't have a lot of money right now, so we're
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.960]   not going to pay you a high current salary.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.440]   But what we will do is we will fund this pension plan for you, and we'll pay you a
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.400]   very generous pension."
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.400]   And most firefighters that I had as clients and that were friends of mine primarily were
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.040]   working in order to gain their pension benefits.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.640]   And it's a great early retirement plan.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.640]   You go and you work for 20 years, then you retire and you get 80 percent of your take
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.040]   home pay from then on for the rest of your life.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.680]   And I worked with guys that were 44, 45 years old coming out of a 20-year career and getting
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:57.280]   paid almost $100,000 U.S. per year every year for the rest of their life.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.000]   And you look at that and say, "Wow, that's fantastic."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.320]   But the problem is, is that going to be paid?
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   Now it varies among municipalities, and this is the risk that we face in different countries.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.080]   The U.S. is different than Great Britain, and Great Britain is going to be different
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.080]   than Greece.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.160]   And there's no comparison between the Greek economy and the U.S. economy in the sense
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.600]   of they're not the same in almost any way except that there's a country and there's
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.000]   a national economy and politicians are politicians.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.680]   So I'm very concerned about that risk.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:29.720]   I personally see an even bigger risk to retirement accounts, and I'll tell you that one because
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.240]   to me that's the more applicable one that has me steering away from them in my own personal
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.660]   financial planning.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.960]   But I think it's an important risk and to just simply discard it is naive.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:46.040]   I would be uncomfortable planning on those accounts never changing their laws for the
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.640]   coming 50 to 75 years.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.460]   I wouldn't recommend to somebody, if I were coaching a client and this client is 50 years
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.720]   old and they have a lot of their wealth in 401(k)s, I wouldn't recommend that in the
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:01.260]   U.S. current situation that they freak out, sell everything, and move everything into
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.680]   gold coins.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.840]   But I wouldn't recommend that a 15-year-old put all of their faith and all of their plans
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.680]   into those types of accounts.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.960]   So in my mind it's a balance.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.720]   If you don't mind, let me just share the bigger risk that I see about these accounts.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.040]   Yeah, I was going to ask you what you think that is.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.120]   I think sovereign risk matters.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.840]   But to me, I think the bigger risk is lack of control of money.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.800]   And this was a major thing that I learned as a professional financial advisor.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.200]   When I was a personal finance junkie, every personal finance book I read, the path to
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.880]   wealth was simply this.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.120]   Go to college, get a job, and fully fund your retirement accounts and buy good mutual funds
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.480]   in those retirement accounts.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.920]   And I did that.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   The problem was I got to the point even a few years ago when I started Radical Personal
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   Finance where the majority of my savings was in retirement accounts and other tax-deferred
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.960]   accounts that I couldn't access immediately, funds that weren't fully liquid.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:01.720]   And I had other savings but then I made the mistake of buying a house and heavily putting
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.000]   much of my liquid savings into that house.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.400]   Now I thought it was a good decision at the time because I thought I was in a very stable
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.800]   situation.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.120]   And anybody who had known my financial plan at that time would have encouraged me to make
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.680]   the decision that I made.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.400]   But then all of a sudden, I found myself in a desire to start a business and I didn't
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.400]   have a lot of liquid cash.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.040]   Now when you combine my experience with my observation doing financial planning and I
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.640]   challenge each and every listener to go and look in their town and ask themselves this
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:35.240]   question, "Do you know anybody who became very wealthy and the foundation of their wealth
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:40.880]   was the fact that they fully funded their retirement plans from the age of 20 to the
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.280]   age of 60?"
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.760]   I know only one person like that.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.280]   And what I found was that it's very unusual.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.600]   Now many people have a lot of money in their retirement accounts.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.440]   Most of those people have a lot of money in their retirement accounts simply because they
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.360]   have a very high income.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.120]   And when you compare say somebody making $40,000 a year and how much money they can contribute
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:07.880]   to their account putting $400 a month aside versus somebody making $300,000 a year and
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:14.120]   setting aside $20,000 a year, the $300,000 a year earner is going to have a massive retirement
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.360]   account balance.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.200]   But it's not necessarily because of the account.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.760]   It's because they put $20,000 a year in savings.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.960]   And what I noticed is that if you go around my town and just about every town I've been
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:28.440]   in, the people who are wealthy are always the people who own the businesses of the town.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:33.560]   You know, the Joshua Sheets car dealership or the Joshua Sheets gas stations or the Jake
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.600]   DeSilis engineering company or insert whatever business it is here.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.880]   And I learned that business was the primary driver of wealth.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.120]   And if I put all my money into retirement accounts, that can work if I'm going to be
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.840]   an employee over a long period of time.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:53.060]   But it's a much faster path to financial independence to simply be an entrepreneur.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:59.100]   I live right now almost exactly the same lifestyle that I would be living if I were purely living
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.100]   on dividends.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:04.620]   I'm working more than I would be working if I were just living on dividends from an investment
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.620]   portfolio.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.620]   That is true.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:12.340]   But I would still be doing the same work that I'm doing now and I'd be living the same lifestyle.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:17.700]   I didn't need to wait 10 or 15 or 20 years and become a multimillionaire to build a lifestyle
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.340]   of financial independence.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:24.900]   I've built a business that funds my lifestyle, but in order to build a business, I need investment
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.900]   capital.
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.060]   And if it's all locked up in a retirement account and I don't have the money to go out
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.980]   and buy a microphone for my podcast or I don't have the money to go out and pay a web designer
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:39.080]   to design my website, etc., then I don't have my business and I'm stuck in the system.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.740]   And you go back to this question of intent and frankly, I don't know.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.900]   I could talk on, I've talked a lot about the history of retirement on my show.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.740]   I don't know what the intent was, but I will say this.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:59.140]   If I were trying to design a system in which the primary wealth was going to be accrued
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:04.680]   and accreted by the companies that are involved in the investment business and I were trying
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:11.020]   to design a system where people bought investments for as long as possible, thus allowing me
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:17.300]   to make money and yet never used those investments, I would design a system that looks very much
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.860]   like the retirement account system.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:25.260]   Because what happens in reality is people put all their money into it, all they have
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:30.500]   is a limited number of investments in most plans, the investment companies gain a lot
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.620]   of money off the fees of managing those investments, it all goes into the generalized markets around
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:41.300]   the world and those people cannot touch it for 40 years.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.820]   That's a pretty good system if your goal is to gain wealth.
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.740]   Now was that the intention?
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:50.500]   I don't know if it was the intention or not, but I guarantee that the people who were influential
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.880]   in getting those laws established and at least recognizing the opportunity, they saw the
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.920]   business potential because every business person that has an opportunity to rope in
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:06.220]   a consumer under some type of terms is going to keep that consumer a very long term customer
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:11.220]   with little ability to escape, every business person is going to see the benefit of that.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.220]   That is so interesting.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:18.180]   I really appreciate that perspective and I think that's a really important point because
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:23.940]   I was talking about locking your money up in a retirement account for a very long time
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:29.900]   being an issue just in terms of gaining access to your funds and you're talking about it
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:34.260]   even within the context of the states where there are some special ways that you may have
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.260]   a bit more flexibility than in the UK.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:40.940]   You still have less flexibility and that's still going to limit your opportunity to pursue
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:46.180]   other great opportunities in life like entrepreneurship and like the chance to start a business.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:51.060]   So I think that gives a really interesting perspective for people to think about the
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.840]   possible downsides and some of the things that you have to take into account.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.260]   As you said Joshua, everyone is going to have to make their own decision about this, but
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:04.060]   I do think that there are negative sides to locking your money up in that way that limit
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:09.500]   your opportunities and that's something that people need to be aware of too.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:14.700]   Having said that, I also had the advice – like I read the advice in Harry Brown's book about
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.940]   retirement accounts when he was talking about this sort of sovereign risk and the fact that
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.500]   some people are afraid of that.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.260]   His point was look, you can't be sure what's going to happen in the future.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.980]   Laws can change, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't take advantage of the opportunities
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:33.180]   that are available to you to minimize your taxes in any way that you can.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:36.180]   I personally consider that to be a good approach.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:41.800]   I think why not use whatever opportunities for deductions that you have and opportunities
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.060]   for deferring taxes if you can.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:49.140]   Yes, it's true in the future the laws might change and you may not be able to use them,
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.140]   but I think it's sensible to take advantage of things that you can take advantage of if
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.860]   they're available now.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:59.100]   The best thing that I try to do on my show is to pull the emotion out of the decision
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.240]   because what happened for me was I spent so many years reading personal finance books
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.900]   and they said never cash out your retirement account, never touch your retirement account,
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.340]   never touch your retirement account.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:14.060]   For me, it almost became almost a religious idea in the sense of you never touch your
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.580]   retirement account, but it was a religious idea without any actual fundamental basis
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.620]   and truth.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:23.260]   It was just simply an emotional idea of don't touch your retirement account and the reality
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:29.660]   is if you simply pull back from the emotion of it and you look at it as opportunities
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:34.860]   and advantages and disadvantages, you can create a list of the benefits and the pros
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:40.640]   and the cons of actually of the contribution to the retirement account.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:45.180]   One of the potential disadvantages is the sovereign risk, but one of the potential advantages
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.260]   is the deferral on tax and you can measure that risk.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:54.060]   I perceive the current risk based upon the political reality under today's world in the
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:59.220]   US to be pretty low, but I'm not sure about that 30 years from now because political situations
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:03.160]   can change, but if you flip it around and recognize, okay, what's the alternative use
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.460]   of the dollar and this is what most people don't think about.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.540]   The fundamental most important concept I think people need to grasp with financial planning
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.500]   is the concept of opportunity cost.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.500]   I did a show on it.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:17.140]   It's one of my most popular shows about how opportunity cost influences everything and
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:22.980]   some practical examples of this would be if you were trying to decide between the age
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:28.700]   at the age of say 18, you're trying to decide whether to put a thousand dollars into a retirement
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.900]   account or to take that thousand dollars and to pursue an educational opportunity which
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:37.820]   is actually going to result in a substantial increase in your earning ability.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:43.060]   So whether that's a class, a certification, a university degree of some type that has
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:48.500]   a specific applicable financial outcome and you were trying to measure the benefit of
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.860]   investing the thousand dollars in the retirement account or investing the thousand dollars
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:58.180]   in your education, you would be able to come up with which one is better and I think almost
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:03.100]   every time it would be better to invest that thousand dollars into education and knowledge
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.540]   that's going to lead to higher earning potential.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:11.160]   Now if you're comparing investing that thousand dollars in the retirement account versus consuming
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.100]   the thousand dollars which is the situation that most people are in, it's either I put
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.340]   the money in my retirement account or I spend all my money.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:22.780]   Well, in that situation, you would be better off going ahead and investing the thousand
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:23.780]   dollars.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:28.140]   If you, Jake DeSilis, were going to go back and you were going to recreate your financial
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.140]   life and you were going to compare the amount of money and the amount of sweat equity that
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.700]   you put into building your business and you were going to put the same amount of money
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.860]   into a retirement account, you came out far ahead with building the business.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.540]   And so for you, it was better to build the business than to put the money into the retirement
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.540]   account.
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:49.300]   But that switched once you became the employee and you said, "Now I've got this high income.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.400]   I've got this asset that I don't know what the terms of your payout were but it was either
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.460]   deferred or it's being paid out over time.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.900]   I don't need all this income right now because I have low lifestyle expenses.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.920]   Now the retirement account is a good fit."
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:05.060]   So removing the emotion from it and then comparing and saying what's the actual tax benefit versus
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.620]   tax cost.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:11.740]   For example, if you're 18 years old and you're making say $20,000 a year, you're not paying
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.740]   much tax.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:18.500]   And in that situation, deferring the tax from today at a 0% tax rate to the future when
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.580]   you're going to have millions of dollars, there's not much of a reason to fund that
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.860]   kind of account if you can find a better place to invest it.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:25.860]   Absolutely.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.660]   That's all for this week's episode.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:32.300]   In next week's episode, we'll have the second part of the interview with Joshua.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:36.700]   In that part of the interview, we talk more about entrepreneurs and the question of tax
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.180]   strategy for entrepreneurs.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.780]   As always with financial topics, it's your responsibility what you do with your money
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:46.640]   and this is meant as food for thought and not as advice.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.260]   So do your own research and make a decision that works for you.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.300]   But I hope you found the discussion helpful.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:56.220]   We'll be back next week with another episode.
