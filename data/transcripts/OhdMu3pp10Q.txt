[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, the Protestant Reformation was a recovery of the pulpit,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.500]   and yet 500 years later, there are ways Protestant preachers unwittingly fail to honor the Bible in the pulpit.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.000]   Which leads to today's question from an anonymous church leader who writes this,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.500]   "Pastor John, I'm on a staff at a church, and over the past couple of months, I have noticed a trend in my pastor's preaching.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.500]   Let me first say that nothing he says would ever be considered wrong.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.500]   He uses points from the overarching themes of Scripture in his sermons.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:45.000]   Bottom line, he preaches the truth, but those points rarely derive from the sermon text he reads at the beginning of his message.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Is this a problem? What's at stake? And is this a common phenomenon or an anomaly?"
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.500]   The answer to those three questions is, number one, it is a problem. Number two, it's far too common, tragically.
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.500]   And number three, what's at stake are at least these six things.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:14.000]   Number one, preaching that does not show the people what the text meant and what those implications are for our lives
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   is failing to honor the nature of the text as God's glorious revelation of what we need to know and how it relates to our life.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It's failing to honor the text.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And he is failing to honor the people in the congregation who should be shown, by preaching,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   how they themselves can see glorious truth from the text that is relevant for their lives.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.500]   Paul said in Ephesians 3, 4, "By reading, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ."
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:05.500]   Preaching that is heralding the fruit of reading that sees the mystery of Christ in the text and helps others see it is real preaching.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:17.500]   That's what preaching is. It is the heralding of the fruit of reading that sees the mystery of Christ in the text and helps other people see how we saw it.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:29.000]   Pastors who don't preach this way are missing the thrill of being an instrument in the hands of God to help people actually see for themselves
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   the glories of the mysteries of Christ and their relevance to life.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Number two, preachers that don't exalt over the exposition of what they've seen in the biblical texts are bearing witness either,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.500]   one, to their own laziness because they haven't taken the time to see it, or two, their dullness because they're not able to see it,
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.000]   or three, their own emotional incapacities because they see it and they can't feel anything special about it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So why would they talk about it? Are they going to make up things that they feel special about?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   This is not something to be proud of. This is not a token of creativity. These are weaknesses that need to be corrected, overcome.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   We should pray for our pastors earnestly that the laziness or the dullness or the emotional incapacities would be overcome.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   In other words, this is not only unhealthy for the church, it is deeply an unhealthy sign for the pastor.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Number three, to preach by making points that hover above the text and are not manifestly rooted in the text,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   manifestly rooted, very important word, manifestly, obviously rooted to the congregation, rooted,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   diminishes the authority of the passage and the authority of the message.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Because the only authority that a pastor has derives from his faithful delivery of God's word.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It doesn't come from himself. The more difficulty, this is important, take note,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   the more difficulty the people have in seeing the pastor's points in the text,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   the less warrant they have for believing what he says.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Wow.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Because it's the text that has final decisive authority.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   If they can't see what he's saying in the text, there's no warrant why they should believe him or the situation may be worse.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The pastor may in fact want to shift authority, want to shift authority from the text to himself
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   and thus enlarge his own personal power that nobody can really question because he has shifted authority from the word,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   which everybody has access to, to himself, which nobody can question.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Oh, I love leadership rooted in the council room and in the pulpit with the pastor saying,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   I am not the decisive final authority. The word is anybody that can see the word more clearly than I can correct me.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Number four, a pastor who preaches by making points that are not manifestly in the text is preparing his people for biblical and doctrinal defections in the days to come.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   If the people become accustomed to making their biblical and doctrinal judgments about what is true and right and beautiful,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   based on the declarations of a man rather than based on what they see in scripture,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   these folks will, as Ephesians 4.14 says, be blown off course by the various winds of doctrines that blow in our culture.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Number five, to put it slightly differently, almost the same as number four,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   a pastor who preaches without drawing attention to the details of the wording of the text as the warrant for his points
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   will train the people to be careless and inattentive to the specificities of the moral and spiritual claims of scripture on their lives.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   This produces a people, I've seen it, this produces a people who are loose and careless in their moral judgments.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   They have become accustomed to generalities and vagueness, and generalities and vagueness on tough moral issues produce wishy-washy saints
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   who do not have the backbone and the specific insights to stand up for the specific teachings of scripture regarding controversial matters.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Finally, number six, this kind of preaching that makes its points without clear warrant from the specific wording of the text
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   robs the people of a kind of joy that Jesus intends for them to have when he says in John 15.11,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   "I have said these things, I've spoken these things, these things are written, that my joy might be in you and that your joy might be full."
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   That text does not mean that the incomparable divine joy in the heart of Jesus Christ will become our joy
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   because of the pastor's interesting comments about important things in the world that are not manifest expressions of the intention of Jesus when he spoke.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   His words with his meaning will impart his joy. So yes, the stakes are very high when a pastor regularly builds his message with points that are not plainly from the actual wording and intention of the text.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Wow, well if it sounds like Pastor John has been thinking about preaching a lot lately, you'd be right.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   He has just finished writing his next book which releases on April 6th of next year, 2018.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   It's an all new book, all new content, all about preaching and it's titled "Expository Exaltation, Christian Preaching as Worship"
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   which is due out from Crossway again April 6th, 2018 is the pub date.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It's the capstone volume, the third in a trilogy that began with "A Peculiar Glory" which was released in the spring of 2016
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   and that was followed by "Reading the Bible Supernaturally" which was released in the spring of 2017
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and now finally "Expository Exaltation" releasing in the spring of 2018.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   If you want to understand John Piper's theology, read his first trilogy which is "Desiring God", "The Pleasures of God" and "Future Grace".
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   But if you want to understand the inner workings of Pastor John's views of scripture and its authority
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   and then how he reads the Bible and finally how he preaches the Bible, you'll want to read this newer trilogy
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   "A Peculiar Glory", "Reading the Bible Supernaturally" and now the capstone "Expository Exaltation" launching in April.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   It is a treasure of a trilogy.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Well, thanks again for listening to the podcast. My name is Tony Reinke and we will see you back here on Friday.
