[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   So, Someday, it's a book stirring in me, is the art of thinking, and how to use that
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.880]   kind of process and go deeper into it.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.880]   And I talked a lot about it in one of my podcasts, which might be the seed of a book.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.280]   But it's the difference between dead thinking and alive thinking.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.320]   Ideas can be either alive or they can be dead.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.040]   An alive idea is something that enters your brain from an external source, a philosopher,
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.120]   an article, somebody you admire, somebody you hate.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.520]   And then you absorb it, and you think about it, and you decide, I'm going to turn it around
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.720]   into this, and I'm going to make it alive and make it something that's part of me.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.980]   Another part of an alive idea is you have an idea that comes to you about a book or
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.540]   a project or something about the world, and you go, maybe that's not actually true.
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.840]   Maybe the opposite is true.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.920]   And you go through a process, and you cycle through it on and on, and you reflect on it,
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.600]   and you refine this idea.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.720]   And maybe it turns into its opposite.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.640]   And through the process of reflecting and correcting and revising it, you turn it into
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.240]   something living, something alive within you, on and on and on.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.480]   And what prevents people from going through that process, which would be the subject of
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.040]   my book, is basically anxiety.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.000]   Because I think how you handle anxiety is the most important kind of quality in life.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.200]   It will determine whether you will be successful, whether you will find your career path, or
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.240]   whether you won't be able to.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.040]   I don't know if you can follow that idea at all.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.000]   But anxiety is a signal to you that you don't understand something, that there's a problem
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.080]   out there that you can't resolve.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.680]   And so what happens to most people, if you're insecure, is you glom onto something instant
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.360]   and easy to get rid of your feeling of anxiety.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.560]   I don't understand this problem.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   Oh, it must be A. A must be the answer, because this person said that, right?
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.080]   And so you don't develop the ability to think.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.520]   You don't develop the ability to go to the next level.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.200]   But if you take that anxiety, and you go, all right, maybe A is an answer.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.920]   And then you start going through A, and then you go, no, maybe A isn't the answer.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.440]   Maybe B is the answer.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.760]   You're able to surmount your anxiety and go past it, come further and further and further.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.160]   You don't rush for the first available answer that's out there, right?
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.200]   You're able to go through a process of refining things.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.440]   And so in your career, if you're anxious for success, if you're anxious for money, you're
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.640]   going to make the wrong choices.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.120]   But if you're able to deal with that anxiety and say, maybe I have to think more deeply
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120]   about where I'm going.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.120]   I have to come up with other alternatives, then you're going to make a much better choice
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.000]   on and on and on.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.480]   So if you're a creative person, it's very, very challenging to have that blank piece
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.400]   of paper before you, that book that you haven't written, that film or whatever.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.160]   You're filled with a lot of anxiety, and you have to deal with it.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.840]   And if you're able to turn it into something creative and productive, then great things
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   will happen.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.400]   You'll create a masterpiece.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.760]   So the ability to deal with anxiety and to not give in to the most instant gratification
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.800]   that you can get is to me a marker of somebody who will be creative and will invent something
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.840]   as opposed to people who just recycle old and dead ideas.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.360]   Amen to that.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.120]   I was once told that anxiety makes children of us all, and not in the positive sense of
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.440]   being childlike.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.840]   It regresses us to a mode where we feel a complete lack of control.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.320]   And I completely agree that being able to manage anxiety and dance with it, since we
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.240]   can't rid ourselves of it, perhaps nor should we, right?
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.600]   Because it's a signal, as you point out, that we don't understand something, that there's
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.920]   something to get curious about, a process or something out there, or both.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.840]   I think that really resonates.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.660]   I think a lot of people will benefit from hearing that, because I think we hear the
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.760]   word flow, and we just all imagine, I even catch myself imagining that when Robert Greene
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.560]   sits down to write, it's like there's a blank sheet, and then he just kind of meditates,
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.600]   and then boom, out come these books.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.560]   But if I get realistic for a second, I'm sure that there's a lot of inner turmoil and anxiety.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.640]   Oh my God, you have no idea.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:40.080]   So my process is 95% pain, and maybe 2.5% ecstasy, and I don't know what the other 2.5%
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.280]   would be.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.200]   So I write a story, because in my new book, and most of my books, I always begin with
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.080]   the story from history, et cetera, and it is so bad.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   I can't believe how bad, how flat it is, how it sucks.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.480]   I'm so embarrassed, I hate myself, and I go and I dig into it, and I start changing the
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   words in it.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.120]   I start making it a little bit better.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.160]   The second version, it's kind of palatable, but it still sucks.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.640]   If I let it out into the world, it'd be very embarrassing.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.440]   It's anxious, and my wife can tell you, I'm a miserable being when that happens.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.160]   Everything looks black to me at that point, and I push through it.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.840]   So if I gave in to my anxiety, and this happens with a lot of books and writers, I would just
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.560]   put out that second version, which isn't very good.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.880]   It isn't very strong.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.560]   It isn't thought through, because my ideas, when I look at them the first time, I go,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.560]   that's not real.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.720]   That's not the actual thing that's going on here, Robert.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.200]   You've missed the mark.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.240]   You want to hit what's actually real in that story.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.560]   So you have to go deeper and deeper and harder and harder and harder.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.240]   So I don't just give up and go, here's the chapter.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.160]   I go, it's got to be better.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:01.480]   It's got to be better, until finally, after two months of struggling, it seems like it's
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.840]   gone to the place that I want it to be in, right?
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.880]   But I use that anxiety to keep improving and making it better.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.960]   And then when I reach that point, and the story is good enough, and I can let my wife
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.320]   read it, and then my editor, I feel great.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.680]   I have that 2% moment of joy.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.360]   But it came through all of that anxiety.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.400]   But I can tell you, the feeling of fulfillment when I finish a chapter is pretty damn great.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.440]   When I finish a book, it's better than any kind of drug experience anyone could ever
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.440]   have.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.800]   It's such a wonderful feeling of accomplishment and pushing past all the barriers.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.360]   So my process involves a lot of anxiety.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:54.880]   That's why I'm talking about it, and why I want to write a book about it.
