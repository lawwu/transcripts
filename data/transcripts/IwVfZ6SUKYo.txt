[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.860]   - The following sermon excerpt may be the most spread excerpt
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.280]   in all of John Piper's preaching legacy.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.240]   It contains phrases and sentences and images
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.360]   that have become emblems of his ministry.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.520]   The clip is taken from a message titled,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.000]   "Boasting Only in the Cross," which he preached outdoors
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.840]   to about 20,000 college students
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.120]   at Passion's One Day Conference on May 20th, 2000.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.520]   Here's what John Piper said.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.080]   - You don't have to know a lot of things
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.880]   in order to make a huge difference
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.300]   for the Lord in the world.
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.160]   But you do need to know a few things that are great
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.540]   and be willing to live for them and die for them.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.140]   People that make a difference in the world
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.080]   are not people who have mastered a lot of things.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.620]   They are people who have been mastered by a very few things
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.580]   that are very, very great.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.700]   If you want your life to count,
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.180]   you don't have to have a high IQ
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.500]   and you don't have to have a high EQ.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.140]   You don't have to be smart.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.620]   You don't have to have good looks.
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.180]   You don't have to be from a good family
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.180]   or from a good school.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.000]   You just have to know a few basic,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.600]   simple, glorious, majestic,
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.400]   obvious, unchanging, eternal things
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.260]   and be gripped by them
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.340]   and be willing to lay down your life for them,
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.300]   which is why anybody in this crowd
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.760]   can make a worldwide difference,
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.200]   'cause it isn't you.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.760]   It's what you're gripped with.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.940]   But one of the really sad things
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.440]   about this moment right now
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.940]   is that there are hundreds of you in this crowd
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.860]   who do not want your life to make a difference.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.520]   All you want is to be liked.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.020]   Maybe finish school,
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.020]   get a good job,
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.380]   find a husband or a wife,
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.500]   a nice house, a nice car,
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.380]   good vacations,
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.140]   grow old healthy,
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.660]   have a fun retirement,
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.220]   die easy, no hell,
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.540]   and that's all you want.
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.820]   You don't give a rip
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.480]   whether your life counts on this earth for eternity.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.760]   That's a tragedy in the making.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.720]   That is a tragedy in the making.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.520]   About three weeks ago,
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.840]   we got news at our church
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.440]   that Ruby Eliason
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.320]   and Laura Edwards were killed in Cameroon.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.600]   Ruby Eliason,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.680]   over 80,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.080]   single all her life,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.480]   a nurse,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.040]   poured her life out for one thing,
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.760]   to make Jesus Christ known
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.600]   among the sick and the poor
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.800]   in the hardest and most unreached places.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.320]   Laura Edwards,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.360]   a medical doctor in the Twin Cities
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.720]   and then in retirement,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.320]   partnering up with Ruby,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.120]   also pushing 80,
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.440]   and going from village to village in Cameroon.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.280]   And the brakes give way.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.480]   Over a cliff they go,
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.880]   and they're dead instantly.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.680]   And I asked my people,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.160]   is this a tragedy?
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.960]   Two women,
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.920]   in their 80s,
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.240]   a whole life devoted to one idea,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.400]   Jesus Christ magnified
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.560]   among the poor and the sick
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.640]   in the hardest places.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.200]   And 20 years after most of their American counterparts
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.000]   had begun to throw their lives away
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.400]   on trivialities in Florida and New Mexico,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   fly into eternity with a death in a moment,
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.520]   is this a tragedy, I asked.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.520]   It is not a tragedy.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.600]   I'll read you what a tragedy is.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.180]   I've got a little article here from Reader's Digest.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.600]   You don't read Reader's Digest, I know that.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.240]   Title of the article,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.480]   Start Now, Retire Early,
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.720]   February 1998.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.120]   Bob and Penny took early retirement
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.000]   from their jobs in the Northeast five years ago
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.840]   when he was 59 and she was 51.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.480]   Now they live in Punta Gorda, Florida,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.960]   where they cruise on their 30-foot trawler,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.960]   play softball, and collect shells.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.160]   That's a tragedy.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.600]   That's a tragedy and there are people in this country
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.480]   that are spending billions of dollars
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.920]   to get you to buy it.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.960]   And I get 40 minutes to plead with you,
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.360]   don't buy it.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.600]   With all my heart, I plead with you,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.480]   don't buy that dream.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.560]   The American dream.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.400]   A nice house, a nice car,
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.240]   a nice job, a nice family,
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.240]   a nice retirement, collecting shells.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.800]   As the last chapter,
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.200]   before you stand before the creator of the universe
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.960]   to give an account with what you did,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.100]   here it is, Lord, my shell collection.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.960]   Look, Lord, my shell collection.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.120]   And I've got a good swing.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   And look at my boat.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.840]   God, look at my boat, God.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:38.360]   Well, not for Ruby and not for Laura.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.380]   Don't waste your life, don't waste it.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.480]   - Classic, that was a clip from John Piper's message,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.440]   boasting only in the cross at Passions One Day Conference,
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.160]   recorded outdoors on May 20th, 2000.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.240]   You can find the entire message on our website.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.360]   In fact, you can now see the entire video
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.120]   of the message as well.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.680]   And on a related note, check out John Piper's book,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.320]   "Don't Waste Your Life."
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.720]   You can download it free of charge
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.480]   from our website, desiringgod.org.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.400]   He looks at a number of these similar themes.

[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.560]   and then click on the title, "Don't Waste Your Life."
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.280]   We're back tomorrow and I'll ask John Piper,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.720]   "What are the dangers of being overly nostalgic?
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.640]   "How do we rightly or wrongly prioritize the past?"
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.920]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
