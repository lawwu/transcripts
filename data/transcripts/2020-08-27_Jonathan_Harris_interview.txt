[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.880]   - Thank you, glad to be here.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.040]   - It's been, what, four years, probably five years,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.680]   something like that, since you were last on the show?
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.800]   I don't remember exactly,
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.360]   but I know that you have been on the show before
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.200]   where we talked about homeschooling.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.040]   - Maybe five years.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.640]   - Yeah, it's been significant.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.160]   - Yeah, I think five years.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.200]   - And so I wanted to invite you back today
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.560]   to talk about home education,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.940]   talk about some of your experiences with home education.
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.960]   And I think that you are uniquely positioned
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.920]   to talk about home education.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.800]   Unlike many parents who this year,
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.820]   due to all the school shutdowns for COVID,
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.840]   unlike many parents who find themselves homeschooling
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.040]   for the first time, you've been doing this for quite a while.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.320]   And not only that, but you've got children at every stage.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.080]   Your eldest is how old now?
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.760]   - My oldest is 22 now.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.120]   - Okay, 22, and your youngest is?
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.880]   - My youngest is four.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.920]   - Okay. - Four.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.520]   - And you've homeschooled all your children
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.360]   on the way through. - So the last time
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.200]   I talked to you, yeah, the last time I talked to you,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.960]   my youngest would not have even been born yet.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   So, yeah, that's quite a span, actually.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.400]   - It is. - Of ages.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.200]   So I feel like we've moved from one decade of homeschooling
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.240]   into a new era of homeschooling.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.000]   The trends move and you don't see it from year to year,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.360]   but then when you look back and try to remember
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.120]   your youngest one, how you were doing it
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.560]   more than 10 years ago, and it's like,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.120]   wow, things have changed.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.200]   - Right, right.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.480]   Well, I think this is really useful
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.540]   because I admire you.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.520]   I've admired you for quite a while.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.920]   When I first had you on the show before,
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.520]   you were talking about 10K to Talent.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.480]   That was your brand at that time.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.200]   You and your wife were starting a new brand
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.840]   where you're just adjusting 10K to Talent
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.480]   into something called Parent Their Passion,
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.720]   which we'll talk about.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.440]   But when I first got to know you
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.600]   and I first got to know some of what you were doing,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.400]   I started watching your children,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   watching what you were doing
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.680]   and how you were helping your children to learn.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.880]   And I've admired that a lot of ways.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.480]   - You know, and I have a four-year-old
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.680]   who's managed to get through two layers of protection
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.640]   to find me.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.280]   She's being whisked away.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.320]   So it's real.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.840]   I really do have small children.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.200]   - Yeah, I've got dogs that bark at the neighbors
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.360]   whenever I'm doing this.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.120]   So you've been doing this for a while,
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.000]   but you've done a really good job, I think,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.440]   of making schooling relevant.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.760]   And that's one of the things that I most admire
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.360]   about what you've done with your homeschooling.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.960]   And so I'd like you to start by sharing with me,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   if you were asked to describe your family's philosophy
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.660]   about home education, how would you describe it?
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   - The approach we take is that we're trying to find a way
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.980]   to expand the child into a future that makes sense for them.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.980]   And what I mean by that is,
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.020]   when we first started off homeschooling,
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.300]   we had great success.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.140]   We're following much more of a traditional approach
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.140]   as far as filling up buckets of knowledge,
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.460]   which in and of itself is not bad.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.500]   And we still do that to a certain extent.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.540]   You know, you start off, you say,
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.780]   okay, we're in fifth grade.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.220]   We wanna know this kind of math.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.620]   We wanna know this kind of history,
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.380]   and maybe we'll throw in some extracurricular activities
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.100]   so we're not just sitting, you know,
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.180]   reading and moving around a bit.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.460]   And we might throw in a hobby,
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.700]   but it's really in that sense,
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.260]   centered around trying to accumulate
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.420]   in certain buckets of knowledge.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.440]   And then we gradually switched to being more focused
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.440]   on developing an education that was looking to the future,
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.040]   that made sense for each individual child.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.840]   So we're not talking really about tutoring.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.280]   That's a separate issue.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.400]   Tutoring is more, you know,
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.960]   you wanna fill up this bucket of knowledge
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.760]   so you might hire a specialist to go a little bit faster
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.240]   so you can accelerate.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.000]   But what we are really doing now
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   is we're focused on having them create a kind of talent
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.840]   that they can bring value to other people in the longterm.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.200]   So kind of create an identity for them
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.800]   that makes sense far beyond high school.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.920]   - Do you think of, when you use the word talent,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.460]   do you think of that primarily in an employment perspective?
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.720]   How does that, 'cause,
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.480]   so if we talk about like the philosophy of school,
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.960]   you think about what we usually think of as school.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.700]   We think of school,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.240]   that school is supposed to position us to,
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.880]   position us for the real world, right?
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.640]   The idea is we're studying
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.440]   so that we're prepared for the real world.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.400]   Now, there are different roads that we could go down.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.440]   Practical skills, employment skills,
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.160]   versus say the life of the mind.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.520]   So when you use talent,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.840]   are you primarily thinking about
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.000]   how that interacts with employment,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.140]   or is there something else?
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.520]   - Both, actually.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.160]   So especially for guys, I think that's really important.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.600]   As all men know,
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.400]   and sometimes wives can get a little depressed about that,
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.040]   but identities as men are so much wrapped up
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.980]   in what we do for a living
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.200]   that it becomes really important.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.520]   So it's a combination of both.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.980]   But a talent can also mean something that has real value
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.960]   that you wanna bring to other people
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.040]   that's not academically based,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.280]   but you're bringing,
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   you're creating a real impact on people
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.840]   with developed skills.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.400]   So a lot of times, as you get older,
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.240]   especially in the early 20s that I have noticed,
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.320]   people may be successful in academics or not,
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.560]   and then when they're outside of the controlled,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.040]   artificial environment of a high school, let's say,
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.080]   then reality hits home.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.340]   You may have some aspirations,
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.080]   but then you realize you're stuck flipping burgers
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080]   'cause you need the money,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.400]   or you're back doing another six years of schooling
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.080]   when you thought you were finally out of that phase.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.680]   Or you may wanna help,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.880]   in fact, we had a discussion recently
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.280]   with one of our older teenagers
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.760]   that wanted to do a little more
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.760]   of a kind of charity service.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.000]   And as he was calling around,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.200]   he quickly found out that really,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.640]   if you wanted to have an impact
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.340]   because these charity services were quite developed,
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.760]   you had to have some kind of skillset
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.120]   that they could use, right?
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.040]   So let's say you wanted to go help a family
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.920]   work on the remodel of their house.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.000]   If you don't know how to do a deck or fix a roof,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.040]   really, what are you gonna do?
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.360]   Sweep around the house?
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.240]   They already got that under control.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.920]   And I think as people get older,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.920]   they realize doing pity service activities
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.840]   don't really cut it.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.840]   So what I mean by talent is either and/or both,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   you develop a set of skillsets
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.360]   that can really take you in your career somewhere,
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.720]   so it gives you the freedom to do the things you wanna do,
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.160]   or you're gonna use it as an act of service of some kind,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.000]   but you really need to develop that part
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.120]   to really have an impact.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.120]   If not, you're not really making much of an impact.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.440]   - Tell us some of the stories
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.320]   of your elder children's talents
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.400]   and what they've been able to do with those talents
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.160]   as you've helped them develop them.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.320]   - Yeah, so there are four kids out of the house right now,
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.760]   22 down to 18, so I got a 22-year-old,
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.160]   and I have a 20-year-old, no, 21, he just turned 21,
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.160]   so 21, and a set of twins, a boy, girl,
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.480]   and they're 18, and they're living and working on their own,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.280]   and they are all using the skills and talents
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.480]   that they've developed deliberately
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.960]   throughout their high school years
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.440]   in combination with their schooling.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.480]   And the oldest right now,
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.840]   he works on various big contract jobs
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   that involve civilian drone work,
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.760]   usually for surveying special kind of equipments
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.760]   across the country, and he uses a lot of videography,
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.360]   he manages people, and that's something
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.920]   that he started back when he was in our home.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.480]   He started helping us out with our photography
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.320]   for our home business, a completely separate home business,
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.480]   and we got him involved with our,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.160]   I think our first digital camera at the time,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.440]   and we needed to take more pictures
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.080]   of what we were selling, and so I was thinking,
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.440]   why don't we use him and put him to work on it?
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.000]   So he started helping us in that area,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.660]   and then over time, one thing led to another,
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.660]   and we met a friend who was one of the early drone adopters
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.000]   for civilian use, and he gave him one of his older models,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.600]   and then he decided, hey, I could do this
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.520]   for real estate filming, and one thing led to another,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.160]   and he just kept developing that,
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.440]   and eventually started getting work across the country,
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.800]   which he absolutely loved.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.960]   He loves to travel, specifically,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.120]   he loves to see the wilderness in different areas,
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.520]   and the kind of work that he does often involves
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.040]   surveying equipment in remote locations
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.860]   for big companies that will contract with people like him.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.080]   And then I have my 21-year-old,
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.680]   and we originally started,
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.800]   by the time I got to my second born,
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.920]   this philosophy, this method was really full-blown
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.520]   by that time, I had started experimenting
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.640]   with my first born, and by the time I got to the second one,
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.520]   I think I'd kind of figured out most of the kinks,
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.520]   and that way, locally, we have a gem and mineral club,
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.160]   which is very unusual, this particular club
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   is very unusual because it was the center
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.880]   for a lot of the old gold rush days,
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.160]   and the equipment, over the years,
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.520]   I don't know, it's been around for 80 years, longer,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.520]   I'm not even sure, and as the older guys pass on,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.400]   whatever, they'll give their equipment to this club,
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.520]   there's a lot of people who know firsthand
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.320]   about mineral deposits and rock formations and stuff,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.120]   and they love having young kids join in there
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.300]   and show 'em how to cut stones and things like that,
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.600]   so we started going there, I didn't have any knowledge
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.880]   in that area, but my son was absolutely fascinated by that.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.000]   That eventually led to him doing some metal work,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.080]   because there was some metal work related to this skill set,
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.920]   and then from there, he got fascinated by making blades,
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.060]   he got very, very good at it, and when he left our home,
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.280]   he was still selling custom blades, Japanese blades,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.240]   he loved to make those, he got very good,
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.320]   they were beautiful, it was beautiful work,
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.720]   and then he decided he, well, actually, I gotta get that back,
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.240]   no, then he went for a custom knife builder,
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.040]   and then from there, he decided he really wanted,
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.840]   he loved the machinery that they were using
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.880]   to make some precision parts for it,
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.880]   and then he decided he really wanted to go into CNC work
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.800]   or machining work, high-end machining work,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.360]   and he was able to get an interview,
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.520]   I think he cold-called them, by then,
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.040]   he was already out of our home,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.640]   working and paying for his own stuff,
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.200]   and because of his background and his passion
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.520]   and determination, he also had a great portfolio,
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.200]   he documented everything, so he was an early adopter
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.280]   on Instagram, showing all his work and how he learned,
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.720]   all that stuff opened up the doors,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.280]   and when he came to one of these big shops
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.720]   that would be very hard to get into,
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.480]   they gobbled him up right away,
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.020]   and at this point in time, he's just absolutely loving it.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.700]   So the other two, I have a coder,
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.400]   and he's almost a stereotypical coder,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:42.360]   with all the precision and some of the social skills
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.120]   that go with that, absolutely fascinated
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.240]   by how things work logically,
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.320]   and he was helping us in our business,
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.200]   the same thing a bit, he started getting
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.880]   onto some of these gaming sites,
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.320]   working just on the development side of it,
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.200]   and learning how to manage other programmers,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.920]   at, I don't know, he was 17 or 16,
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.720]   and the beauty of that, and that will come up
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.600]   probably later, is that a lot of these skills
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.400]   you can do without people knowing your actual age,
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.360]   I mean, they know they're young,
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.240]   but they don't know how young you are,
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.180]   so if you can perform and deliver, they don't care,
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.420]   and I can tell you, that really boosts people's confidence,
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.240]   I mean, my child's confidence.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.400]   He's on his own, he's working full-time,
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.680]   he just codes from morning 'til night,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.480]   we're trying to encourage him to develop
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.660]   some more hobbies on the side,
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.400]   so he's not always doing his talent,
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   because he just loves it, and I think he's picking up,
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.800]   he likes taking apart motorcycles now,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.260]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.860]   We have, the next after that, is our daughter,
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.920]   and she's always been super artistic,
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.080]   she started down the artistic path in the beginning,
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.680]   not because we had a particular talent goal for her
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.500]   at that time, but she had great difficulty reading,
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.200]   very serious reading problem,
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.640]   we tried out everything we could,
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.000]   and so at that time, as parents, we decided,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.440]   you know what, we didn't want her to be constantly
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.100]   frustrated, and we decided we wanted to develop
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.940]   some kind of talent that she could look forward
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.900]   to doing during the day, and we,
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.660]   that was, she was one of the key people,
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.340]   and the children here, who helped me to understand
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.340]   that really, you could really use your talent
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.320]   to actually hijack your curriculum,
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.980]   and so a lot of the time, she had difficulty
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.560]   reading, let's say, a history lesson,
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.820]   without a lot of help from someone else,
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.120]   she has no problem now, but at that time, she did,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.700]   and so we just started encouraging her,
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.180]   well, let's get some more books that show accurate
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.380]   illustrations of the time period of what's going on,
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.540]   and we encouraged her to kind of draw her way
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.620]   through history, draw her way through all sorts of things,
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.660]   and she, her talent just kept building,
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.260]   and building, and building, and eventually,
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.140]   that became kind of her identity.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   Fast forward, she is, she has two part-time jobs right now,
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.120]   even during the lockdowns, and one is related
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.680]   to restaurant work, which has been good for her,
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.080]   a lot of social skills she's picked up there,
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.680]   and another one is actually related to her art skills,
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.000]   and so there's a company that is right now on the rise
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.240]   because of the lockdown, so providing a lot of
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:31.680]   club, academic, homeschool-related badges
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.820]   and supporting material, and she's working in that area,
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.180]   and she's, right there, she's learning how to move quickly
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.320]   in an office environment, so typically,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.920]   and I think it is true, a lot of illustrators or artists
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:51.760]   have a hard time with time management in general,
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.460]   and it's kind of the reason why they're here now,
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.260]   and so this has been a good opening for her,
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.540]   she's found someone who can give her the mentorship
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.760]   she needs in an office environment,
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.960]   but that also validates her artistic skills.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.300]   - So, you have four, you have four older children,
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.120]   all four of them are out of the house,
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.120]   and is it accurate that, especially the older two,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.780]   if not the 18-year-olds, but that they are able to
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.300]   use their talents to provide enough income for themselves,
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.700]   or they're able to support themselves,
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.420]   or at least mostly support themselves, is that accurate?
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.340]   - Yeah, no, and support themselves entirely.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.180]   - Right.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.540]   - In fact, I think,
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:38.900]   in some ways, as the years have gone by,
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.060]   I realize that they don't have to be, you know,
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.960]   world-class level, 10,000 hours in order to be able
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.620]   to make a living with their talent set,
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.500]   so if I would tell parents, it's like,
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.060]   if they're on to something, and they're super passionate
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.660]   about it, and motivated, and they have enough of a skill set,
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.100]   so of course, in the popular literature,
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.620]   you'll see a lot of that, especially for adults,
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.620]   you know, saying you can't run on passion,
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.740]   and find a livelihood and a career,
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.180]   and I agree with that, too, in the sense that
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.980]   if you have passion, but no skill set,
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.780]   it's not, you're gonna set yourself up for frustration,
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.540]   so if you can get enough of a skill set together,
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.580]   and a passion and motivation to become really good
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.980]   at something, I think it carries its own momentum,
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.100]   so once you get out there, and you start, you know,
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.960]   delivering on the value, so like my oldest,
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.180]   he started doing some real estate work,
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.660]   he quickly realized who the big paying clients were,
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.180]   and who were not, so then the big paying clients,
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.020]   he noticed they loved it if you handled all the voiceover
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.100]   for them on their advertisement, so he quickly figured out
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.580]   how to find voice actors, charge extra for that,
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.860]   and one thing would lead to another,
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.020]   and so once you got out into the marketplace,
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:02.020]   that kind of helps drive the talent development further.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:07.100]   - Right, when you, one of the things that has inspired me
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.820]   from the past, and maybe I've projected this onto you,
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.980]   but we were talking, or I was watching
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.420]   some of your social media stuff,
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.620]   and I got the impression that you and your wife
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.420]   have worked hard to help your children
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.940]   to integrate their schooling with practical expression,
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.580]   so the examples that I've given,
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.340]   which you can correct the record here in a moment,
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.060]   but the examples that I've given would be
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.820]   that if your children are going to have
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.420]   a writing assignment to help with their writing,
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.060]   that you've encouraged them, well yes, you need to write,
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.860]   but what you need to write is you need to write
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.060]   an email newsletter to your email list,
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.660]   and so your son who did blade making
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.380]   had a blade making list, and your daughter who does art
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.060]   has her art list, and so it's not just
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.940]   an empty, dead writing assignment
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.620]   that the teacher's gonna read, give you a grade,
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.500]   and then go away, rather you're creating
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.540]   a writing assignment for a modern practical purpose
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.900]   that's infinitely useful, and then in the context of that,
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.740]   I think of course you're helping your children
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.060]   to acquire very valuable skills,
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.540]   to be able to run a newsletter,
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.540]   you're acquiring resources and assets
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.780]   and helping them build assets like an email list.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.180]   You mentioned that your son had a portfolio,
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.580]   which obviously can be seen on Instagram
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.880]   and probably other things as well,
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.540]   but he's got a portfolio of work,
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.540]   accumulated over years, and so you've got a resume
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.660]   that's very expansive, and somebody can look
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.220]   at his Instagram profile that he built
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.860]   under his Blades of Black screen name,
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.100]   but they can see that, and not only will they see
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.400]   his growth, they'll be able to look back
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.020]   to his early projects and see he started as an amateur
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.880]   and he had decent results, and then look,
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.620]   here's this fine work that he's producing years later,
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.080]   but they can also see more about him as a person.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.260]   They can see that he's able to punctuate sentences properly,
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.940]   that they can see the breadth of his vocabulary,
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.660]   and I just have such a tremendous admiration for that idea,
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.660]   and I think that that's my ambition
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.100]   as my children start to move out of the basic levels
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.460]   where we are of learning to read, learning to write,
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.700]   learning the basics of math, and we get to the point
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.300]   where they're pursuing those kinds of things.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.800]   I very much want their education to be integrated
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.120]   in skillset like that.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:31.320]   - Yeah, the writing part has been amazing,
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.160]   and when I first started, I mean, I was willful enough
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.180]   that I was going to do it, I was gonna try this.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.600]   I mean, I tried a lot of things on my kids.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.520]   Everything was safe. (laughs)
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.480]   There's no danger there, but all I have to do is,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.560]   and I encourage other people listening to this,
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.500]   I beg them, just flashback on your days in junior high
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.940]   and in high school, and get a reality dose
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.380]   of what it was like back then.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.080]   I mean, you can remember some great things,
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.580]   but there are a lot of things that were, I'm sure,
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.700]   very frustrating, and I remember,
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.500]   I wasn't a bad writer in school.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.460]   I didn't really have difficulty in that area.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.560]   I wouldn't say I shined, but I was probably average,
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.260]   but I remember the frustration.
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.940]   You spend so much time, they'll tell you,
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.640]   okay, go research something, let's say, on George Washington
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.620]   and so you don't have, okay, you know it's history,
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.420]   you're gonna write something, but you know,
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.860]   as you put in that last sentence,
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.040]   that no one's gonna read it.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.820]   Your parents won't even read it.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.460]   Seriously, they will not even read it.
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.660]   When they read it, their eyes are kind of glazed over.
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.460]   Your teachers, she's getting 30 of them at the same time.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.820]   Everybody's written about George Washington's
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.220]   wooden teeth or whatever.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.700]   There's nothing new that can be said,
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.620]   and you don't know enough about the subject,
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.620]   and so you get, I think people, teenagers,
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.220]   start getting that nagging feeling
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.420]   that a lot of what they're doing doesn't matter,
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:55.420]   and it is true that some things you have to do
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.080]   that don't matter, but there's plenty of things
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.800]   that you could do to make it matter.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.220]   - The question is just why bother wasting your time?
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.420]   If there's something that you can do
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.060]   that's gonna accomplish the same thing,
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.020]   and here's why I like so much what you've done
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.300]   with your children on Instagram.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.580]   I admire the idea, we'll see when we get to it,
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.780]   but I admire the idea that students should write
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.260]   just a little bit every day.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.420]   There's certainly a big difference between a 30-page paper
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.700]   and the skill of creating a 30-page paper
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.180]   or a 300-page book versus something short,
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:41.760]   but in order to develop the skill, the muscle of writing,
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.300]   writing a little bit every day is ideal,
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.260]   and the thing I noticed,
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.660]   and I don't know if this is at your direction,
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.300]   but as I watch your children's social media posts,
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.220]   I notice that they write a couple of paragraphs.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.820]   They'll take an Instagram post
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.620]   and they'll write a couple of paragraphs,
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.540]   and as I see it, that's ideal,
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.660]   and it makes it a more practical way.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.220]   I admired some of the results
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.700]   that Art Robinson got with his children.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.820]   I don't know if you're familiar with him,
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.180]   but his basic requirement for his children
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.420]   was that they did an hour or two of math a day,
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.900]   that they wrote a page-long essay per day,
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.980]   and that they read off of a required reading list
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.300]   that he curated that would be a comprehensive reading list,
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.900]   and that was the basic outline of their educational format,
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.260]   and as I've thought about that writing requirement,
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.060]   I've thought, "I really wanna do that with my children,"
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.620]   but I can just see them every day sitting down
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.580]   and making up some goofy essay that's not actually useful
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.820]   'cause you know it's not gonna be used,
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.520]   but when I observe your children's Instagram posts
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.420]   and I see how they're writing about what they're learning,
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.820]   it's a useful piece of writing that actually has value,
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.180]   and because it's being seen,
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.020]   it's enhancing the desire and enhancing the impact
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.540]   as to why they should actually do it,
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.220]   so I think this is a wonderful technique
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.740]   that we can integrate to really help our children
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.500]   not only do their best work,
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.380]   but even get feedback on their work
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.220]   through some of the social channels.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:15.900]   - You know, I take our daughter to a local ballet school
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:20.380]   that has a very good reputation, very thoughtful school,
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.960]   and she enjoys it, and this is more of a hobby right now,
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.060]   but when I see there are some students in there
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.980]   that are very dedicated, obviously,
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.620]   and the parents are dedicated, they love it,
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.820]   they just, they have the energy, the motivation,
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.480]   and the passion to do it,
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.540]   and when situations like this,
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.920]   my thinking and my philosophy head comes on
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.160]   and I'm like, you know what?
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.460]   I would love to go into these kids' curriculums
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.940]   and say, okay, they're writing about George Washington,
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.780]   you know, they're going,
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.300]   maybe they're even in a public school
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.700]   where you may don't have as much leeway to do what you want,
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.540]   but you could there, too,
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:02.020]   so let's say your child is passionate about ballet,
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.660]   they're doing George Washington, she's 12,
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.900]   and typically they might, I don't know what they do now,
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.420]   but back then they would give you
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.140]   two or three ideas to write about,
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.700]   or maybe you could go to the library, look up something,
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.260]   and it's something that's been rehashed before
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.460]   and you don't have much to say about it as a child.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.860]   At least nothing you know that your parents
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.660]   and your teacher would want to repeat and share,
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.500]   and you can't use it again as a portfolio
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.840]   because it's so meaningless to you personally.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.280]   You're not gonna post it up anywhere,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.340]   you're not gonna share it to your friends.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.900]   You get the grade and you're done and move on.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.420]   However, if you had a different mindset,
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.280]   you could say, hey, it's George Washington's time,
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.200]   I wonder what they did in the dance world during that time.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.140]   So just a barely a little effort,
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.860]   you'll probably quickly discover
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.180]   that there are particular dances
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.580]   that the upper classes did and participated in.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.940]   Wouldn't it be amazing,
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.820]   so instead of writing about George Washington's teeth
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.140]   or him crossing the Delaware,
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.220]   you write something about how dance was used
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.700]   during George Washington's time.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.900]   And I think there's a lot of information about that.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.140]   So you would obviously write something
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.760]   that you're already passionate about,
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.060]   you'd understand the terms that are being used,
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.100]   you'd understand new terms,
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.520]   and you'd be able to put it in a true historical contest
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.280]   'cause that's the thing that you find out
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.500]   with talent and other things
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.600]   is that things that you study have meaning.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.180]   Dance, even at the time George Washington
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.820]   was a way for people to socially connect with each other.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.760]   And they had particular techniques
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.380]   and things of doing things from a dancer's perspective
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.140]   could be absolutely fascinating.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.340]   But it would also, and here's the interesting thing,
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.820]   it would also fascinate your teacher.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.180]   For the first time, they're reading something interesting
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.180]   that they never read about before.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:54.340]   In a language where a 12-year-old is all excited about this,
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.900]   this is what it means, this is what they did,
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.460]   this is how it's different than it is now,
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.620]   this is amazing.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.060]   You had all this ritual and courtship going on
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.820]   and you could talk about this.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.140]   And I tell you, at that point in time,
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.260]   that essay, that little essay by a 12-year-old
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.240]   about George Washington is going to be read.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.580]   It's going to be read by grandma,
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.060]   it's gonna be read by the dad who's like,
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.520]   "Oh, wow, this is different.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.740]   "My girl's pretty interesting."
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.920]   The teacher's gonna put this aside and say to her husband,
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.820]   "Finally, something new."
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.880]   And you can take that essay,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.260]   same amount of time as you would researching something
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.540]   that they've already written about a million times,
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.020]   you'd gladly put that up on a little blog post.
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.300]   You'd take that to your teacher, your ballet teacher,
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.140]   and they would show that.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.400]   So you get this amazing feedback loop
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.540]   that gets started in kids.
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.340]   It's like, "Wow, I have something to say
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.200]   "about this time period
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.640]   "through the lens of my passion and interest."
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.420]   And so that's really what I've been trying to do
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.260]   with my kids.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.500]   Like some things you may have to do,
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.820]   there are things you have to do
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.700]   that are sometimes difficult to hijack
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.540]   and take over for your own direct purposes,
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.460]   but you'd be amazed how much you can do.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.860]   Just in that example, you got dance.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:13.860]   How does that fit with George Washington?
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.060]   And it's amazing the connections you can make.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.880]   And so from then on, if the child wanted to keep going down,
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.400]   she could go in any number of directions,
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.980]   but she has a deep understanding of history
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.580]   from the perspective of her talent.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.400]   And when she bumps into people
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.340]   who are much more advanced than her,
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.340]   she's gonna find that the doors are gonna open up.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.780]   - I think that this will help
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.380]   to remember more about history
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.960]   because my opinion is that I only remember
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.220]   the things that I've ever been interested in.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.780]   I feel like so much of school was a waste for me
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.140]   because I absorbed information,
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.260]   but it was information
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.620]   that I wasn't particularly interested in,
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.800]   and thus I didn't retain it.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.260]   And I've not been willing to embrace
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.100]   the mantra of the unschooler
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.700]   of only study things you're interested in,
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.180]   but I like these ideas as a way of saying,
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.680]   how can we make this interesting to you
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.520]   because of your uniqueness
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.340]   so that you're more likely to retain
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.380]   the things that you're studying
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.580]   and the things that you're learning about?
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.140]   I love the idea.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.540]   If you were to talk about
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:30.500]   the focusing on passion or on talent,
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.300]   if you're focusing on that,
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.560]   do you feel like you had to give up something?
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.740]   Well, first, did you feel you had to give up something
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.640]   in order to focus on talent?
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.660]   If so, what was it for your children?
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.340]   And if so, is there anything that you regret?
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.660]   Is there anything that you feel like your children
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.060]   don't have that at this point you're doing differently
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.700]   with your younger children than your older children
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.900]   because you were so focused on their talent?
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.500]   - The short answer is no.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.460]   I really do not.
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.580]   In fact, that kind of surprised me
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:10.160]   that I tried a lot of things,
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.780]   and some things just weren't worth it.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.700]   I can't even remember them.
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.100]   I wrote them down somewhere.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.180]   But I still had a pretty good instinct,
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.440]   and honestly, you read a lot
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.020]   of what other people have tried,
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.560]   so you know what can and can't be done.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.660]   You know what the limits of human experiments can be.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.220]   And you also remember your own youth,
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.820]   so there's some things.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.820]   I will have to say, and there is one negative
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.100]   that popped up more later that I'll address,
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:45.100]   but the one feedback I got constantly from other people,
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.280]   and that even shocked me,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.440]   as to how amazing it was to me as an adult,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.580]   as I'm doing it with my children,
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.980]   is how much passion, how much motivation.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.360]   I cannot tell you how many times.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.480]   Our biggest issue is you gotta turn off the lights
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.020]   and get to bed, 'cause they'll be so absorbed
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.140]   in pursuing whatever aspect of this skill set
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.260]   that they're trying to develop.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.020]   They're so engrossed in it, they can't stop.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.500]   And we all know that feeling, right?
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.100]   You're into something so much that you can't stop.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.920]   And as a dad, I have to get in there and say,
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.240]   you know, they have limitations on their sleep schedules,
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.360]   'cause they'll pay for it tomorrow,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.520]   or mom and dad will pay for it.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.920]   So it's like, okay, it's nine o'clock, it's time to stop.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.440]   It's time to stop programming.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.080]   It's time to stop working on that blade.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.800]   Please, it's midnight, I can go one more.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.640]   It's like, okay, you know, let's cool it here.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.200]   And so that is something that other parents want really bad.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.720]   I want that too in my kids, and I will say that I think
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.980]   when you talk to the average parent,
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.740]   and that would have included myself,
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:52.980]   say, what do you want for your kids?
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.260]   Say, I want them to be motivated,
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.660]   and I want them to be happy.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:02.260]   And everybody wants that for their child.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.420]   But the key to that being happy and motivated
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.540]   is not be motivated, just saying the words,
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.180]   be motivated, be happy, is they don't have a direction.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.860]   And your happiness and your motivation comes
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.740]   basically in falling in love around
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.480]   creating and doing something
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.160]   that has meaning and purpose to it.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.600]   So in that, we were talking a little bit about
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.560]   some of the potential dangers of a more whole unschooling.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.580]   And of course, it depends what you mean by the definition.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.780]   But if by unschooling, you mean you're just going
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.760]   from thing to thing, one shiny new thing to another,
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.720]   you can't develop enough of a depth
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.760]   to start creating and doing something interesting.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.920]   So this is the example of someone who practices
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.520]   five days on the piano, gives up and say,
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.120]   hey, I'm not really good at this.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.160]   Now I'm gonna become a soccer superstar.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.340]   They go for two weeks at soccer,
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.680]   they realize they're not at the top,
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.020]   so they abandon it and they say,
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.120]   I'm gonna go into scuba diving next.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.640]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.460]   I'm talking about latching onto something,
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.640]   even if it's a small thing,
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.880]   and gradually cultivating it into something amazing.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.760]   And that's where, and the same,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.680]   teenagers are just like adults.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.380]   If you're doing work, you want to know
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.340]   that your work has some kind of meaning to the outside world
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:21.000]   apart from yourself, and you want to feel productive.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.120]   You want to feel competent.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.400]   And those are important feelings to have.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.120]   I don't think they're wrong feelings,
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.780]   and you just need to understand
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.400]   that that's what a young person needs.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.340]   They are at that point, they're transitioning from childhood.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.380]   It's not enough to give them hugs and say,
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.640]   you are loved, you're great.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.500]   Meanwhile, they're on the couch just playing video games,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.500]   feeling bad about themselves,
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.260]   'cause they have nothing to give to the world,
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.560]   and they know it, and they honestly don't.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.560]   So they need to find something that they can cultivate.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.740]   That's the secret.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.520]   - That's a really powerful,
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.980]   that's a really powerful concept, Jonathan.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.540]   If you think about so many of the things
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.820]   that are affecting young people today,
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.440]   I see what you just said as having very broad application.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.040]   I've never thought about it exactly the way
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.280]   that you just articulated it,
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.400]   but to me, that rings so dramatically true.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:23.560]   What we've done, so I think most of us would acknowledge
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.640]   that we seem to have a significant cultural problem,
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:31.080]   at least or especially in US American culture
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.320]   with our young people.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.020]   Our young people are not thriving, broadly speaking.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.400]   They are not thriving as they once did.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.840]   They're not thriving, broadly speaking.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.060]   And so if you trace this back in history,
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.320]   I don't know, of course, psychological surveys and whatnot,
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.280]   we don't have all of them throughout history,
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.240]   but if you trace these back in history,
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.600]   I don't think it was always this bad.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.000]   I think that children at one point in time
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.920]   had a much stronger sense of anchor,
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.920]   being of an anchoring place in life than they do now.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.640]   And so as I see it from my perspective,
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.560]   there are a number of things.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.440]   Number one is children need to feel like they belong,
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.680]   like they're in a family,
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.840]   and that family is a coherent, cohesive unit
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.480]   that's likely to last, now they feel that they belong.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.560]   And so ideally, we gain our primary sense
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.560]   of belonging and identity from our family.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.080]   Ideally, our family should expand outwards to our clan,
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.920]   that we're part of a larger clan,
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.240]   and we know this is what it means to be a Harris,
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.960]   or this is what it means to be a Sheets,
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.520]   or this is what it means to be a McGillicuddy,
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.320]   that this is our clan, this is who we stand for.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.040]   Then that expands out into the community
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:51.000]   in terms of a very clear religious identity,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.560]   a very clear geographic identity, right?
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:58.000]   We're New Englanders, or this is who we are,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.680]   and we know that.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.720]   And then it expands outwards.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.660]   We're Americans, right?
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:02.560]   This is who we are.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.840]   We're Bolivians, whatever the identity is.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.280]   And so there is a major component to that identity,
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.880]   and that identity itself has been very heavily fractured,
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.240]   that if you ask a lot of people,
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.560]   "What does it mean to be an American?"
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.120]   We're not really sure about that,
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.580]   and you see the problems of our lack of sureness.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.240]   If you ask, "What does it mean to be a Harris?"
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.880]   What does it mean to be a Sheets?
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.180]   Well, some of us are hardcore about this,
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.600]   but most families don't have a family mission statement.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.520]   Most families don't have a list of characteristics
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.680]   that they put on the wall that says,
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.640]   "This is who we are, and this is what we stand for.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.400]   "This is what we're gonna be known for."
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:43.120]   And so a child is very unanchored, untethered.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.880]   And so then, what other form of identity do you find?
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.520]   Well, throughout history,
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.760]   people have found meaning and identity in their work.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.440]   Most of our names come from what we did.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.040]   If your last name is Baker,
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.140]   it's usually because your family were the Bakers,
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.080]   or there's so many words that are traditional surnames
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.720]   that come from what you do.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.780]   Well, throughout history, teenagers and adolescents
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.800]   have always been anchored to, "This is what we do."
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.080]   And so there was the family farm,
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.140]   and there was work for children to do,
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.520]   or there was the family business.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.980]   I labor in the carpenter shop with my father.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.760]   But in our modern world, our work lives have so fractured
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.680]   that usually our family is not involved
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.080]   in our modern work lives,
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.800]   just because it's very, very difficult, right?
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.300]   Your four-year-old wants to come in and see you,
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.600]   and it's a little hard for you to have her
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.360]   on the interview, right?
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.880]   If mine come in and see me,
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.040]   it's a little hard to bring them up
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.680]   and involve them into exactly what we're doing here.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.120]   And so we put children into this school environment,
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.040]   but they're smart enough to know
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.680]   that the majority of their work doesn't really have meaning.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.640]   They're smart enough to know,
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.280]   "You're telling me I'm gonna use algebra,
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.200]   "but then I take my algebra homework home,
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.300]   "and I ask my dad for help,
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.640]   "and he says, 'I don't know how to do that stuff,
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.480]   "'and you're telling me it's supposed to matter.'"
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.160]   And so it's not anchored to it,
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.720]   and the work doesn't matter.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.320]   And so if you can connect teenagers
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.040]   back to the sense of, "My work matters.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.340]   "People notice my work,
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.460]   "and I have something productive to do,"
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.960]   it helps to start to facilitate a sense of identity.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.640]   And that sense of identity is actually authentic,
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:22.280]   because it's related to who you are and what you do.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.320]   And so many people try to separate identity
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.360]   from what they do, and they say,
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.120]   "Well, this is who I am,"
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.360]   without having proof of it, without doing it.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.920]   I think it just tricks the subconscious.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.100]   So I think that what you've said is really powerful,
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.700]   and a component of the piece to help a young adolescent
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.100]   to feel anchored to a sense of identity
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.960]   that can help to quell some of that teenage angst.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.400]   I think it's really profound.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.680]   - Oh, I think it is.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.480]   And I mean, and as adults, we feel the same way.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.520]   I mean, can you imagine in the workforce,
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.360]   your boss comes to you, you say,
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.840]   "Hey, I'd like to take you these series of certificates."
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.040]   You're an Excel specialist at the corporation,
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.880]   you're doing whatever it is, accounting,
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.400]   and they say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.680]   "I know you're not an IT guy,
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.820]   "you hate computers and everything,
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.140]   "but tell me, could you take this certification on routers?
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.660]   "And when you're done with the certification,
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.140]   "we promise that you'll never use it again."
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:20.460]   How would an adult, they would have a mental breakdown,
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.300]   right?
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.780]   And by the way, if you don't pass this course,
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.060]   then 100% will fire you, but no worry,
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.440]   once you pass it, you'll never use it again.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.480]   That is Kafkaesque.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.000]   That is crazy.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   And I cannot, I mean, I have met more than one person
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.820]   as an adult who's still reeling from the fact,
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.140]   I'll just use a fictional example here,
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.520]   just in case old friends are listening.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.520]   But imagine you had a passion for Russian language,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.420]   and you threw yourself into it.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.420]   You studied everything, you knew every bad guy
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.620]   in Russian history, you could speak it,
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.740]   you could speak it fluently, you wrote your essays,
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.380]   you knew all the dates, you knew the ins and the outs,
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.580]   you knew it all.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.780]   And then at 18, they tell you,
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.700]   "By the way, for the rest of your life,
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.700]   "you're not allowed to speak it, use it,
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.860]   "discuss it with anybody."
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.100]   What kind of mind meltdown would you have?
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:17.100]   Because you have genuine knowledge that cannot be used.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.580]   And I see this people doing with music, for example.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.220]   This is a really, not everyone, but a lot.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:27.460]   I've met people, passion for some kind of musical instrument.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.260]   Parents pay tons of money to go to a particular school,
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.740]   even after high school, they got top training.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:37.100]   The day they finished, they stopped using it.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.540]   They just drop off, they just cease using it entirely.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.660]   And 20 years later, 15 years later,
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.420]   I'll bump into a person like that,
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.180]   and it's like, "Do you ever use it for birthday parties?"
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.460]   "Oh, no, no, no."
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.340]   "Do you ever use it in your church environment?"
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.500]   "No, no, no, the music is too low,
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.020]   "my stuff is too advanced, I can't use it."
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.220]   "Do you ever use it for friends?"
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.740]   "Do you ever use it at a coffee club?"
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.180]   "No, they never use it again."
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.660]   And it creates a kind of mental anguish in people
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:08.180]   because they can't make sense of why they spent six,
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.580]   eight years, maybe more, pursuing something
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:15.260]   that had no way to bring value to other people.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.980]   So I'm not saying music is not important.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.580]   I'm not saying Russian literature is not important.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.700]   What I am saying is people will pursue,
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.340]   and these are kind of extreme examples,
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.580]   which I don't think is too far off the truth
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:31.020]   for some people, they'll pursue this type of knowledge
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.460]   and they haven't thought about the consequences
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.060]   of what happens when they can't use it.
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:41.020]   Right, and you're creating some kind of crazy mental anguish.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.360]   You can't share your love,
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.120]   you can't share your understanding.
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.420]   You can't even make a living with it.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.260]   And this is what people do.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.380]   They'll pursue, take years pursuing.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.540]   Now this is one extreme, right,
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.100]   where people are pursuing an actual skill set
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.980]   where it takes a lot of work.
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.300]   Not everybody's in that category,
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.220]   but there is a group of people who are super motivated.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.380]   They dot all their I's, cross all their T's,
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.460]   and then they finish, they come with a finished product
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.620]   that makes no sense to their life.
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.820]   To me, that's a horror situation.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.300]   If I were to write a horror movie,
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.620]   the Twilight Zone, that's what it would be.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.180]   Show a guy, but he can never talk about it again.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:20.420]   That's the kind of mental hell.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.140]   And then of course you have a lot of other people
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.900]   who are not in that particular category.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.420]   You have other people who are constantly
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.420]   changing their minds, one shiny thing after another.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.620]   They can't make up, and that's another issue
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:34.460]   that I feel like the philosophy I've developed
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.820]   addresses too at the same time.
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.140]   So you want to develop something
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:41.780]   that is a genuine skill set, you're skillful at it.
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.580]   In other words, you can bring value.
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.180]   And then the second component of that is
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.220]   you need to bring value to people
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.060]   to find out how you're gonna change the world.
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.820]   You don't necessarily know that
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.420]   unless you start trying to apply it.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.820]   - Earlier you said that there was one issue.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.220]   What was that one issue that you did?
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.340]   - Well, I found, yeah.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:07.940]   Homeschoolers in particular are well aware
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.900]   that if you don't fit in the norm,
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:11.460]   many times you have to constantly explain
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.860]   what your kids are doing or not doing.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.220]   And I think we kind of got that,
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.860]   most homeschoolers have that down now.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.460]   Plus there's enough homeschoolers out there
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:24.180]   that the social difficulty really isn't there as it was,
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.020]   let's say, even 15 years ago.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.500]   But as they got into closer to college age,
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:35.500]   I did notice that even though my kids were really skillful
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.040]   and able to make a living on their own and so forth,
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.260]   they're in that in-between zone
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.620]   where a lot of their peers are actually
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.180]   just starting to go to college.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.060]   A lot of them are just frankly goofing off,
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.260]   floating around, living the good life,
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.060]   always available to go to the beach.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:54.900]   Maybe I had not prepared my,
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.140]   I did tell them verbally,
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.220]   but that apparently wasn't enough.
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.620]   People are not gonna be able to compute
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.580]   that you're already successful at what you do,
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.900]   but you're only 20, 21, and you're not in college.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.580]   So their mindset is if you're not in college,
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.420]   you're a loser, you're not really doing anything
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.820]   with your life.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.540]   If you're doing something with your life,
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.140]   then you must be in college.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:17.180]   And so that was a difficult one, I think,
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.100]   for my boys especially to navigate socially,
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.700]   especially right smack dab
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.580]   when everybody's starting to go to college.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.980]   It's starting to get a little easier for them now.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.540]   And this is just anecdotally as it related to me.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.060]   I don't know if they would put it in so many words,
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.100]   but that is what I noticed.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.220]   As they're, now that their friends are now starting
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.740]   to come out of college, it's not so difficult.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:45.420]   - Yeah, I could see that being a major challenge.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.940]   I always, I reflect back on why did I go to college?
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.940]   And the reason I went to college basically was
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.580]   that only losers didn't go to college,
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:57.180]   and I'm not a loser, so I'm gonna go to college.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:01.700]   In hindsight, I do think about what I could have done
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.500]   if someone had coached me in some of the interesting ways
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.940]   that some of the radical ideas,
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.760]   but I didn't have anyone who was kind of plugged in enough
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.340]   to coach me in that way.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:14.660]   But even so, there is still some social credibility.
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:18.800]   There is still something that goes along with college.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.020]   And especially in that phase of your life, right?
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:26.020]   If you're in college and you spend 2/3 of your year
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:29.020]   goofing off, but you say, "I'm in college,
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.540]   "everybody understands."
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.660]   But if you're not in college
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.580]   and you spend 2/3 of your year goofing off,
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.660]   nobody understands.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.460]   Why are you being so irresponsible?
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.860]   And so if you have that veneer that you can put over things,
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:40.700]   oh, I'm in college,
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.140]   then everything becomes simpler, socially speaking.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.820]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:50.500]   And that's really hard to fight.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:55.500]   And I guess it's the cost of being a pioneer in some areas.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.740]   If you wanna be on the cutting edge,
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.740]   then there are some social costs.
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.340]   They're not insurmountable.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:06.340]   It's just, I think by the time the second born came along,
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:12.700]   I was a little more aware of it,
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.380]   that it was a bigger problem than I thought it was going to be
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:18.000]   as far as to how to navigate socially.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.940]   And I actually drilled him.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:21.780]   I said, "What do you do?
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:22.600]   "What are you doing?"
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.660]   Pretending that was somebody, just met him.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.580]   "What are you doing?"
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:25.620]   And he would say something like,
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.060]   "Well, I kinda dabble in this."
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.840]   I'm like, "No, that's not right.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.820]   "You don't dabble in it.
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.660]   "You're like at this level.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.060]   "And you need to say, not arrogantly,
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:34.320]   "but have a certain sense of purpose.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.140]   "You're not sleeping in your car under the bridge.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.300]   "You're doing something with your life."
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.260]   And he'd be intimidated 'cause everybody else would say,
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.500]   "You know, I'm in third year of college.
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.460]   "I'm in second year of college."
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.420]   And he didn't have that.
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.060]   He couldn't say it in that way.
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.940]   And so he had to kind of, now he's not, he's okay.
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.260]   But it did throw them off.
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.100]   - Right, right.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.500]   In hindsight, one question I wanna ask you.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:05.100]   I've had this idea where I think that,
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.220]   basically, my idea, my ambition,
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:12.140]   subject to needing to watch my individual children, right?
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.400]   'Cause I don't wanna just impose my frame onto them.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.900]   I wanna think and observe them.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.920]   But if my children are academically competent,
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.180]   my basic framework is I think that
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:30.420]   an academically bright child can basically substitute
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:34.420]   a college degree for high school work.
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.380]   And so let's say, for example,
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.380]   you're taking an algebra class, right,
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.760]   as you're going to for math.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.480]   Well, I think that with just a little bit of coaching,
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.180]   that same student can go ahead and take the CLEP exam
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.780]   or the DSST exam for algebra one
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.300]   and thus start to rack up college credit.
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.860]   If you're gonna take a chemistry class,
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.980]   well, go ahead and just pass the chemistry CLEP exam.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.400]   If you're gonna study history,
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.540]   then prepare for the AP history exam.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.780]   And so I think a student can very easily,
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.700]   with some coaching, accumulate 60 or 90 hours
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:10.020]   of college credit just simply through CLEP exams
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.980]   and their associated,
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:16.340]   and the other competitors to the CLEP exams.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.780]   And it can map perfectly to a high school curriculum,
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.860]   a normal standard high school curriculum,
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.160]   but it results in college credit
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.760]   by quizzes at the end of the courses.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.280]   And then for, let's say, 30 or 40 credit hours
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.900]   of capstone courses towards 120 credit hour degree,
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.220]   I would encourage my children,
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.540]   I plan to encourage my children to go ahead
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.100]   and do some classes, might be some local classes
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.260]   at a local college, might be online classes,
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.100]   and go ahead and take those capstone courses
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.380]   so that they go ahead and finish a college degree
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.180]   by the age of 18 or so, maybe 19, maybe 20,
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.220]   but 18, something like that.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.220]   So I don't think that that college degree
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:57.220]   is as valuable as a very highly ranked college degree
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.700]   might be, it's not gonna open all the same doors,
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.860]   but I look at it as, it's good insurance, right?
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.020]   It'll allow that child to always be able to say,
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.660]   hey, I have a college degree,
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.540]   and if they want to pursue something at a specialty level,
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.820]   they wanna become an advanced engineer,
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.820]   well, then you just pursue that either with the degree
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.740]   at a certain university or pursue it at a master's degree
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.700]   and go ahead and get those really high quality credentials
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.260]   that you may need for some subjects.
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:28.860]   My concern is that academics come easily to me,
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.540]   and my concern is I don't see a lot of the parallels
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.260]   between the necessity of academics to modern life,
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.780]   which is what you're talking about.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.140]   You encourage your children, develop your skills,
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.100]   develop your passion, and I see that it's possible
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:48.100]   for that academic orientation to hinder a child
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.820]   from developing their skills.
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.420]   You know, if somebody is very good at making blades
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.420]   or making art or making computer code,
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.460]   are they really served by being able to check the box
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.620]   over here for a college degree,
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:03.460]   especially if having to take all those classes
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.860]   and do all that studies resulted in them
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.380]   spending 2,000 fewer hours on their skill?
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:10.460]   I'm not sure.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.260]   So from your perspective, knowing what you know now,
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.740]   I gather that you didn't encourage your children
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.620]   to pursue a college degree, you prepared them,
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.860]   and they're all doing well.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.860]   What do you think about, what do you think about
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.220]   for me as a young parent with that kind of idea?
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:28.300]   - Well, no, I don't think what we're talking about
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.500]   is not mutually exclusive.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:33.100]   What I would say is if you, so in other words,
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.980]   and I've told my kids, I'm not opposed to my kids
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.220]   pursuing a college degree.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.380]   What I am saying is if you're gonna pursue a college degree,
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.460]   then you gotta have a plan for it.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:46.460]   So I happened to bump into a fellow here in Oklahoma
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.660]   in a community several years ago,
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.780]   and it just, it was a, we have a little lake here,
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:52.980]   and so when people are around the lake,
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:53.820]   they kind of relax.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.780]   And anyways, this fellow turned out to be
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:00.180]   a surgeon or a doctor of some kind,
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:03.100]   and we just were striking up a conversation,
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:06.220]   and we had kids, and so subject of kids came up,
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.260]   and he happened to mention that he came up
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:12.240]   from a line of doctors, and he had,
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.020]   I think grandchildren, I think maybe it was
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.860]   grandchildren that were also either in college now
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.580]   pursuing a medical degree, and some high school students
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.660]   coming up, and he was extremely proud of this lineage.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.780]   So as I am, I like to quiz people
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.620]   to find out what they're doing.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.420]   And he, if I were, if I, I don't know this person,
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.660]   never met him, but I would love to have interviewed him,
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.960]   he would have done exactly what kind of you're talking about,
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.300]   kind of my philosophy, but combined with academics,
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:45.300]   since they knew that the medical life was a passion
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.740]   for their whole family, they loved it.
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:47.780]   From the way he talked about it,
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.380]   it was something his kids were good at,
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:52.700]   they were fascinated, they took academic camps,
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.460]   they did all sorts of crazy medical stuff,
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.820]   but they understood that that was their passion.
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:01.100]   And so once you understand that, let's say,
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.540]   you know what, we're really good at numbers and math,
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:06.220]   we've got an uncle, we've got a Nobel Prize person,
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:10.180]   we got it all, and everybody just gets excited about it,
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.340]   then I would say, well then, you do the exact same thing.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.660]   Every time, let's say you do George Washington,
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.100]   talk about the math developments
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.540]   during George Washington's time,
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.400]   because what that's going to do
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.260]   is create an amazing portfolio for you
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.460]   to really get into the top, let's say,
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:27.220]   learning institutions for a math degree or a medical degree,
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.300]   or you could do, like, if it was a medical thing,
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.320]   I would say, well then, find out what the medical practices
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.820]   were during George Washington's time, right?
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.260]   That's the kind of stuff that will look really good
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.700]   in a portfolio when you're trying to get
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.740]   into a top-tier school.
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:41.100]   They're not gonna want it, they're gonna say,
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.300]   wow, this guy is committed,
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.300]   he understands the philosophy behind medicine,
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.780]   he understands the history,
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.240]   in addition to being able to take the math classes.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.900]   So I would say it's that in-between,
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:55.180]   that mediocre average is like the killer zone.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.480]   So if you're saying, well, I don't know,
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.340]   maybe college will or will not do anything for me,
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.540]   so then you run the danger,
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.860]   well, you could have developed something else
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.660]   that could have taken you somewhere.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:07.740]   But if you say, okay, academics is my thing,
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:10.660]   this particular specialty, which requires
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.700]   a certain level of math or a certain level
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:17.700]   of scientific knowledge, then embrace it fully.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.140]   Start seeing things through those lens.
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.660]   So because it's a long ways away,
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:26.460]   I've met medical guys who, and I've,
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.940]   anyways, I have a friend who told me that,
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.820]   who had an older brother who went down this line,
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.900]   and sometimes it become almost suicidal
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.060]   because the amount of study needed
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.460]   and personal isolation for years on end
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:42.460]   was such a big disconnect between the final rewards
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.820]   and in the in-between stage,
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.080]   and not everybody suited for that.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.700]   So that'd be an example of somebody pursuing
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:52.540]   an academic field that was really not suited
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.500]   for their personality or for other reasons.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.980]   But if it is, if this is something you want to embrace,
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.760]   then embrace it fully.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.400]   And so I would say that's the same thing.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.860]   You start, if you're a person, say, you know what,
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.220]   I'm really interested in the medical field.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.060]   I'm not sure exactly how or what,
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.240]   but I know it's gonna involve,
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.860]   I'm gonna need to have a certain level of math,
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.500]   I'm gonna need to have a certain level of biology,
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.860]   physics, and so forth.
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.660]   Then I say embrace it, start a blog.
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:21.780]   You know, start writing about it.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.020]   Every history class you get,
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.460]   find a way to talk your teacher into letting you write
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:30.060]   about something about medical history back in those days.
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.820]   Start taking your camera.
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.140]   I don't know if you're allowed to dissect
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:38.020]   and put that on Instagram, but throw yourself into it.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:41.780]   So you're basically saying you own it.
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.860]   And you start doing the same thing.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.620]   You start writing about it.
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:46.540]   That'd be a good way, right?
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.380]   Start writing.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.540]   Wouldn't you love it if you were a medical person?
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:54.020]   Say, hey, I'm going to write about, you know,
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.860]   George Washington and the teeth.
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.460]   I could take the George Washington teeth.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.020]   I have no idea what they did.
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.500]   And you could talk about abscess,
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.860]   the pain people had back then,
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.140]   the type of drugs that people did or did not take
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:07.420]   in order to get over it, how many people died.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:10.820]   And I'll tell you what, your teacher is gonna be floored.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.940]   They're gonna love reading this.
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:15.140]   And it's gonna look great on your resume,
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:15.980]   and you're gonna be able to share it
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.180]   with all your relatives.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:21.060]   - I'd like to ask you about some of your experience
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:25.900]   with your children and encouraging social media use
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:29.060]   and some of the modern tools that you've embraced
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:29.900]   as a family.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:36.620]   I see the tremendous power and benefits
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:38.620]   of many of the modern tools that we have.
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:42.740]   You and your wife run a successful product company
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:44.580]   using modern digital tools.
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:49.740]   Your children have used tools like Instagram
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.740]   very effectively.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.780]   You use Instagram very effectively, right?
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.380]   Here we are talking, I watch you, I follow your stuff.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:57.540]   Dude, your Instagram profile,
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.900]   and you just do such a great job with it.
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:03.020]   And so I see without question the value
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.660]   of the modern tools.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:09.100]   Simultaneously, I see the danger of them,
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.780]   very, very significant dangers,
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.580]   everything from dangers to a child's mental development,
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:18.100]   stunted mental development,
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.580]   because of the incessant distraction
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.420]   and perhaps even physical damaging effects
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:26.460]   of excessive exposure to digital devices.
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:30.340]   I see the turmoil that happens
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.100]   when people, due to social media addictions,
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.580]   the turmoil that the average teen lives through
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.980]   where what was formerly a very difficult
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:42.140]   but navigable life of the social environment,
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.940]   of in-person social pressure,
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.700]   now has become this extraordinarily difficult
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:49.380]   and I think increasingly unnavigable life
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.900]   of trying to sort this all out
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:53.100]   through the other side of a screen.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.420]   Even just thinking about the challenges for parents.
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.140]   My heart has been broken the last few weeks
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:01.460]   for George and Kellyanne Conway
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:05.940]   with having this intense public spat
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.620]   where you've got George Conway with the political sphere,
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.460]   he's very much anti-President Trump,
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.620]   and you've got Kellyanne Conway
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:12.940]   who's President Trump's staff,
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:15.020]   and you've got their daughter now posting online
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.740]   and she posts something online
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.660]   and of course 50,000 people chime in
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.580]   and say this, this, this,
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:21.940]   and I've just thought what incredible pain
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.540]   that family must be experiencing right now.
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:25.740]   And I don't want that.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:26.860]   I don't want that for my children.
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:27.740]   I don't want that for me.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:28.700]   I don't want that for my wife.
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.540]   And so I'm really, really nervous
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.620]   and trying to discern what's the proper way
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:35.620]   to bring these things in
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:38.460]   because my wife and I, we see the value.
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:39.900]   There's no question.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.340]   But we're concerned about making sure
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:44.300]   we do it at the right way and in the right time, et cetera.
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:48.540]   And so thus, so far we've taken the tack of no devices.
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:50.860]   We don't use any screens, no devices of any kind,
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:55.700]   and I'm really happy with the results that I see from that.
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:00.540]   My son is, my eldest is almost seven.
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:03.460]   He reads fluently in two languages now.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:05.740]   He has a very long attention span.
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.220]   He's got this tremendous diversity of interest.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:11.820]   And so I know that sometime, probably fairly soon,
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:14.300]   I need to start to introduce screens
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.180]   and possibly some of these things,
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.540]   but I'm really nervous about it
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:18.980]   'cause I don't wanna give up some of it.
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:23.140]   So as an experienced father who's navigating this,
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.660]   what advice would you give to me
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.380]   and how would you coach me along this pathway?
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:31.580]   - Well, age obviously has a lot to do with that.
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.660]   So you have a seven-year-old and our seven-year-olds,
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:36.540]   I mean, they have access to screen time,
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:39.780]   but at that age, anything they sign in,
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:41.100]   it's usually actually under my name.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.780]   In fact, I was laughing the other day.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:46.060]   I think some of the social media sites
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.380]   are coming up with solutions for that,
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:50.860]   but my daughter really likes, she's nine,
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:54.900]   she likes following one of the wildlife guys
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.740]   who goes on site and they find chameleons
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:58.820]   and all sorts of things.
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:01.220]   And it's a great wildlife show.
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:05.180]   But she's, and it's on YouTube,
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.820]   and I think there's like a paid version.
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:08.220]   She wanted to use her pocket money,
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.020]   and I looked over and it's like, okay, this is good.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:11.300]   And she blogs about it actually,
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.220]   'cause she's very interested in that science part of it.
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.300]   So I said, if we're gonna watch it,
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.140]   you're gonna blog about it, you're gonna have to summarize it.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:23.140]   And, but in that case, she signed in under my name.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:26.060]   I mean, the media, so I know what's being watched
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:26.940]   and not watched.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.780]   So most of the kids are, if they're involved in that,
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:30.620]   they're under my name.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.980]   Of course, the site, they get comments every once in a while
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.900]   by kids saying, this is amazing.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:36.640]   And of course, my name's on there.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.180]   But I think they figured out,
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:41.500]   these are mostly kids watching, it's kind of kid-oriented.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.820]   And I think they're introducing profiles for kids.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.380]   So basically, it's all under my control.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.180]   I can see, I get notified.
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.280]   There are a lot of tools out there
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.980]   that are designed that way now.
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:57.980]   And even, so this is as a general principle.
[00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:04.780]   So I don't let them have their own account
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.040]   under a certain age.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:10.640]   And sometimes that will, I will change that rule
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.980]   depending on the maturity of the child.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.560]   The other one is all of the passwords.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.520]   And the login IDs, passwords, they're all written down.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:25.600]   So we can at any time go in there,
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.640]   browse around and check to see what's going on.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:33.520]   The other aspect is that I do have,
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.360]   and not everyone's in the same situation,
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.260]   but I do have a lot of kids in the house.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.160]   And they do spy on each other a lot.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.840]   So if somebody's involved in something they shouldn't be,
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.640]   it's very hard to keep that a secret.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.320]   And of course my wife and I work from home,
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.440]   so there's a double layer of that.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.760]   It doesn't mean that every once in a while,
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.640]   I think recently one of our kids got into a chat line
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.640]   that was totally fine.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.800]   But teenagers being teenagers,
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.000]   somebody's gonna cross the line
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.740]   and start saying inappropriate things.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:08.220]   A lot of them have now filters and blockers.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.960]   But sometimes people are just out of control
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.960]   and will catch on to that.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.680]   It's like, you know, you need to watch it there
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.220]   or we're gonna shut it down.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.800]   So my point is that as parents, you have a lot of control.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.800]   We're not afraid to go deleting like Instagram.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.040]   What do we have on?
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.720]   Okay, we just added our 14 year old.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.920]   Let him have his own account on Instagram.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.800]   Everybody else is out of the house.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.520]   Some kids can handle it better than others, to be honest.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.760]   It's not straightforward.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.000]   It's not like everybody behaves the same way.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.320]   And there was one child in particular at one time
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.600]   that just had a hard time handling it.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.980]   And I think if they post something that they shouldn't have,
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.540]   I'm not afraid to go in there, log in and delete it.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:59.440]   So I guess I've gotten better.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.440]   I've gotten much better with the kids coming down.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.300]   Kind of half joking, but half serious.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.680]   I own everything you have.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.660]   I own you, I own your accounts, I own your passwords.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.720]   I own even the money that you made.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:18.760]   And all of that will go away if you cross the line too far.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.280]   I mean, it's not something I say that often,
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.760]   but they get the message.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.580]   So I haven't actually had to say it as much,
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.560]   but I think at one point, I think I did tell one of my boys,
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:35.300]   it's like, I don't wanna be embarrassed
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.200]   by having to tell you something I saw on your social media.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.960]   It's embarrassing and it's awkward for me
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.840]   and it's awkward for you.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.020]   Let's not have that conversation.
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.760]   So I think that that is helpful.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.360]   And usually I'm sure it's gonna involve boys or girls.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.620]   And no one wants to have that conversation with their parent
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:55.720]   if they can get in there and monitor the conversation.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:02.800]   So I guess I have a pretty high tolerance
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.800]   and the fact that you can get into their accounts.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.020]   And of course, wives are even more
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.360]   they're not afraid.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.040]   I'm a little more embarrassed to go in and check.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.120]   My wife is not.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.820]   So I think that you just have to have that confidence.
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.560]   So I think the big, when I hear horror stories,
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.980]   I'm baffled because like, well,
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.860]   how can a person get into a situation like this
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:32.340]   unless they're completely unmonitored?
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.380]   That does not make sense to me.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.780]   So if a person puts something inappropriate
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:41.180]   on their Instagram and they're a child in your home,
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.980]   why wouldn't you as soon as you find out,
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.380]   which you will find out immediately,
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.300]   because people will ping you or let you know,
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.820]   or you can scroll through it quickly,
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:53.340]   you can delete it on the spot and block the account
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.220]   and or delete the whole account.
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.640]   And that is a tremendous amount of power.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.980]   They don't wanna lose that.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:05.740]   So I think I had one child that was just hashtag crazy
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.820]   and they were very, very naive.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:11.780]   They would put normal hashtags that were tied
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.940]   to very inappropriate stuff and this would attract
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.860]   all sorts of creeps and stuff and I'd have to go in there,
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.700]   delete all the hashtags and explain to you,
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:20.460]   can't use this hashtag.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:25.140]   And then I had to, at one point,
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.420]   we haven't had that problem in a while,
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.860]   so we must be doing things really well,
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:30.620]   but I had to go through, I'll go randomly through
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.980]   and look at all the profiles of people following them
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.740]   and I'll block them or report them.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:38.340]   But honestly, that has not been a great problem
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.660]   simply because the kids are aware of it,
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.140]   they tell each other, we're aware of it,
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:46.060]   we're social media savvy ourselves.
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:50.540]   So I'd say that that would be the,
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.700]   I didn't follow that particular scandal,
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.100]   but when you said the daughter posted,
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.220]   how old was the daughter?
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.340]   - She's 15, she's 15, it's really sad.
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:02.340]   It's a political scandal because, and she's 15.
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:03.500]   - 15.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:08.300]   - So I mean, I guess something like that,
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.740]   you'd probably know within seconds
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.860]   if you're a high profile person,
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.100]   if your daughter posted something.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:14.660]   - It's international news.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.740]   - I mean, it should have been deleted immediately.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.580]   - Right, it's rather evident
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.980]   that the parents don't have control
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:23.020]   and you have a fractured couple
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.620]   and the parents just simply don't have control.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.260]   - Yeah, so that's maybe what I want,
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.060]   okay, maybe now that we're saying that
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.460]   a little more clearly here,
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.780]   I think that that's what happens.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:34.460]   I mean, whether it's social media or not,
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.660]   I mean, and social media will magnify the problems,
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:38.300]   I agree with that.
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.820]   But if you're taking care of your children,
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.900]   you're watching them and you care about them,
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:46.100]   then I think you will take ownership of it.
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.660]   And there will be some awkward conversations.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:50.940]   You know, we've had those where,
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:53.820]   you know what, you don't need to put that picture of you
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:57.900]   in such an undressed state on Instagram.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.900]   I know you're getting a lot more likes,
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.020]   but let's have a conversation
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.820]   about why you're getting more likes.
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.300]   And it's not, you're not,
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.060]   they haven't really crossed the line as such,
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.060]   but you're getting early on the signals,
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.820]   you know what, this is something,
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.820]   you know, you can dress like this,
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.260]   you're in your home, you know,
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.600]   or in an appropriate situation,
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.900]   but when you're putting it on media like this,
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:19.100]   as you notice, there's already more people liking it
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.380]   and they're not here because of your intellect.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:22.940]   So yeah, that's what I mean
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.420]   by having those awkward conversations.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.500]   So I guess you gradually groom and it's like,
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.660]   oh, okay, I get it.
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:32.660]   And rather than this one big, you know,
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:35.420]   thing where you didn't know that your daughter
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.380]   has been posting, you know,
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.380]   half nudie pictures for the last six months.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.140]   I mean, how can you not know that?
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.180]   And how can, and usually by the time you get to that point,
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.800]   things are creeping up.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.580]   So I want to tell, I guess what I'm trying to say
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.380]   is that good parents out there, don't be so scared.
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.220]   'Cause I think half the time when you hear these stories
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.380]   is 'cause parents haven't been to the task.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.660]   And I mean, to the task,
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:56.700]   I don't mean you need to be a wizard.
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.500]   I mean, just be a normal mom and dad.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.340]   It's like, hey, those shorts are too short.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:06.140]   You know, you're around your house, around the family, fine.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.380]   But you can't go in public like that, okay?
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.500]   And you know, well, I don't understand, you know.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.180]   Well, it doesn't matter if you understand or not.
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.580]   Picture's going down, you know.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:18.460]   And you don't wait for things to build up to that point.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:19.940]   So I guess I want to tell people
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:21.220]   you don't have to be that scared.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:23.460]   It can be scary, but you don't have to be that scared.
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.000]   I think it's just like other things in life.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.300]   You're monitoring, you know,
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.700]   I guess you hear horror stories.
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.700]   We didn't know our kid was on drugs for the last two years.
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.600]   And I'm like, well.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.180]   (laughs)
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.540]   Everybody else is seeing that he's out of it.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.780]   He's missing school.
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:41.020]   He can't concentrate.
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.660]   I mean, did you even take him to the doctor
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:44.100]   if you didn't think it was drugs?
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.300]   You know, and then it comes out, of course,
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.500]   well, no one was home.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.820]   He was a latchkey kid.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:51.140]   Okay, well, then that's the underlying problem
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.620]   is that there's no one supervising someone
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.580]   until they get to that level.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.260]   So it's not, in other words, it's scary
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.260]   to think of the end result of someone
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:01.580]   who's left to their own devices,
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.700]   but that's the whole point while you're the parent.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:04.540]   So have courage.
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:05.820]   You can make a difference.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.780]   - And I would buttress what you're saying
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.980]   with a simple observation that I think in many cases
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:15.940]   it can be more damaging and more harmful
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.900]   to have a zero tolerance policy
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:22.940]   because what happens is your child may not develop
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:27.460]   the appropriate skills of learning how to handle something.
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.520]   You know, if you say, no, you're not gonna have
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.480]   any social media, and then all of a sudden
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.420]   your child turns 18, and then they've gotta go out
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.660]   as an 18-year-old and figure out,
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.180]   starting from zero, how to handle it,
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.260]   they can make a lot of mistakes.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.340]   This is actually one of the things
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:43.340]   that really bothers me about American drinking culture
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:47.380]   that in my observation, like in the United States,
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:51.620]   we don't have a healthy way of teaching children
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:56.620]   about alcohol, and it's especially hard
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:00.140]   for those of us who try to be very thoughtful of the laws,
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.500]   but because children are artificially excluded
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.980]   from the consumption of alcohol,
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:07.220]   I'm convinced that in some way it leads
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.100]   to excessive consumption of alcohol
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.180]   once they reach a point where they can do it freely,
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.080]   whether they're underage and just out of the house
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.580]   or of age, and it leads to excessive levels
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:16.900]   of alcohol abuse.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:21.180]   And so I think that in a lot of things,
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:23.980]   I wanna be the one to teach my children about alcohol.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:28.700]   I wanna be the one to teach my children about social media.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.060]   Everything that's touchy and difficult,
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.980]   I wanna be the one to teach them about,
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.900]   and I wanna do it in an appropriate way
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:38.620]   where when they fall, they fall early enough
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:41.460]   and they fall soft enough while they're part of my house
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.900]   that I can lift them up and I can teach them,
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:46.500]   okay, that's what it feels like when you fall.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.740]   That's not good, let's avoid that in the future.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:52.460]   And so I'm not an advocate of a no social media,
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.500]   no anything policy.
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.020]   I think that would be harmful.
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:58.860]   But I do think that obviously it's a subject
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:02.540]   that needs to be considered really carefully.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.660]   So you said you're a 14-year-old now.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.100]   And by the way, we didn't clarify,
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.500]   you have, is it eight children or nine children?
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.960]   - Nine. - Nine, okay.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.100]   So that's what's so beneficial about,
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.860]   I've learned over the years, when I had one child,
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.780]   I was the king of giving out parenting advice.
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:21.420]   I was like, I got this all figured out.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.660]   And since then, having had three more,
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:27.180]   I have learned that I don't know much of anything.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.500]   And so I've come to the point where it's very hard
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.540]   for me to listen to parents of one or two children
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:35.140]   about anything because they just don't have enough diversity
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:37.860]   in their families to understand that children are different.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.020]   So I appreciate the fact that you've got the perspective
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.860]   of nine children to share that perspective.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.580]   So with your 14-year-old, you said,
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:47.400]   Dodd, now you're 14-year-old to have an Instagram account,
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.740]   but your younger one's not yet?
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.060]   - Well, and I should add, in this particular situation,
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:54.500]   it's a private account.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.540]   - Okay.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:57.220]   - So it's an Instagram private account,
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:02.220]   and he's very social, he's very intelligent.
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:08.980]   So I'm not worried about the naive part
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:10.340]   where predators find him.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:13.660]   But at the same time, in this particular situation,
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:16.540]   he has a public blog that's related
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.560]   to writing about his talent.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.320]   And that one's totally public.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.720]   And no creeps are coming there,
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.000]   'cause really no one wants to know about podcast editing
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.280]   unless they really want to know about podcast editing.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:29.700]   So that's a whole other strategy, by the way,
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.940]   in terms of talent, we can discuss that.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:35.720]   But if you get involved deeply into a skill set
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.320]   of any kind, whether it be hot rods,
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:41.240]   or whether it be math, you're going to start gravitating
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.920]   automatically socially to people in those same circles,
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.280]   which is gonna give you those social boundaries
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.880]   automatically.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.880]   The danger is when people are just sort of randomly roaming.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:57.040]   I like to give the analogy, when your wife goes shopping,
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.600]   even if it's in a big city, we all know
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.420]   there are some dangerous parts of the town,
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.880]   and then there are some completely acceptable parts
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.720]   of the town.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.060]   And if she's gonna go shopping in this particular area,
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:09.540]   she can get her latte, she can do this, she can do that,
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.400]   she's gonna be safe going to her car.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.000]   But if she would go to another part of town,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.600]   you'd be afraid of her walking on her own,
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.840]   and people avoid that.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.900]   So I liken it to, it's like with teenagers,
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.520]   like if you say, "Hey, just go into the city,
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.960]   "but just randomly stop anywhere," you'd be afraid,
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.480]   and you wouldn't tell your teenage daughter.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.880]   It's like, you always ask that question,
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.720]   "Where are you going?"
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.240]   A grown adult knows that instinctively,
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.160]   a teenager doesn't.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.720]   You know, "Oh, somebody's calling me over there.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.000]   "Oh, they think I'm pretty."
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.520]   And you're like, "Oh my goodness,
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.520]   "tell me where you're going.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.320]   "I'm going here, there, in the city."
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.700]   It's like, "I'm fine, I'm relaxed."
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.540]   When they go there, the social environment
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:43.940]   is gonna provide that protection.
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:46.260]   People are there usually for a purpose.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:49.060]   So that's the analogy, a little bit I like to think of.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:50.740]   If your child is really into math,
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.140]   they're gonna join math forums,
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.480]   they're gonna join math clubs.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.700]   All that is going to help give those social boundaries.
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.680]   It's when kids are just sort of bouncing randomly
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.860]   over the internet, going from one thing to the next,
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.460]   that's when they expose themselves to danger.
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.780]   So that's the way I like,
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.680]   and we do that instinctively in real life.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.020]   There are parts of our nearby city
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:14.020]   that I'd be very afraid for my wife to walk around
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.260]   just casually for just strolling.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:18.300]   But when she goes, I never worry about her going to town
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.860]   'cause she's either going shopping, she's seeing a friend,
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:23.840]   you're going to a park to meet other moms,
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:26.180]   and so already the other moms have determined
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.020]   that the park is safe.
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:28.680]   You know, that's what I mean by the social boundaries
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.520]   are done for you automatically.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.400]   But with our 14-year-old,
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.980]   it came because he went to a special choir camp.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.340]   He wants to develop his voice.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:43.220]   He likes voice acting, and this came up.
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.540]   He had enough money saved, it was expensive,
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.140]   and we wanted to develop his voice a little bit more.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.940]   He went to a choir, he made some fantastic friends,
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:52.220]   friends about his age, they were very motivated.
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:57.140]   Parents were very, very motivated,
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.260]   and then after the camp, everybody wanted to stay in touch,
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.580]   and he sold me on it.
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:02.660]   It's like, I like to have my Instagram account
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.160]   because all the guys at the choir camp were there,
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.640]   and we wanted to stay in touch, and I'm like,
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.760]   no, it's about time for him to start,
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:11.760]   but I didn't, I was kind of like,
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.560]   I was like, oh, okay, but is this really,
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.880]   you know, gonna get you, and he says,
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.720]   well, I can make it private, sold.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.760]   (laughs)
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.560]   So, you know, that might change at some point.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.520]   He's not really doing his talent on Instagram.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.440]   He's got a blog for that.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:30.640]   I'd like to see him do that eventually on Instagram,
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.860]   and at that point, I might make it public
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.800]   because then the social field is narrowed
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.560]   to people who are interested in this specific topic
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.920]   or subject, and I lost track of what I was trying
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.960]   to say here, but I guess--
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.800]   - You were saying that 14 feels like about the right age,
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.560]   that, okay, this is a reasonable age.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.920]   - Yeah, to start experimenting, exactly,
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.880]   but in that case, he's even on a private status,
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.080]   which means people can't randomly find him
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.160]   unless he's invited them specifically.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.840]   - I like what you said about going
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.880]   to a specific part of town, and what that makes me think of
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.760]   is that it's a good way of staying busy, right?
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.400]   Idle hands are the devil's playground,
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:18.400]   and recently in our family's extended family,
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:23.840]   there was a really tragic story of a young teen
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.120]   who went down some very dark and very, very difficult paths
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:37.080]   that have inalterably affected her life
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.080]   with physical illness at this point in time
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.600]   due to some of her poor choices,
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.520]   and when I talked and kind of gathered information
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:49.480]   on how did this happen, a lot of it just happened,
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.620]   I think, with idleness online, and you follow this down,
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:57.760]   and then just idleness, and so it just reaffirmed in me
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.920]   as I was talking about it with my wife,
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:02.720]   I said, I want my children to be busy, busy, busy,
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.920]   never, you know, work, work, work,
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.040]   because that work gives all those
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.720]   positive psychological benefits,
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.440]   and it serves as a good safeguard,
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.240]   and so if I'm going to the internet,
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.480]   I know this is where I'm going,
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.700]   and I'm busy with all of these forums
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:17.200]   that are related to my passion, my talent,
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:21.360]   and then we'll expand out at some point down the road,
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.460]   but I think that's a really valuable point that you made,
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.180]   where it's not just, and I think it's also
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:29.420]   a really valuable point of bringing out the talent,
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:31.780]   you know, in my mind, back to the academics
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.860]   that we talked about, in my mind,
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:35.260]   I don't see why there has to be a conflict.
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.780]   If a student has 168 hours in a week,
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:40.460]   that's a lot of time.
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:42.380]   You take out a good proper sleep schedule,
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:46.060]   it still really is a lot of time to go really deep
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.860]   and develop a talent and a passion
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.900]   and something that's useful to the world
[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:53.160]   while simultaneously being a rockstar academic as well.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.920]   I see no reason why they have to suffer.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:58.940]   The other things can give way, in my opinion.
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:05.680]   To kind of start to wrap up here, Jonathan,
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.560]   I want to ask you about
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:18.720]   your family business.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.860]   How you and your wife run a family business,
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:26.000]   which I'm blanking on the name of,
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.580]   even though my wife loves your stuff.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.420]   - Oh, it's Madeon.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.380]   It's okay, yeah, yeah. - Madeon.
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:30.500]   Madeon Lotion, okay.
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.500]   - Also known as Hard Lotion.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.180]   - She loves your stuff.
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.780]   She uses all your skincare stuff.
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:40.380]   It's a line of natural, very super,
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.020]   uber crunchy, natural beeswax stuff
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.400]   with good skincare products.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:49.240]   And your wife is very good at running that.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.960]   How have you involved your children in the family business
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.220]   as part of the talent?
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.940]   Has that been a factor or not really a factor?
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.020]   - Yes, actually it's been a big factor.
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:03.700]   One of the part of my philosophy is that
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:07.620]   families have a lot of assets on their hand.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:11.340]   I don't mean just physical assets like a car or a chainsaw.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:16.140]   But you also have social assets, business assets,
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.740]   a way of thinking, a way of life
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.780]   that sometimes can be pretty advanced.
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.020]   So in our case, because we are a home business
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.860]   and trying to keep the cost down,
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:27.100]   and since we switched late in life doing this,
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.460]   so we didn't do this for too many years
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:30.500]   before switching to this,
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.060]   so we had a lot of things to learn.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.380]   We needed our kids.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:38.660]   And a simple example is a lot of the products
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:39.780]   need stickers put on them.
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.540]   It's a simple job.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:43.100]   You need to have clean hands.
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:47.180]   You need to get it centered, and you need to move quickly.
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:48.980]   And when our orders come in,
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:52.220]   a lot of times they will come in in bursts.
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:55.220]   We'll have seasons of sales and seasons where it's slow.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:58.020]   So typically in the fall, which will be coming up here,
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:01.400]   the sales will come in fast and furious.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:06.400]   And so we may, at the end of the day,
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.660]   maybe at six, seven, eight o'clock,
[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.620]   we'll say, "Okay, kids, we need to put some stickers
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.960]   "on all these boxes.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.280]   "We'll throw in a few bucks,
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.540]   "whatever it is we agree."
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.940]   Usually they want snacks instead of money.
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:23.000]   And we'll play a book on audio
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.820]   that they all like to listen to.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.820]   And they just love that.
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:30.100]   And so as we have done that kind of stuff,
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.120]   as they've gotten older,
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.580]   sometimes they'll get a little more complex.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.220]   One of them has gotten into shipping.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:35.980]   They've really, there's all sorts of issues
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.540]   with shipping packages.
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:40.740]   There's a, you get software,
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:42.260]   and it weighs it for you automatically.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:44.660]   There's all these little details
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.660]   that need to be worked out.
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.420]   And we've had quite a few of our teenagers
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:52.220]   work that process,
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.100]   and they've been very efficient.
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:55.580]   And in the process of doing that,
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:59.860]   they understand cost and the details of shipping
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:02.060]   and the problems of things not being tracked
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.380]   or customers being upset
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.820]   because the wrong order was put in the package,
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:10.220]   the importance of cleanliness, of speed,
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:13.740]   why, for example, we're waiting to buy
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:18.740]   this particular tent or toy that we've all wanted,
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:20.460]   but I'll typically say something like,
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:21.300]   well, not yet.
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.540]   We've got to wait until the sales campaign is over.
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:24.540]   And then from this,
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.220]   we'll have enough money then to get that.
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:27.420]   So they've been conditioned,
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:31.220]   gradually over time, to associate work with reward
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:34.020]   and not to have rewards unless there is work,
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:36.900]   as in a general sense of the word.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:40.960]   And that has really been effective.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:43.500]   I see that as the kids leave.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.140]   I see that more as when they leave the household,
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.260]   all these little things that they do on their own
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.300]   just blows me away.
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:51.260]   I didn't do that at that age.
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:54.860]   They're very aware of how to save money,
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:56.700]   how not to get into debt,
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:57.860]   how to negotiate.
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.420]   They're just super savvy.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.380]   I didn't quite see that when they were under my household
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:03.700]   simply because we control everything.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:04.620]   But once they left,
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:06.660]   they just completely took those habits with them.
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.100]   So I would say that that has been a huge benefit to them.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:14.340]   It's just the practical details of running a small business
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:16.460]   that they've taken with them.
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:17.300]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:18.660]   I definitely think that,
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.620]   back to that sense of meaning and purpose,
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:24.360]   to me, one of the most valuable reasons
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.660]   to have some kind of small family business,
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:30.980]   even if it's not the primary source of family revenue,
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:34.760]   is so that children have a chance to understand
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.100]   how money is made,
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.540]   how money is managed,
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:40.480]   how to, just all those little lessons.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:44.740]   And to me, that's definitely a really crucial part
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:49.140]   of what I want to be present in my children's education.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:54.140]   And I like how the talent gives them even their own thing
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:57.060]   that they can do and generate real money
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.180]   from a very early age.
[01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:01.060]   I think that we're living in a time
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:04.020]   where for parents with wisdom,
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:07.100]   with foresight, with perspective,
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:10.100]   there are more opportunities available for children now
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:11.220]   than there have ever been
[01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:15.800]   to produce things that are genuinely useful to the world.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:18.060]   If I think about the scope of human history,
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:21.060]   there was a time in which children's labor
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.140]   was helpful to the family farm.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:25.880]   But then we moved out of the farm into an industrial age.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.300]   And so society took that idea
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.460]   that children would work on the farm
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:32.300]   and they put it into factory work.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:36.140]   But factory work wasn't a great environment for children.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:37.540]   Lots of dangers, et cetera.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:38.660]   And so you had the imposition
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:41.700]   of massive child labor laws, et cetera.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.140]   Well, what those laws had the result of doing
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:46.240]   was taking children out of the workforce
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.260]   and putting them into the school environment.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.160]   I'm not sure that was much healthier for them,
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.840]   but at least they probably lost fewer arms and legs,
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.020]   generally speaking.
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.940]   So then what happened?
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:02.340]   Well, then work for children became stupid work.
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:03.780]   You couldn't really well take your child
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:04.820]   into the office with you.
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:08.660]   And so your child did something that was relatively modest.
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:09.980]   And I shouldn't have used the word stupid.
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:10.820]   That was wrong.
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.260]   'Cause it's not stupid to learn
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:14.180]   how to provide good customer service
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.340]   working at an ice cream shop.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.740]   It's not stupid to learn how to be an effective lifeguard.
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:20.340]   I wish I hadn't said that word.
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:22.580]   But it just largely became very limiting,
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.500]   especially very intellectually limiting.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:29.500]   And we created these massive hurdles
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.940]   for somebody to access the labor force.
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.060]   And if they can access the labor force,
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:35.020]   they need a college degree from this institution.
[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:36.980]   And they need this number of years of experience.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:40.300]   And so the marketplace of ideas,
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:43.780]   sorry, the marketplace of work became an adult only zone
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:45.400]   where maybe there was one day a year
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.940]   when you could take your child to school, but that was it.
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:48.860]   But what's happening,
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:50.780]   especially now that we're all sitting in our houses,
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:53.020]   working in our houses, all of us,
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:54.660]   that now I think that there's something more
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:55.500]   coming back to that.
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:56.660]   And it's exciting.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:57.660]   I think one of the good things
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.980]   that I'm hoping comes out of this environment
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.220]   is fewer latchkey kids
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.940]   and more of an ability for children
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:05.780]   to be involved in the work of their parents,
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:07.420]   for them to see what their parents do,
[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:10.580]   for them to listen when dad's on a conference call,
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:12.540]   for them to say, "Mom, I can help you
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.680]   "with that thing that you're working on.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.740]   "I can do that."
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:17.280]   And to start to develop useful skills again
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.420]   that can be useful.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.940]   And then as work is more dispersed,
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:26.600]   it opens up the opportunity for young people
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.300]   to access the labor market.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:32.300]   Your daughter can sell her art projects on Etsy
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:35.940]   just as well at the age of 17 as at the age of 37,
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:37.660]   in some cases better at 17,
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.720]   because there's a market that a 37-year-old
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.100]   might not be tuned into.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:43.260]   Your son, when he was selling knives on Instagram,
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:45.180]   he can access a global marketplace
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.940]   just the same as anybody else.
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.900]   And so one of the things I'm happy about
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:51.620]   is that there's this crumbling of these walls
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.740]   that have been erected
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:56.140]   so that now children can see the fruit of their labor
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:57.780]   and actually be able to access it.
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:59.940]   And I think this is really a good thing for our children
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.380]   because, like with my children,
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:02.620]   when I encourage business things,
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.900]   especially since they're not online yet,
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.860]   it's very limited in terms of what they can do
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.520]   because you're very limited to the markets
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.380]   that you can access.
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:10.500]   I've encouraged my son
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.060]   and helped him with a little bread business.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:13.300]   Well, he can do that,
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.880]   but he's not gonna be a baker necessarily,
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.460]   I don't think, at this point in time.
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.980]   So you've got a little bit of local access.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:22.620]   But after a time, maybe your neighbors
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:24.660]   don't really care to buy your bread anymore.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:27.660]   But when you can cross over and move to the digital platform
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:29.260]   even if you're selling physical products
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.360]   in the digital world,
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.820]   it opens up the world to that individual entrepreneur,
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.660]   which means that now your 15-year-old,
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:37.740]   your 17-year-old, your 20-year-old
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:40.800]   has the ability to access the world's marketplace,
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.300]   which is really exciting with regard to their ability
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:46.260]   to actually generate good money for themselves.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.260]   And then that means that when they're 18
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:51.100]   and they finish up and perhaps move out of your house,
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:52.520]   at that point in time,
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.420]   they're not going into the world as an unskilled laborer
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:58.060]   making $7.50 an hour,
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.240]   dipping ice cream at the local ice cream shop.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.940]   They're going into the world as a skilled craftsman,
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.980]   as a skilled professional,
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:08.180]   and they're able to generate massive levels of income
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:10.700]   or at least significant levels of income
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:11.660]   with the potential to lead
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:13.860]   to massive levels of income quickly.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:16.980]   And now when you take even that head start,
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:18.620]   and I've run the calculations on this,
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:20.580]   and you say, let's say that my 18-year-old
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:23.020]   can save $15,000 a year
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:24.660]   because they're earning a good amount of money.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:26.820]   Maybe they could save $20,000 a year.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:28.560]   That 18-year-old by the age of 30
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:30.420]   can knock the socks off the guy
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.460]   who's sitting in college now for four years,
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:36.180]   earning nothing, extending adolescence unnecessarily
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.620]   just to come out and get that entry-level job.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:41.800]   So it's exciting that we can use these platforms
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.500]   to help our children access a global marketplace
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:48.960]   and build real, genuine businesses at a young age.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.580]   So, Jonathan, I've covered most of what I wanted to cover.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.220]   As you think about giving advice to me,
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.780]   to a young father, to my listeners,
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:59.100]   who, again, many of whom are homeschooling their children
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:00.540]   for the first time,
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:02.460]   take a few minutes and just walk over
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:04.180]   an overview of your philosophy
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:07.940]   and what you would say a parent needs to consider
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:09.780]   if they really wanna help their child
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:13.380]   to develop their talents, to pursue their passions,
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:15.540]   so that they can bring something useful to the world.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.940]   Walk us through just your general overview
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.840]   of advice that you would give to me,
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.300]   a young parent, as we go.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.300]   - Yeah, I would say,
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:27.900]   from until about the age of 12,
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:31.540]   I think you are best concentrating
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:33.540]   on the old traditional basics,
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:36.580]   and which is a lot more nurture-oriented.
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:39.180]   A lot of the stuff that you're learning
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.620]   in your school program is gonna be very basic.
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:42.860]   You're gonna learn your alphabet,
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:45.500]   obviously you're gonna learn how to read basic books,
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.460]   your basic math, and so forth.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.500]   And about the age of 12,
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.900]   give or take, depending on the homegrown maturity,
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:57.820]   the parents' approval and disapproval
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.900]   is really what's going to motivate them
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:03.060]   to go forward and make all the difference in the world.
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.940]   What the rest of the world thinks about
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.940]   really does not affect them.
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:10.100]   And I think that's, in our household,
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:12.300]   that's typically where mom has a bigger role.
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:15.500]   It's gonna be a lot more of the hugging and encouragement
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.620]   and the typical things that we think about
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:20.700]   where we have to be pretty gentle with them.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.700]   But starting around age 12,
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:24.580]   you know, between 12 and 14,
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:26.820]   all of a sudden you see this awakening.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.100]   Some people see this awakening,
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.460]   it almost seems like a rebellion.
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:31.660]   It could be, it could turn into a rebellion,
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:33.100]   where they start becoming headstrong.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.660]   They don't want just a hug.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:37.740]   They don't wanna just say, "Because mom said,"
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.220]   or, "Because you like it."
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:40.820]   They wanna know, "Do other people
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:42.700]   "care about what I am doing?"
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:44.940]   And they'll start thinking big thoughts.
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:47.140]   You know, "Do I care about what I'm doing?"
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:47.980]   Big thoughts.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.260]   You know, "One day I wanna become this."
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:50.740]   And they mean that seriously.
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:53.780]   Excuse me.
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.900]   And that's a sign there that they have a need
[01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:59.540]   for something bigger than themselves.
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:01.580]   And you need to tap into that.
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:03.620]   So what I would do, especially 'cause they're still young,
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:04.900]   even though they have big thoughts,
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.980]   they still need their family's encouragement.
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.780]   It's hard to break into the world without being crushed.
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:13.860]   And what I would recommend is you look for something
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.820]   in your environment, your family environment.
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:19.460]   Maybe you live in an unusual part of the world
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:21.780]   that has, you know, you have access to something unusual
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:23.940]   that no one else, very few people do.
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:26.540]   Or maybe your grandpa lives next door
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:28.660]   and he's got this amazing workshop.
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:31.900]   Or maybe your dad, like Joshua Sheets,
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:34.260]   he's got a podcast studio.
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:36.780]   Maybe you could start by using some of those tools
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:39.460]   and explore an interest that you have.
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:41.700]   And then as a family, as parents,
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.660]   you start giving them a chance to
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:48.460]   showcase that interest, right?
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:51.260]   So just to use an analogy, if I were you, Joshua,
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:54.060]   and you had a child who's starting to become 12, 13,
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:57.820]   maybe you have a precocious daughter who likes to chat a lot.
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:00.020]   She likes to chat people up.
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.380]   You say, "Hey, have you thought of interviewing
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:03.140]   "Grandma so-and-so or Uncle so-and-so
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.180]   "who was, you know, in World War II,
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.020]   "he's getting really old.
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:09.260]   "Maybe you could interview him and ask him how it was."
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:10.660]   And she's like, "Oh yeah, I'd love to do that."
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:14.100]   So in one shot, she's connecting with a relative.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:15.780]   She gets to use your tool.
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.580]   She doesn't really have a long-term plan.
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:19.340]   She does it, and then you listen to it,
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:22.020]   and you know, it's a little disjointed here and there,
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:23.860]   but there's some interesting moments in there,
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:26.880]   some tenderness, and you could take that, for example,
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.380]   and say, "Hey, let's just edit this a little bit.
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:30.600]   "Let me show you how to edit it here.
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.340]   "There's this part, the big coughing spell here
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.580]   "with Grandpa, let's edit that out a little bit.
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:36.540]   "I'll show you how to do it," you know, simple stuff.
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:38.520]   "And then let's load that up to Dropbox
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.320]   "and send it to all our relatives."
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.940]   And that would be fairly easy to do.
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:47.900]   It goes out, and sure enough, we did something like that
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:51.140]   for friends of ours, and this friend came back,
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:55.700]   and he says, "Oh, I had ants that were crying of joy
[01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:58.740]   "because they had heard this thing."
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:01.000]   I was a little taken aback that they were moved by that,
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.860]   but the point was, this was something important
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:06.580]   to their family, and it was easy to do,
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:09.100]   and all of us have something like that in our lives
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:12.240]   that seems so, you do it every day.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.520]   And as you do podcasting every day,
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:15.940]   you can almost think, "Ah, it's no big deal."
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:19.060]   It is a big deal, but if you could tie it into your child's,
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:22.020]   a little bit of your child's strength,
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.780]   like she's a chatter, let's say,
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:26.180]   then have her chat with all these great relatives.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:29.660]   Ask them about their stories, put it on a little website.
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:32.100]   All the relatives will go bonkers over it,
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:35.040]   and she'll get massive feedback.
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.620]   You know, maybe everybody, and then she finds out,
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.420]   oh, everybody wants to hear about war stories.
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:43.280]   So, you know, at first it was about swimming in Wisconsin,
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.560]   and she gets okay feedback, but the war story,
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:46.560]   all the relatives light up,
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.800]   ask them what happened about this.
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.560]   So she says, "Wow, people like war stories."
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.200]   So then she starts graduating
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:53.720]   until she finds out neighbors have war stories.
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:55.520]   So I'm just fantasizing here a bit,
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.240]   but the point is, you want to find something,
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.320]   'cause you're young, right?
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.680]   They're young, you want them protected.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.640]   You don't want them just randomly going on the street,
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:05.760]   interviewing homeless people who are former veterans.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.640]   You don't want to do that.
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.280]   You want to find something in your environment,
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:12.180]   trusted friends, circle of friends, tools,
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:14.980]   and that, you start building that little fire up,
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:17.060]   and that little inner motivation's gonna come up.
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:19.860]   And in the process of acting that out,
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:22.020]   you're gonna find, your daughter, for example,
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:24.020]   would find out where her weaknesses are,
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.780]   and she can decide, you know what, I want to strengthen,
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:27.180]   I want to get rid of those weaknesses.
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.500]   Or she could say, you know what,
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.900]   I don't want to work on those weaknesses,
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.500]   I want to work on these strengths.
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:33.040]   And so you can go in different directions,
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.140]   and you as a parent can kind of guide them,
[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:36.260]   kind of open up the doors.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.980]   You know what, I have a really good friend at work.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.720]   Yeah, you know, he's a safe guy,
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:42.280]   I know he'd be gentle with kids.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.360]   If I talked to him, he'd probably let you interview him.
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:46.360]   So you can start opening doors for your child
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:49.060]   to step out just a little bit further.
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:51.440]   And then you just build and build on that,
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.200]   and maybe you as a parent, you start realizing,
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.760]   okay, she's having a great time, but you know what,
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.340]   I'd like her to develop her writing skills
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:32:59.520]   a little bit more.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.760]   So now you start saying, hey,
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.780]   maybe you should write a little blog summary
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:04.120]   of the interview, you know,
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.400]   and the first ones are a little awkward,
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.120]   some key points are missing,
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.640]   maybe you just start, maybe just do a key list first.
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.440]   And you get her to write about that.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.480]   So little by little, you start developing
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:19.800]   this stackable skillset, and you pivot a little bit,
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:21.160]   you find a little bit where her strengths
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.160]   are and interests are, she starts getting feedback.
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.360]   Pretty soon she starts having ideas of her own,
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:28.780]   and you're thinking, well, I don't know if that would work.
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:30.480]   But you know, let's try it, let's give it a try.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.440]   It's not too risky if it fails.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.880]   And what you do is you start encouraging them
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.960]   to buy their own tools of this skillset
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.800]   that they have, so I'll do this with my kids a lot.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:44.440]   They'll earn money from working in our home business.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:49.000]   And like my 14-year-old, he's been podcast editing
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.720]   for several years now, and he's done voice acting gigs
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.600]   on his own, he's very confident about how to answer
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:56.360]   people back and how to explain to them
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.700]   it's gonna cost more for extra words.
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:01.680]   But he loves spending all his money on microphones,
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:03.480]   and in fact, the one we were working on
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.600]   just before we started, I realized it's so sensitive,
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.040]   I'm like, oh my goodness, I normally don't use with this.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.640]   It picks up everything, it was great for him
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:14.640]   as a voice actor, he's starting, that's the tools he want.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.560]   He spends tons of money on it.
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.920]   In fact, I have to calm him down, it's like,
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.320]   don't spend so much money on these tools, you know?
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.740]   It's the ones you have.
[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:23.960]   But that's what I think you're gonna see this sort of fire
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:28.080]   build up in your kid, and I love, this is my personal
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.040]   satisfaction, I love when a kid comes to me,
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.280]   or teenagers maybe, they're starting to get older,
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.580]   and they have some crazy idea about where they want
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.360]   to take their talent or tool they want to buy,
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.400]   and I'm like, I don't know if that's gonna work, honestly.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.320]   That's a lot of money, or I don't know,
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.280]   this might fail, what you're gonna try to do,
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.640]   and you might be socially embarrassed.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.400]   I'll say something to that effect, and he's like,
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:48.960]   no, no, I think it can be done, you know?
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:53.720]   And it's like, okay, you know, I think, give it a try.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.660]   I really, honestly, I honestly don't know,
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:58.760]   I don't have a crystal ball, go out and try it.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.320]   And they'll go and try it, and sometimes it won't work,
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:05.160]   and they'll learn something from there, or it'll work,
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.560]   and then next time around, they know how to do it better.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:10.520]   So I would say it's a discovery process.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.680]   You embrace who you are as a family,
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.680]   embrace your family culture as a platform for your child
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.280]   to start finding their own unique identity.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:26.240]   So you're not cloning them, but you're giving them
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.080]   a leverage, a chance, your family is a chance for them
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:32.640]   to come on stage and start doing their thing.
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:37.740]   And if you try going, if you try to bypass that,
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.340]   a lot of times they'll just freeze up.
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:40.300]   They won't, they're too scared.
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.820]   They can't put themselves on a platform out there,
[01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:45.700]   figuratively speaking, without being shut down too quickly,
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:47.260]   because honestly, they're not that good,
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:49.680]   and they will get shut down, so people get scared.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.940]   They might eventually get good enough and strong enough,
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:54.980]   but by then they're 17, 18, and they've let four good years
[01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:57.520]   go by, too much time has gone by.
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:59.920]   So you as a parent, you use your family,
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.100]   you use your assets, and then eventually,
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:05.820]   they're gonna start breaking off into their own little
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.500]   orbit, they're gonna start doing little paid jobs
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.300]   for friends, or maybe on the internet,
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:13.220]   they're gonna start going bigger, and then at some point,
[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:16.140]   they say, wow, they start having a real big vision
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:18.940]   for themselves, and then that's where the conversation
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:21.820]   starts, you know, maybe I should take these extra courses.
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:25.900]   Like my daughter said, I wanna pay for this paid
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.100]   subscription of this top artist that I want,
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:30.060]   and that made a huge difference for her.
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:31.580]   But she wasn't ready in the beginning,
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:33.180]   but she got all this feedback from relatives,
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:35.260]   wow, this is good, you've got something here.
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:37.060]   And then at some point, she got so frustrated,
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:41.700]   but my, the children I draw, they always look like
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:46.700]   old adults, old men, and so there was this one artist,
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:52.020]   the lesson was how to make your babies look like babies
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:55.100]   and not like old people, right?
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.920]   And so there's a whole thing, but you had to buy
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:59.380]   his paid course, she had enough money saved up.
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:01.740]   She got it, once she got into that, all of a sudden,
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:03.820]   a whole new world opened up, here's somebody super
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:08.820]   professional, super kind, could explain themselves,
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:12.180]   they explain how it worked, and as they were drawing
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:15.700]   and teaching, they would also explain how it worked
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:17.180]   to sell your art, and things like that,
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:18.980]   you got socialized into it.
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:23.980]   So you have this momentum that just takes you forward.
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:26.900]   But in the beginning, you start with your family,
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:28.980]   start looking around what you got, start looking
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:32.380]   at relatives who can help you, or who have an asset,
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.260]   or a dad who has a microphone like Joshua Sheets,
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:39.140]   and say, is there something I can use here, right?
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:41.620]   And then you start discovering that, and you morph,
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:44.460]   and you morph, and you morph, you have to make money
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:47.340]   off of it, if at all possible, and then you have them
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:50.340]   use their money to build more of their talent.
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:52.100]   And then you have the conversation as they get closer
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.800]   to 18, you know what, if going to college you think
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:55.460]   is really going to make you go forward,
[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:57.980]   and that's the direction you want to go, then go for it.
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:37:59.700]   But if you think going in a different direction,
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.820]   now they have an idea of what they want to do,
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:04.540]   and become, and that helps guide and makes the decisions
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:07.740]   for them, and gets you completely out of the anxiety zone.
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:10.020]   So that's my speech.
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:13.540]   - I'm excited, I'm looking forward to, you know,
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:18.180]   especially now with an almost seven year old, it's so fun.
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:23.180]   I never had a vision for what to do with babies,
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:26.460]   and so now that my children are reaching an age, though,
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:30.260]   I'm just so filled with, where they're more than babies,
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:32.660]   we can talk about adult level things, I'm just so filled
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:36.460]   with enthusiasm and passion about all the neat things
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:38.260]   we can do together, it's so exciting.
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:42.220]   And I love these ideas even that you're saying.
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:46.700]   I'm looking forward to the day when I can help guide
[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:50.280]   one of my children down some of these paths,
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.820]   and help them get some failures under their belt,
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:54.460]   help them get some wins under their belt,
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:57.180]   and I'm excited.

[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.140]   figure out what it is you're asking,
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:40.560]   and I got tons and tons of tips,
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:44.460]   and some tips work really well for certain type of children,
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:47.780]   some for others, so I love getting questions.
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:51.220]   - Awesome, and then you've also got your older site,
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:53.020]   10K to Talent, that I know you're moving on
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:54.660]   from that particular brand, but there's a bunch
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:55.660]   of resources and information.
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:56.600]   - Yeah, I'm leaving it up.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:57.780]   It's still available.
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:01.580]   It's available, you can go there, 10ktotalent.com.
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:06.580]   You can browse many, many blog posts
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:09.500]   that I've written over time, and it's all in there,
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:12.300]   and what I'm trying to do now is to make it a little more,
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:16.460]   when I talk about these methods, I try to pivot
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:17.900]   a little bit so that it's expressed more
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:19.780]   in what the parents want, so, you know,
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:22.220]   like we were talking about is, you know,
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:25.260]   the way a lot of times to find that inner motivation
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:28.220]   and happiness for children is to find a passion
[01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:31.120]   or a skill set, but of course, what the parents want
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.020]   is more than anything else for them to be happy,
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:35.900]   so I'm trying to match up the method
[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:37.780]   to the result that you're gonna get
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:39.620]   by doing this with your child.
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.940]   - Awesome, awesome.
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.500]   Well, thank you so much for coming on today, Jonathan.
[01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:43.980]   I really appreciate your time.
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:47.460]   - It was my pleasure, thank you.
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:48.780]   - So in closing, what I would encourage you
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:50.940]   is definitely check out Jonathan's resources,
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:53.620]   but most importantly, I think,
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:56.780]   think carefully about your own child,
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:41:00.340]   and recognize that if you're a parent,
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:03.620]   it is your responsibility as a parent
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:05.960]   to help your child to develop the skills
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:09.660]   that they need to succeed in the modern age,
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:13.420]   and maybe, maybe there was a day and time
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:15.060]   at which you could take your children,
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:16.580]   drop 'em off at the local school,
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:17.940]   and come back and pick 'em up,
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:19.340]   and magically 12 years later,
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:22.780]   they would be prepared for life, maybe.
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:25.540]   I'm skeptical, but maybe.
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:29.340]   If there ever was such a time, it ain't today,
[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:30.700]   and so what that means is that
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:34.260]   if you're going to help your child to be more effective,
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:35.680]   you're gonna help your child to do
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.900]   what your child is going to need to do
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:41.180]   to be able to succeed in the modern world,
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:44.580]   then it's going to require more thought and more input,
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:47.460]   and if you reflect back on even what Jonathan said
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:49.180]   at the beginning of what do we want for our children,
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:52.500]   we want them to be happy, and want them to feel fulfilled,
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:57.140]   and to motivation, to be motivated,
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:59.900]   those are his two things, be happy and motivated.
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:01.420]   I think that would be satisfying,
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:04.900]   but there's very little in the mainstream education system
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:07.900]   that's gonna result in happiness and motivation.
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:11.200]   Very rarely do we give our high school children
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.420]   a course on happiness,
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:14.940]   very rarely do we give them a course on motivation,
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:17.660]   and so these are the areas that we as parents
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:19.220]   are responsible to fill in.
[01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:21.860]   So look at your children, engage with your children,
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:24.020]   and help your children to discover some things
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:25.340]   that they're interested in,
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:28.340]   discover, start to develop some skill in those areas,
[01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:30.740]   and you'll put them light years ahead
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:33.580]   of where many of their peers are.
