[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   The words to which I should like to direct your attention this morning are to be found
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.880]   in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6, reading verses 10 to 13.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.480]   Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.360]   Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.640]   For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.160]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:48.400]   Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.080]   and having done all, to stand. Now, having examined at great length the nature of the
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.240]   problem confronting us, the devil and these principalities and powers and so on, we are
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.800]   at the moment trying to understand this exhortation which tells us to be strong in the Lord and in the
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.160]   power of his might. We have seen that there are two main things that the Christian has to do in
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:24.080]   order to stand, in order not to be defeated and to fall down in failure. And the first is this,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.160]   to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. The second is that we must put on the whole
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:39.520]   armor of God. But we are taking the first first, for very good reasons. And in examining what the
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.720]   apostle means exactly when he tells us to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might,
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.040]   we have seen that it includes this kind of thing, that we must realize the character of our problem,
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.360]   we must have measured the enemy. A man who goes to battle, as our Lord points out in a famous
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.000]   parable, without realizing the strength of the enemy and the armaments and men that he will need,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.720]   is a fool. And having realized the strength of the enemy, we will very soon realize our own
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.800]   weakness. And having realized that, we will realize the need of this strength. And so we
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:29.480]   are directed to look at the Lord and to realize that he is indeed the Lord, the power of his
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.040]   might, the strength that is in him inherently, and the manifestation of that. That is the great
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.200]   thing we always must remember. But we have realized it does not stop at that. We have realized that it
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.520]   includes this, that as we are soldiers, as it were, in the Lord's army, that we have a great
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.040]   captain of our salvation. It is his campaign, not ours. Christianity is not a personal, private
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.680]   matter only. Thank God we do have the personal benefits and experiences, but we must remember
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.960]   that it is his campaign, it is his battle. God is involved in all this. The ultimate fight is not
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.280]   men fighting temptations, it is God fighting the devil. It is a great spiritual conflict in high
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.600]   places, heavenly places. Well, that is a great comfort to know that. And then we find further
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:30.280]   that because it is his, he is always around and about us, guarding us, sheltering us, protecting
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.640]   us, and planning the whole strategy of the great campaign. But he is not only working around and
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.720]   about us. We ended last Sunday morning by showing that he is also working in us. Thank God for this.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.560]   This is the thing we will keep on forgetting. Paul has already prayed for these people that
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.360]   they might know the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward that believe. He has reminded
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.240]   them once more that God is able to do for us exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.880]   or think according to the power that worketh in us. This power is working in us, and as Christian
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.560]   people we must never forget that. Very well, we take up at that point. It includes all that. When
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.840]   he says, "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might," he includes understanding all that.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.760]   But he does not stop at that. We now come to what in many ways is the crucial point in this whole
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:38.080]   discussion. We come, in other words, to the practical question. How is all this related to
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:46.560]   us in practice, in our day-to-day needs, in our constant warfare against the world and the flesh
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:58.040]   and the devil? Now that, I say, is the question that troubles so many. How is this exhortation
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:09.400]   of the great apostle to be interpreted precisely and in detail? Now, I say that this is and has
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:17.840]   been a cause of great perplexity and of much confusion to people, conscious of the battle,
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.360]   conscious of being defeated often. They hear this great exhortation, "Be strong in the Lord and in
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:32.960]   the power of his might." Now, what does that mean? How does that really help? What does it tell me to
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.920]   do in reality? Now, that's the right question to ask. I've been pointing out that this is not just
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.440]   some great phrase or some incantation which we repeat. It isn't that. The apostle means to be
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:53.600]   very practical, and there is obviously a practical outworking of this exhortation. Now, what does it
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:01.000]   mean exactly? Well, here, unfortunately, I have to start with a negative, because it's quite clear,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.280]   surely, that with such a vital matter as this, that the enemy should be particularly anxious
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:14.200]   to cause confusion. And he has caused confusion, great confusion. And there are many who are in
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:21.480]   great confusion and perplexity this morning. What does this mean? Well, now, there is a popular
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:30.800]   teaching. It's been popular now, well, for some 90 years almost, which says that it just means
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:38.200]   this, that the great trouble with most of us in the Christian life is that we will go on struggling
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:47.240]   so much, that we will go on fighting, and that therein lies our error and the great cause of
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:54.560]   our defeat. You say, why is it that people don't listen to the exhortation of the apostle? He says,
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:02.040]   "Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might," which they say means this, that all we've
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:12.280]   really got to do is to let go, and to let God do it for us. Now, that's the phrase which, in so many
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:21.400]   ways, summarizes that teaching that has been so popular. Let go, and let God. It's all right. Or
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.720]   another way they have of putting it, here's a phrase that's been repeated and repeated so
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.520]   constantly, "Hand it over to the Lord." It's not your battle, it's his. "Hand it over to him."
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:41.040]   Another one is this, "Let him do it for you." That's what he's offering to do. You see, there's
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.760]   no need to have any struggle. That's your mistake, is that you have gone on struggling and striving,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:54.160]   but it's unnecessary. There's no need to struggle. There's no need to feel any difficulty. Here's
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:00.080]   another phrase, "It's quite simple," they say. "Quite simple. All you have to do is to stop
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:08.640]   struggling. Hand it over." And they have used many illustrations in order to show what they mean.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:15.640]   Here is one, for instance, which has been very popular. They say, "You're like a man in a room,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:22.320]   brilliant sunshine outside in the street, but the room is in semi-darkness. Why? Well,
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.120]   the blinds are drawn. And here's a man fumbling, trying to find his way around the room,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.040]   looking for things. He can't see them. What a tragedy. There's all that brilliant sunshine
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.240]   outside, but here's a man in semi-darkness and in trouble and in confusion. What's he got to do?"
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.120]   Well, they say it's so simple. All he has to do is to let up the blinds, and the sunshine will
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:49.520]   come streaming in, and all his problems will have gone. Quite simple. "Why go on struggling?" they
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.560]   say. Now, this is the teaching which, obviously, we must consider, because it presents itself to
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:02.400]   us as an exposition of the kind of text we are dealing with this morning. So we are told that
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:09.080]   it's something like this, that what is needed, first of all, is some sort of crisis in our lives.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:16.880]   The defeated Christian has got to come to a point of crisis in which he will be ready to admit and
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.680]   to confess his defeat. He's got to start with that, they say. He's hopeless until he does that,
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.840]   and there we're in entire agreement. Then they say, having realized his defeat and having confessed
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:36.600]   it, he must come to this crucial point. Is he ready to surrender himself in this whole battle
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:43.160]   entirely to the Lord? To stop struggling himself, just to hand it right over? Is he prepared to
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:49.640]   surrender? Is he prepared to submit, to give up utterly and absolutely? They say if he is,
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:56.360]   he will pass through a crisis in which he'll lose all the struggle and the strain, and from there on,
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:04.720]   he will go on to a process. And the process comes to this, that having passed through this critical
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:12.000]   experience, all this man has to do now is to go on abiding in the Lord, which means that he has to
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.760]   go on refusing to struggle and to battle himself, and to leave it entirely to the Lord, that the
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.960]   Lord will do it for him. The Lord will take up his problems and all his battles, he'll fight them for
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:29.000]   him. So that this man has nothing to do but to abide in Christ, to go on looking to the Lord.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.440]   He does no struggling himself at all. It will all be done for him. So having passed through the
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:43.320]   crisis, he continues in this process of abiding. Now you're familiar with this teaching, and you
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:49.440]   are familiar furthermore with this, that it is presented in the form of something that one can
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:56.400]   do immediately in a meeting. So often people are called to come forward, to take a decision,
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:03.640]   to decide to accept this offer of victory. So they're called to come forward or hold up their
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:09.000]   hands in the meeting, and it can all happen in this critical experience. And then they go on
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.240]   with this process of abiding in the Lord, and they'll find that their whole life will be entirely
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.160]   different, the stress and the strain will have gone, there'll be no more struggle, it'll be a
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:29.080]   life of victory, on condition that they go on abiding in the Lord. Well now there is the teaching,
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:34.000]   and it's a teaching of course that we obviously have to consider, and to consider very seriously.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:45.040]   There are many who are trying to do this, trying to surrender, trying to be willing to surrender,
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:52.720]   trying to be willing to be made willing, as the phrase goes, to surrender. And thus they
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   spend months and years in this attempt to do this thing which is recommended to them. Others claim
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:06.680]   that they've done this, and as I say that having done so, they find that life has become so simple,
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:15.120]   and all they need to do is to go on looking to the Lord and abiding in him. And they find that
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:21.960]   their battles are fought for them. Well now then, what are we to say to this? It obviously demands
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:29.800]   a serious and earnest attention. Now there are certain reasons I want to put to you,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:39.160]   in an attempt to show you that that teaching is contrary to the plain teaching of the Scripture
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:46.800]   itself. That's the test we must always apply first, the test of the Scripture. Now what do
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.920]   I mean by that? Well I mean this, for instance, if that teaching is correct, well then the very
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:58.080]   second thing that the Apostle tells the Christian to do here is unnecessary. The second thing is,
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:06.680]   put on the whole armor of God. He repeats that in verse 13, "Wherefore take unto you the whole
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:13.880]   armor of God." And he then goes on, of course, from verse 14 onwards, to take these pieces and
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:20.240]   portions of the armor one by one, in order that we may know how to use them. My argument is this,
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.920]   that if the Lord does it all for us, and we've got nothing to do but to abide in him and look to him,
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:32.640]   well then I cannot see that there is any purpose in telling me to put on this armor. For obviously
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:39.360]   the armor is something that I have to use and to employ. So it seems to me immediately to cut
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.280]   right out the thing that the Apostle himself couples with this exhortation to be strong in
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:52.480]   the Lord and in the power of his might. But that's only one illustration of many. This teaching,
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:14:01.560]   it seems to me, makes all the exhortations of the epistles quite unnecessary. Now this is a serious
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:08.240]   matter, and we've got to go into it. I say if this teaching is right, that we have nothing to do,
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.920]   that the mistake is that we've been doing so much that we've got to hand it all over to the Lord.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.640]   Let go, let God do it, let him do it for you, let him fight your battles in you and for you,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:26.440]   and he'll do so. I say if that is true, well then it seems to me that all these exhortations that
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:32.240]   are in the scripture are not only unnecessary, they're wrong. What are they? Well here's one,
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:40.520]   for instance, listen to the epistle of James, chapter 4, verse 7. "Resist the devil and he
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:47.960]   will flee from you." You've got to resist it. It's an exhortation to us to resist the devil.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.760]   We don't, it doesn't tell us that we mustn't resist him, that all we've got to do is to look
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:00.680]   to the Lord and he will resist the devil for us. No, James says you resist the devil and he will
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:07.760]   flee from you. It's an exhortation to us to do something. Then take a parallel in the first
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:14.360]   epistle of Peter, in the fifth chapter, where there is a very clear and specific statement
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:22.600]   made. Listen to this in the first epistle of Peter, beginning to read at verse 9, or indeed at
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:30.960]   verse 8, "Be sober, be vigilant." Because you've got to be vigilant, because your adversary the
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:39.800]   devil is a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour, whom resist, steadfast in
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.800]   the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:52.440]   world. There is an exhortation to us to resist steadfast in the faith. Now there are two
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:59.240]   exhortations without going any further, which come to us and tell us that we've got to be vigilant,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:05.960]   observant, and that we ourselves have got to resist the devil, and it's urging us to do so,
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:16.800]   with all the care and the energy that we can commend. But there are many others. Take the
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:24.560]   Apostle Paul, for instance, in Romans 8, he puts it in an important statement in verse 13, "Here are
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:30.600]   temptations arising in the flesh from within, used by the devil and fomented by the devil. He says,
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:38.280]   'For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if you, through the Spirit, do mortify the
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.200]   deeds of the body, you shall live.'" Yes, but you've got to do it. You do it through the Spirit.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:50.600]   It isn't done for you. The teaching is not, "Leave it to the Lord, look to him, hand it over." If you,
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:59.880]   through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. Philippians 2, same teaching
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:10.920]   exactly, in verse 12, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." Not hand it over to the
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:18.280]   Lord, work out, you and I are to work it out, our own salvation with fear and trembling. This is an
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:25.920]   exhortation to Christian people. Now this is surely most important. If not surprising, people are in
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.480]   a state of confusion. Take what we were reading this morning, in those exhortations given to
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.380]   Timothy. Didn't you notice them? A whole series, having started by telling him to be strong in the
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:45.680]   grace that is in Christ Jesus. He goes on to give him these detailed instructions, "Shun profane and
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:53.000]   vain babblings." What else does he tell him? Well, he says this, "If a man therefore purge himself
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:01.160]   from these," he's got to do it, it isn't done for him, "he's got to purge himself from these evil
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.600]   things that are in him, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and meat for the Master's use."
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:12.880]   Then listen, "Flee also youthful lusts." He doesn't say, "Look here, go through this crisis of
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:18.500]   surrender, hand yourself over to Christ and look to him, he'll fight it for you." No, what the
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:24.140]   Apostle says is this, "Take to your heels, flee also youthful lusts, make no provision for the
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:31.360]   flesh." He says again in Romans 13, "This is all an exhortation to us, flee." Everything that he
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.560]   tells us here is an exhortation to us. He's been telling this young man, Timothy, precisely the
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:44.400]   same thing in his first epistle and in chapter 6. Listen to him, "Fight the good fight of faith,"
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:52.360]   and so on. And then he goes on to give him all sorts of detailed instructions, "Therefore men of
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:19:00.240]   God flee these things, follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:09.600]   Now, here are but random selections. The epistles, as I'm reminding you, are full of this kind of
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:16.800]   thing. It comes to a man who'd been an habitual liar. What does it say to him? Does it say, "Now
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.280]   look here, my friend, don't struggle with this any longer. Don't struggle with this tendency to lie.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.840]   Hand it over to the Lord, he'll take it out of you, he'll do it for you. All you've got to do is to
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.680]   look to him and to abide him." No, what the Apostle tells this man is that he mustn't lie any longer,
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:40.600]   he mustn't do this. He adds a number of details. Here's a man who's been troubled by stealing,
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:46.040]   tendency to theft, it seems to be in him and a part of him. What's he to do? Hand it? No, no,
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:51.920]   let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.240]   is good. This is actually out of the epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 4. "Then let no corrupt
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.160]   communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is to the good of Eddie fine." You don't hand
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.040]   it over, you've got to control yourself, you've got to do this. "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.960]   Walk in love as Christ also hath loved us, but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness,
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.440]   let it not be once named among you as you become as saints, neither filthiness nor foolish talking,
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.560]   nor jesting." You are not asked to hand it over, but you're asked to stop doing it. They're not
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:30.880]   convenient, rather begin to give thanks. Now there are detailed instructions, but perhaps I can put
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:40.600]   this best of all by putting it like this. This teaching to which I'm referring not only makes
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:48.800]   these exhortations unnecessary and indeed wrong, but this is particularly true of what I may call
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:59.040]   the military metaphors and similes that are used by the Apostles in order to make us do the thing
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.720]   that they're urging us to do. Have you noticed the frequency with which they use these military
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:13.240]   images? We've got it in the text that's before us. The Apostle talks here about our standing,
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:19.640]   and withstanding. He says here, "Put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:27.200]   against the wiles of the devil." Then he uses this term "wrestling." It's a military term. We wrestle
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.560]   not against flesh and blood. You see, you and I have got to do the wrestling, and we're involved
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.720]   in this struggle. Not a word of handing it over, but we are involved in this, and he's telling us
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.040]   how we can be helped in this wrestling that you and I have got to do. Again, he uses the word
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:47.120]   "withstand." But listen to some other typical examples of this. In 1 Corinthians 16, 13,
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:55.320]   "Watch ye, he says, be on the watch. Stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men. Be strong."
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:05.080]   That's typical New Testament exaltation. Then in 2 Corinthians 10, 3, we have, "Though we walk in
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.120]   the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.440]   through God to the pulling down of strongholds." We warfare, it's our warfare, and we have to do
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.960]   it in this particular way. We don't only do it in the flesh. Of course not. But the opposite of that
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.640]   is not to say that you do nothing at all, but that you just hand it over. That's not the opposite.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.880]   That's exactly where the error comes in. Then think of these great terms. I've already read
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:38.280]   one of them in 1 Timothy 6, "Fight the good fight of faith." Now that's the Apostle exalting Timothy.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:45.880]   Timothy's got to fight. You see, Timothy's trouble was that he very easily lost hope and lost heart,
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.000]   and became discouraged, and felt that he couldn't do it, and that he was weak, and was always writing
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.400]   letters to Paul, and asking Paul to come and to help him, leaning on Paul. This is what Paul writes
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:03.720]   back to him, "Fight the good fight of faith." "Pull yourself together," says the Apostle, "be strong.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:15.200]   Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ." That's the picture. "No man but
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:21.400]   warreth, entangleth himself to the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:29.440]   to be a soldier." Now here's the whole picture, you see. In military terms, we are the fighters,
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:35.320]   we are soldiers in the army of the living God, and we are not just handing it all over. We have
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.720]   all got our part to play, our battles to fight. It's a part of the great battle, and the exhortations
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:49.200]   come to us in this military form. But not only that. This teaching, it seems to me, is utterly
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.560]   inconsistent with what the great Apostle says about himself, and about his own life. How does
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:02.520]   he put it? Well now listen to him. In 1 Corinthians 9, 26 and 27. You see, this is a scriptural matter.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:10.680]   This has got to be argued through in terms of the scripture. Here it is. "I therefore so run," he's
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:16.080]   telling us now, of the way in which he takes part in this contest. He's using an illustration. Of a
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.960]   number of men in a race, a marathon race, if you like, in the Olympic Games. They're all running.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.520]   You see, they're doing it. They're not spectators sitting back and watching something being done
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.800]   for them. They're not like the great crowds that sit and watch somebody else running. That's not
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   the picture of Christianity. He's running in the race himself. He says, this is how he puts it,
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:44.320]   "I therefore so run, not as uncertainly, so fight I." He is now using an image of boxing. This isn't
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.480]   my interpretation. Everybody's agreed about this. He takes an illustration from the boxing ring. He
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.560]   is in the ring and he's boxing an antagonist. He's doing it. It's not being done for him. Somebody's
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.600]   not in the ring on his behalf. He's in the ring himself. "So fight I, not as one that beateth the
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:06.160]   earth." He wants to beat his men. He's hitting his men, not the earth. But he says, I don't do these
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:13.720]   things uncertainly. Well, what do I do? I keep under my body. Which being correctly translated
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:22.160]   means this, I beat myself, my body, until I'm black and blue. I beat my body. I keep under my
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:28.120]   body. He's doing it himself. And it's not an easy thing to do. There's a struggle involved here. He's
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.280]   not saying to himself, well now I've got all these problems within me in the flesh, rising up and
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.680]   tempting me and getting me down. Ah, I see there's only one thing to do. I needn't struggle against
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.840]   these things any longer. All I've got to do is to surrender. Hand them over to the Lord. Let him do
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:50.640]   it for me. Let go, let God. No, no. I keep under my body. That's how the Apostle Paul lived himself.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:59.800]   I keep under my body. Why does he do this? Keep my body and bring it into subjection. Not only
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:07.440]   keeps it under, he masters it. He keeps it under subjection. Bring it under subjection. "Lest having
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:14.280]   preached to others, I myself might be a castaway." Now that's his language about himself. But listen,
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:24.280]   we've got more. Here he puts it in Philippians 3 verse 12 and following. "Not as though I had
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:31.560]   already attained." He hasn't arrived at the end of his journey. There are certain things he's
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.640]   looking forward to that I might know him. And the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:41.560]   his sufferings. "If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection from among the dead,
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:47.440]   not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect." Well, what does he do?
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:54.560]   "I follow after." Then he goes on to say, "But this one thing I do, forgetting those things that
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:01.560]   are behind, reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark."
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:08.920]   That's his picture. He's pressing with all his might and main toward the mark for the prize of
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:15.760]   the high calling of God which is in Christ Jesus. And then he has an exhortation to us in verse 16
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.200]   of that same third chapter of Philippians. Nevertheless he says, "Whereunto we have
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:27.400]   already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing." He's telling us to do it.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.400]   That's what he did himself. He's telling them to do the same thing with him. "Look to me," he says,
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:40.360]   "I'm your leader. Follow me in this matter." Let's all be of the same mind, he says. Let us walk by
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:46.000]   the same rule, let us mind the same thing. And then look at him at the end of his life. Here
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.200]   he is facing death, writing the last letter apparently ever wrote, the second epistle to
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:58.240]   Timothy chapter 4 and verse 7. He looks back at it all and this is what he says, "I have fought a
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:05.240]   good fight." But according to this teaching he shouldn't have. He shouldn't say a thing like
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:12.800]   that. He should have said, "The Lord has given me continuous victory. I've done nothing. The Lord
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:19.560]   has sustained me, fought my battles, kept me in peace. I've just been resting in him and looking
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:26.120]   to him and all has been well." That isn't what he says. He says, "I have fought a good fight. I
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:36.360]   have finished my cause. I have kept the faith." You notice that is how the Apostle speaks about
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:43.280]   himself in all the stages of his Christian life. In other words, he lived himself the kind of life
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:49.560]   to which he exalted all these early Christians. And in each case he's calling them to fight and
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:57.520]   to battle and to press toward the mark and to exert themselves. Now there it seems to me,
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:03.440]   is something that we should consider most seriously and earnestly. But let me go on.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:17.120]   The ultimate logic of this teaching surely is this, that though it sounds very wonderful as
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:25.880]   if it's all going to be done for us, in the end it leaves it all to us. Because, you see,
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:33.680]   the crucial thing is this, is our handing it over and abiding in that position. You see,
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.600]   they're bound to say that for this reason. Here is the teaching which tells us that we let go and
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.440]   let God, you hand it over to the Lord. And then, ah yes, but you suddenly find yourself falling
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:51.280]   into sin. And you say, "How has this happened? Has the Lord let me down? I handed it all over
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:57.160]   to him. You told me that he'd fight the battles, but I failed, I've fallen into sin. Has the Lord
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:02.240]   failed? Has the Lord let me down?" Of course, they have to say at once, "No, no, you mustn't say that.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:08.280]   The Lord can never fail." Well, then you say, "Well, how have I failed?" "Ah," they say, "you
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:15.240]   didn't go on abiding in the Lord." So you see, the thing that ultimately matters is what you do. It
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:20.640]   is your abiding in him that really matters. For the moment you fail to do that or stop doing that,
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:25.840]   down you go. You're not being kept. You've got to keep yourself in the Lord. You've got to keep
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.560]   yourself in this place of abiding. It all comes back to you. You're left where you were at the
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:39.560]   beginning, which surely is the most serious matter. The New Testament doesn't leave it all to you like
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:45.040]   that. Here, then, is a teaching which is self-contradictory. Apparently takes it out of
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:51.360]   your hands, at the end leaves it all back in your hands. It entirely depends upon your maintaining
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:58.480]   this position of surrender. But furthermore, it seems to me that there is here an incipient denial
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:05.000]   of the doctrine of the new birth. I know that the friends who hold this teaching believe in the new
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.480]   birth, but they're inconsistent at this point. They don't see that in their teaching here they do deny
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:16.120]   the doctrine of the rebirth in this way. The doctrine of the rebirth is a doctrine that tells
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:23.920]   us that man in the new birth receives a new disposition. A new principle of life is put into
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:30.280]   him that was not there before. If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature. All things are passed
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:37.360]   away. Behold, all things have become new. Before conversion, a man was dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.520]   He was altogether without any strength. The Apostle has been reminding these Ephesians of
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:48.320]   that. This I say, therefore, he says in chapter 4, 17, and testify in the Lord that he henceforth
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:54.280]   walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind. He says you were once like that,
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:32:03.600]   but you're no longer in that position. He says you now, you have not so learned Christ. If so be that
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.840]   he have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Christ Jesus, that he put off
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.600]   concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to deceitful lusts,
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:17.680]   and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that he put on the new man. Now before a man
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:24.400]   becomes a Christian, he's the old man only. He's got nothing but that evil, sinful, fleshly,
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:31.640]   carnal nature. He's just one. But what does the rebirth mean? Oh, it means that there's a new man.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:37.080]   A new man has come into being, and the new man, you remember, is one who is created,
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:46.800]   who after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. He's not as he was before. There
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:53.120]   is a principle after God in him which is righteous and holy, and working in that direction. There is
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:58.680]   a new power in him. There's a new life. Now the Apostle says exactly the same thing in the next
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:06.560]   chapter, chapter 5, verse 8. He says, "You were sometimes darkness, but you are now light in the
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:14.400]   Lord. Walk therefore as children of light." You see, here is a fundamental bit of teaching,
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:23.360]   but according to the other teaching, we remain always the same, and there's no strength,
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.480]   there's no goodness at all, and all we've got to do is to rely on the Lord. Do you remember
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.080]   the famous illustration that is used? It's about a poker. There you look at a poker. What you see
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:45.280]   about it? Well, it's black. It is also rigid. There it is. Well now, you put that poker into
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:53.160]   the fire. What happens to it? Well, it becomes hot, whereas it was cold. It becomes red,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.720]   whereas it was black. It becomes malleable. You can bend it, whereas it was formerly rigid. Yes,
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.760]   but only as long as it's in the fire. Take it out of the fire, says the illustration,
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:11.160]   and it reverts to its former condition of being cold and black and rigid. Now that to me is a
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:15.960]   denial of the doctrine of the rebirth. That is not true of the Christian. The Christian is a
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.560]   man who has a principle of new life in him, and there is power in that life, because it is a
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:26.160]   principle of righteousness and of true holiness. Not only that, it is something which can grow. It
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.680]   is something which can develop, but the other teaching doesn't allow for that. Take it out of
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:35.680]   the fire, it goes back exactly to where it was before. The same with the illustration about the
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:41.280]   wings that you put on, or the life belt to keep you up in the water. As long as you're wearing
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.520]   the wings, you'll go on floating. Get out of the wings, down you'll sink to the bottom. Now,
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:52.400]   there is no point left there at all, nor place for growth, nor development, nor advance. Whereas in
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:58.160]   the scripture, owing to the doctrine of the new birth, we obviously grow. We are born as babes
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.960]   in Christ. We are infants in Christ. We become little children. We become young men. We become
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.720]   old men. Grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord. Obviously, there's new life here,
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:15.000]   and life is something which grows. And I mustn't be told about myself that I'm so utterly hopeless,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.680]   there's nothing for me to do but to rely upon the Lord and his strength. Not at all, as I'm hoping
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.600]   to show you. What the strength of the Lord does is to feed and to develop this new life that is in
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:31.480]   me, and to make it stronger and stronger. So it seems to me at that point, though our friends,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:37.080]   I say, would claim to believe and do most certainly believe in the doctrine of regeneration, in this
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:42.320]   particular aspect of their teaching, they are virtually denying it. But wait a minute. This,
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.240]   it seems to me, this teaching is entirely unlike the whole of biblical teaching. It's passive. And
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:55.320]   biblical teaching is not passive. I've given you examples to prove it's always very active. You
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:00.800]   wouldn't have exhortations if it was a teaching of passivity, but the Bible is full of exhortations
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:07.240]   and appeals and arguments and demonstrations and reasonings. Why, as I've often pointed out,
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.760]   these New Testament epistles would never have been necessary at all if this other teaching
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.000]   is right. All the apostles would have to say is this. Now then, you've been converted,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.800]   you've been saved, that's step number one. There's only one other thing for you to do.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:25.000]   Hand it all over to the Lord. He'll keep you, he'll do everything you need. Don't you do anything?
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.080]   Hand it over to the Lord. Let go, let God. The New Testament epistles, with all these involved
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:35.560]   arguments and disputations and reasonings and pointing out of error and exalting past,
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:40.440]   would be entirely unnecessary. There'd only be one thing to say. And of course, that is what our
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.120]   friends do say. You've been converted, very well, go to the next place, you'll get this other place,
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:51.600]   that's all you need. Quite simple. But according to the Bible, it is not quite simple. These
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:58.280]   epistles are not quite simple. And they're not quite simple because life isn't simple. Because
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:04.840]   the devil isn't simple. And because the Christian life is not simple. My dear friends, this teaching
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:11.080]   is too passive and not only that, it's too mechanical. It's much too mechanical. There's
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:16.560]   nothing mechanical here. This deals with life and growth and food and energy. The others,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.480]   what? Just hand over, leave it, that's all, and stay there. No, no, that's mechanics,
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:28.560]   that's not life. But I say the chief objection to it is that it's a shortcut. And there's never a
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:35.360]   shortcut in the spiritual life. That's the characteristic always of the cults. All the
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.760]   cults which are attracting so many people today, that's their secret. They say it's quite simple.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.360]   These preachers, they take you through these epistles and all this theology and doctrine
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.680]   and argument and difficulty. Don't listen to them, they say. It's quite simple. Just believe this,
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.280]   all is well. No matter how you come into the meeting, you can go out, you'll have no problems,
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.720]   no troubles. You'll walk with a light step, you'll be walking on air. All is quite simple.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:05.320]   That's the cults. That's never the scripture. And of course another characteristic is this.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.560]   You'll find it in all the cults. Most of them started in the last century, the 19th century.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:18.060]   So did this particular teaching we're looking at. And they all say the same thing. They say,
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:24.680]   what a tragedy that for all these centuries people missed this. Look at the saints,
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:31.440]   you read their lives. Look at them fasting. Look at them sweating. Look at them agonizing
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:37.400]   in prayer. What a tragedy, they say. What a pity that they hadn't realized this essentially
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:43.040]   simple teaching. Now I'm not saying this, that is what they say. You can read their books. Read
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:48.680]   Mrs. Pearsall Smith and the Christian Secret of a Happy Life. You'll find she says it. Read a book
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:53.840]   called So Great Salvation. You'll find it says it. It says, isn't it extraordinary that throughout
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:39:01.360]   all those centuries people missed this. They at last discovered it. Last century. It had never
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:07.040]   been known before. Suddenly the simple solution has been found. All the cults say exactly that.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:13.760]   And I would have argued that that in and of itself is sufficient to prove that it is wrong.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:24.200]   That all the patriarchs and all the Protestant reformers, all the mighty men of God who knew
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.360]   God in such an intimate manner and who did such exploits for him and whom he used so mightily,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.840]   we are asked to believe that they all had missed the crucial teaching. They all have gone the wrong
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:39.320]   way. They've misunderstood the scriptures. My friends, that in and of itself is enough to put
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:46.040]   this teaching right out. There is an arrogance attached to it, which in itself proclaims that
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:51.120]   it is not a true exposition of scripture. I'm speaking strongly because I'm dealing with a
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:56.600]   claim that the teaching makes for itself. In other words, I conclude by putting it like this.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:02.800]   The final argument that people generally bring at this point is this. They say, yes,
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:09.200]   you say what you like, you know, but it works. It works. There was I for all those years
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:14.680]   struggling. I met this teaching. I believed it. I immediately got release. It works. It does it.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:21.120]   What do you say to that? What I say to that, of course, is this, that that is precisely what all
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:28.040]   the devotees of the cults say. How do you explain it, says someone? There's no difficulty at all.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:38.840]   All these cults and psychological teachings can produce results. Obviously, they wouldn't succeed
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:44.480]   for a day if they couldn't. You don't think people would rush after them and buy their books if they
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:50.120]   didn't do anything at all? Of course they can. We are very strange creatures. We can persuade
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:56.080]   ourselves of many things. There are many ways of getting temporary relief and release. Christian
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.960]   science does make many people feel very happy. That doesn't prove that Christian science is true,
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:08.000]   does it? You don't test the teaching by results only. You test every teaching by the scriptures.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.760]   If you are going to fall back on the argument, it works, it's done this for me, well then I ask you,
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.200]   what argument have you got to give to the devotees of the cults this morning? You've got no answer at
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:23.280]   all. They can repeat everything you say. They can say, you know, I used to be a terrible warrior.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.960]   Everything was a burden to me. I could never get rid of it. I couldn't sleep at night. Fortunately,
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.840]   one day a friend said to me, come to this Christian science meeting with me. I went in,
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:37.640]   full of troubles, anxieties, scares. I came out, they'd all gone. I've never had a worry ever since.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:43.640]   Oh, they say that, and they're speaking the truth. Yes, but you see, the question is,
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:52.680]   how has it been done? The test is never the test of results only. The primary test that
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:59.200]   always should be applied to any teaching is the test that we've been applying together this
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:07.640]   morning. It is the test of the scriptures. What saith the word of God? My desire should not
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.680]   primarily to be happy. It should be to be holy. It should be to conform to the scriptures. It
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:19.840]   should be to do what God calls upon me and tells me to do. My dear friends, there is no shortcut in
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:25.520]   this Christian life. You can reject at sight any teaching that tells you it's quite simple. It is
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:34.080]   not quite simple. We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:39.000]   powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.760]   high places. What about it? Well, you need to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:49.200]   You need to put on the whole armor of God and attend to each part and portion, and go on fighting.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:56.160]   So that you at the end of your life with the great apostle will be able to say, "I have fought the
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:07.360]   good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Henceforward there is laid up for me a
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:15.280]   crown of righteousness, a victor's crown." Yes, the New Testament talks about things like that.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:20.680]   It is you and I who have to do the fighting. Now then, we've been negative this morning. I have to
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.880]   be negative. There are so many people who won't listen to any other teaching because they believe
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:30.640]   the teaching that I've been trying to hold before you. We have to get rid of it. And then we shall
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:38.800]   find the scriptures' own teaching, the positive teaching, which shows us how you and I are to
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:49.840]   fight and to wrestle, and how we are enabled to do so. It isn't done for us. We are enabled to do
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:57.240]   it ourselves. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. God willing, we'll go on to
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:02.880]   look at it in a positive manner next Sunday morning. Now shall we join in singing our closing
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:12.520]   hymn, which is hymn number 506? 506. "Oft in danger, oft in woe, onward Christians, onward go;
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:20.160]   bear the toil, maintain the strife, strengthened with the bread of life." 506.

[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:36.160]   And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless before
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:45.160]   the presence of his glory, with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:55.160]   majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. And may grace, mercy and peace from God the Father,
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:02.160]   God the Son and God the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:11.160]   of this our short uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until the great and final day of
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.160]   victory shall come. Amen.
