[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today, Friday, July 11, 2014.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.200]   Today's show is going to be a question and answer show.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.000]   And today we're going to talk about how do you protect yourself in a bear market?
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.600]   We're going to talk again about what financial advice would you like to have at 18 years old?
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.000]   What would be the best investment strategy for a young couple looking to buy a house in the next three to five years?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.900]   And what's the most complicated thing in my day?
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.000]   And then my thoughts on the book, The Millionaire Fast Lane.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Stay with us. So I've been looking forward to today's show.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.700]   This is fun. I like doing Q&A. And as we start to get some good traction online
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.900]   and we start to get some more people more and more more of more of you listening,
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.600]   which I really appreciate and I thank you for those of you who are listening.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.700]   I am excited about doing these Q&A shows because to me, you know, I can sit back and I do sit back and try to think,
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.200]   well, what are the things that I think are the most relevant or the most useful for people to know and understand?
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.900]   But really, it helps me a lot if you just simply tell me.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.500]   Tell me what you want to know and what you want to understand.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.600]   And so this past week, we've been engaged, I've been engaging with you guys on Twitter and asking for your questions,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.100]   which, by the way, if you'd like to follow us on Twitter, the Twitter handle for the show is Radical PF.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.100]   So just go on Twitter and search Radical PF and you will find us.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.400]   And I'd love to engage with you there and I'd love to have a conversation, help out any way that I can.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.800]   And so we're going to cover these, was that four questions, five questions that I received from the audience.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.000]   I'm going to recover, but very briefly this time, one of the questions that I did the whole show on on Wednesday
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.500]   because I got some additional ideas and I'd like to do a little bit better job with it.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.300]   So we're going to be covering those questions and then I hope to make this a regular Friday event
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.500]   where basically on Fridays I answer your questions and I do my best to be specific and direct
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.000]   and give you some ways, some things to think about.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.500]   And my biggest frustration back when I was a practicing financial advisor is that it always frustrates me
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   that it seems like people don't go to professionals for financial advice.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.700]   Now, I understand there's a lot of distrust of financial advisors.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.500]   If you actually look at the statistics and the industry statistics,
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.400]   it's seen that financial advisors have a lower trust rating than do car dealers, used car dealers.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.000]   And, you know, I always feel I always felt bad for car dealers because,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.300]   well, actually I could always empathize with car dealers because it seems like, you know,
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.300]   they're the brunt of a lot of jokes.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.000]   But yet, you know, I was a life insurance salesperson and that's the brunt of a lot of jokes.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.500]   And a financial advisor, you're the brunt of a lot of jokes there.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.000]   So it's good.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.500]   Those jokes are probably good though because hopefully they keep us honest
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.000]   and they keep our industry honest and they keep us getting better each and every day trying to improve our reputation.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.400]   Now, obviously there's a lot of people that deserve that bad reputation
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.800]   and there are a few of us that really try to develop a good reputation.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.200]   So what I'd like to do is I'd like to give you access to me.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.400]   You know, I'm a certified financial planner.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.300]   I've got a bunch of technical knowledge.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.700]   Hopefully you start to like some of the ways that I think about things and the ways that I talk about things.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.600]   And the reason that I'd like to provide this as a service is because people don't take me up on it.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.700]   I always used to joke with my clients and I'd say, listen, anytime, not joke,
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.400]   I used to tell my clients anytime you ever have a financial decision, call me and just talk to me about it.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   I'm here. I'm not going to charge you for the phone call.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.300]   Just call me and talk to me about it because what I see over and over,
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.400]   and this is the joke, is that usually people ask the wrong people for advice.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.600]   The example that I always go to is, let's say that you take on a new job and you're sitting there
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   and human resources comes in with this giant stack of papers and they toss it on the desk and it goes right on the desk.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.300]   And there is a big, big stack of papers there and you pick it up and you kind of scratch your head and say,
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.700]   I don't understand these words. So usually, here's what most people do.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.100]   They kind of lean back in the chair and they ask the broke guy next to them and they say,
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.700]   hey, Joe, you know, listen, what did you put down on these papers?
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.100]   And I'm saying, why on earth are you asking the broke guy in the cubicle next to you for financial advice?
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.300]   Pick up the phone and call a financial advisor. And even if that person charges you,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.900]   let's say they charge you 50 bucks for a 20 minute conversation.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.900]   That would probably be a better idea than asking the broke guy in the cubicle next to you.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.700]   But the problem is, people aren't accustomed to calling financial advisors.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.500]   They're not accustomed to talking with financial planners.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.900]   And so what I'd like to do is give you access to just mainly how a financial planner would think,
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.300]   which is how I'm going to handle these shows. Now, unfortunately, there's this little problem.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.300]   There's a little problem that in the United States, giving financial advice is heavily regulated and probably rightly so.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.000]   So what that means is I can never give personal financial advice.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.100]   That's a reason for the disclaimers at the end of the show.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.100]   I can't tell you what you should do, but I actually don't think that's the most important thing.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.200]   Number one, I can't know who you are and what you are looking for in a Twitter comment.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.100]   So I can't in 140 characters figure out what what your life story is.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:19.300]   But my hope is that is to send you back to and at cause you and encourage you to go and find somebody that you can trust
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.900]   and go and find your individual financial planner, your advisor, your most trusted financial person,
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.400]   whoever that is, whether that's an accountant, an attorney, a trusted friend or business associate,
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.500]   an insurance agent, a financial advisor, whatever that is.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.100]   I want to encourage you to go back to that person because that's the person who can really understand what you are,
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.400]   what you are, what your situation is.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.300]   But what I believe I can do and what I want to do with these questions is tell you how I would think about it.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.700]   Is talk to you about some of the different ways that I would approach the problem.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:00.500]   And if I can successfully do that and give you some ideas on how I would approach the problems,
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   then my hope is it will kind of stir up your creative juices.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.300]   And then if you are a do-it-yourselfer, all the information is out there for free.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.700]   Go down to the library, go online, be careful online because it's a lot easier for somebody
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.900]   to write a forum post and you think it's really good.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.000]   In reality, it's not.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.400]   Generally, you don't have a lot of posers writing in-depth technical financial planning textbooks.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   So you might be better off going down to the library and reading some books
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.300]   where there's a higher investment on behalf of the author than just going based upon a forum post.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.000]   But still, if you're a do-it-yourselfer, fine.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.700]   Hopefully this information will give you help.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:40.500]   If not, hopefully it will give you some encouragement and motivation to seek out an advisor that you trust
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.100]   and have a conversation with them and see if they'll be able to help you out.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.300]   I really hope they could.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.400]   This is one of my, I guess it's not secret, but this is part of my agenda for the show,
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.500]   is that I always never understood why don't people talk to financial advisors more.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.800]   I used to think, "I'm a good guy."
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.200]   And I understand the distress.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.800]   I've talked with lots of people about it.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.000]   But hopefully we'll help a little bit and hopefully we'll arm you with information
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.900]   so that you can smoke the good ones out from the bad ones and you can understand
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.300]   and you can be a better educated consumer.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.700]   I hope this helps you.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.400]   So, a couple of quick announcements before we get going.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.300]   First of all, I did get some of my technology issues worked out,
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.100]   so I am able to do some interviews.
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.300]   So hopefully you enjoyed the interview yesterday on not paying your taxes
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.600]   because of as a war tax resistance movement.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.300]   I certainly did.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.700]   It's a subject that I've never heard discussed on a financial show.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.400]   And my advice is still going to be to pay your taxes because that's the proper advice.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.100]   However, I would encourage you to kind of research and consider what your conscience would say.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:48.000]   And I would admire you if you decided that you needed to follow in the path of David Gross,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.800]   who we talked to yesterday.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.900]   I have, it's a thought-provoking topic.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.300]   And I enjoyed the interview.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.200]   I'd love to talk to other people that are in that world as well.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   Because again, I often in the past would say, "Well, these people are crazy."
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.400]   But I tell you, David sure isn't crazy.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.700]   Or he sure didn't sound crazy.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.500]   And when you read his thoughts and you read,
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.800]   and especially if you read his book and see the research,
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.100]   I had no idea about the history of tax resistance
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.300]   and the impact that it's made in places where it really was needed and had a big impact.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.300]   So this next week, I've got two interviews lined up.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.100]   I'm going to be interviewing Jake DeSilis from the show,
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.700]   the podcast and website called The Voluntary Life.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.600]   I've enjoyed Jake's podcast for a couple of years.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.400]   And he's just a really neat guy.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.700]   He's from the UK.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.500]   He's an entrepreneur.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.300]   He's just written a book on entrepreneurship.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.200]   And I haven't read that book yet.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.100]   I plan to read it over the weekend here before I speak with him
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.500]   to try to be able to do a better interview with him.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.500]   But I have certainly enjoyed his content.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.900]   And he's very soft-spoken.
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.900]   He's very gentle on his podcast.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.900]   And I would commend his podcast to you.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.700]   And if you're interested in some of these topics of financial literacy
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:05.400]   and financial philosophy as it interacts with things like political philosophy,
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.200]   then I encourage you to check out his show, The Voluntary Life.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.400]   If you have questions, if you've listened to his show
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.200]   or you have questions for him after maybe reviewing his content over the weekend,
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   let me know those questions either on Twitter or via email.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.400]   And I will be interviewing him next week.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.900]   Also going to be interviewing Jacob Lund Fisker from the Early Retirement Extreme.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.200]   I reviewed Jacob's book, Early Retirement Extreme, and I love that book.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.400]   And I highly commend it to you.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.200]   I did a lengthy book review where I wound up just reading more from the book
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.800]   and saying it's awesome a lot rather than actually any keen and cutting insight.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.500]   But I really enjoyed Jacob's book.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.900]   And so I would encourage you, if you have questions for Jacob,
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.200]   he is not so much in the public eye these days,
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.900]   but I think I've sweet-talked him into doing an interview with me.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.200]   I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.300]   So if you have questions that you would like me to ask him,
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.500]   please ask me those questions as well.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.200]   And I'll make sure to include them if I'm able to on Twitter.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.700]   Again, ask me on Twitter or send me an email at joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.700]   joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com or on Twitter @radicalpf.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.700]   Also, just a reminder, if you're enjoying the content,
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.200]   come by the blog and sign up for the email list.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.600]   I don't-- just a quick note on the email list,
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.500]   and I'm sure I'll repeat this throughout the course of the show.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.700]   The email list is designed to give you information on what the show is about,
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.400]   so you can decide whether to listen.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.700]   I'm releasing a lot of content.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.100]   I'd be surprised if you're able to keep up with it each and every day.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.900]   I hope you do. That would be awesome.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.900]   But I think selective listening is fine.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.100]   So the best way to keep tabs on the content of the show
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.400]   is sign up for the email list, and with that-- and sign up there.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.100]   And each day, I'll send you the full show notes.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.500]   It'll pop up right in your email when the show is published,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.100]   so you'll be able to look at it and see if it's a topic that you're interested in.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.500]   And so please consider doing that.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.700]   That'll help you to be able to curate your content a little bit
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.300]   to see what you're interested in and not.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   And then on Wednesday next week,
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.500]   I'm planning to do an in-depth show
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.900]   on some of the fundamentals of stocks and bonds,
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.100]   trying to continue with the teaching shows,
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.400]   and talk through some of the fundamentals
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.500]   to give you a way to think about it when you hear the word "stocks,"
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.100]   to give you a way to think about what that means.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.100]   Right now, in today's show, we're going to be talking--
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.600]   the first question I'm going to look at is,
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.300]   "What steps would you take to protect your investments in a bear market?"
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.700]   And I'm going to give a detailed answer to that question,
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.500]   but I may be throwing terminology at you you're not familiar with.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.300]   It's all going to build over time,
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.800]   and it's going to build starting with a proper understanding
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.700]   of what are stocks and bonds.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.700]   So look for that on Wednesday,
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.500]   and then look for the Q&A show next Friday.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.200]   Hopefully, I'll get these interviews run on Tuesday and Thursday.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   And then Monday, I haven't decided the content yet.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.000]   I may do another teaching show,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.100]   or I may do something else,
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.600]   talk about current events or something like that.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.600]   We'll see. So we'll see how that goes.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.900]   So, first question here.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.700]   This comes from-- this one came in on Twitter.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.400]   And the question is a good one.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.800]   The Twitter handle here is @MotoJones.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.100]   And so, Moto, thank you for the question.
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.900]   And the question here is,
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.600]   "What steps would you take to protect your investments in a bear market,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.200]   and when would you put them in place?"
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.000]   And so, I'm going to answer this specifically,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.100]   but it's going to be a big answer.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.200]   And there are a few--
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.000]   there are a few ways to answer the question.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.100]   And, Moto, I apologize to you in advance.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.700]   It's not a simple answer.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.600]   It is one of the most complicated questions that you could possibly answer.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.700]   So, my short answer to the question is--
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.000]   has three parts.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.800]   What step would I take to protect my investment in a bear market?
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.000]   I would-- so the first answer is,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.700]   I would take whatever steps my strategy indicated that I should take
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.000]   to protect my investments in a bear market.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.400]   The second answer is, nothing.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.300]   I wouldn't take any steps to protect my investments in a bear market.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.900]   And the third answer, as far as when I would put them in place,
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.500]   I would put them in place before investing any money.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.100]   And so, let me give you the answer,
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.600]   and let me expand on those things so they just don't sound like crazy talk.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.800]   And I tried to touch on this this last week
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   when talking about markets and the reaction to--
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.100]   on Monday's show, when talking about Dow 17,000.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.200]   And when I came away from that show,
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   I realized I really struggled to communicate this clearly.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.900]   But the point that I was trying to get across
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.200]   was that there's no one strategy that works.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.100]   And actually figuring out, you know,
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.000]   what should you do when the bear market comes,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.600]   which I understand you're asking it in advance,
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.400]   but what most people say is, "Well, what should I do?
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.700]   I think there's a bear market. What should I do?"
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.800]   And you've got to understand your strategy
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   long before the bear market ever comes.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.600]   It's completely the wrong question to ask.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.000]   And you need to incorporate into your strategy,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.900]   "What are you going to do in a bear market?"
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.300]   And, you know, markets are--
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.000]   seem at times incredibly logical and rational
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.900]   and seem, the rest of the time, you know, completely schizophrenic.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.100]   I can't remember, Ben Graham had a cute saying on it.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.600]   It was something about-- I forget his quote,
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.000]   but, you know, the market is crazy.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.200]   One day it's totally sane and the next day it's totally rational.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.500]   I should look up that quote and memorize it.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.100]   But the only way to survive in a bear market or a bull market
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.800]   is to understand your strategy and know what you're going to do.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.700]   And so there are very few strategies that I know of
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.100]   that should be changed in a bear market.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.500]   Now, you do have to have a strategy for the bear market,
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.200]   but there are very few strategies that should be changed
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.600]   when you're in a bear market.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.100]   And here's where you've got to understand
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.900]   what your actual investment strategy is
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.200]   and all of the research and the history and the planning behind it.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.800]   And so, first, when you study markets and you study--
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.300]   you get a little bit more sophisticated
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.400]   and you start looking at portfolio management.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.400]   And my caveat, I am not a portfolio manager.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.700]   I'm not that interested in-- I'm interested in studying it.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.100]   I'm not interested in doing it.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.400]   I'd love to have some great portfolio managers on it sometime,
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.500]   but I know enough to really admire it
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.500]   and to understand kind of the theory behind it.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.200]   But the actual practicing of it, it's not my deal.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   But the key is you can make tons of money in a bear market.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.500]   Tons of money in a bear market.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.700]   You can make just as much money in a bear market
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.300]   as you can in a bull market.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.000]   And maybe you can make more.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.200]   And you can lose your shirt in a bear market and in a bull market.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.300]   It's not these phrases, "What is a bear market?"
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.400]   or "What is a bull market?"
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.300]   In general, people think a bear market is a simple thing.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.000]   And it is.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.800]   So the way it's reported in the press is that,
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.800]   "Well, we're in a bear market."
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.700]   So what that means, basically,
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.500]   is that the prices of stocks measured in aggregate, in general,
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.100]   are going down in a nominal basis.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.200]   So the actual price, not in a relative basis,
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.300]   but in a nominal basis, is going down over time,
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.800]   over an extended period of time.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.300]   Now, there are more specific definitions,
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.100]   but that's my working definition for today.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.500]   So bear market, stocks going down over time.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.100]   But the thing is that you've got to realize
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.800]   that's only one part of the story.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.200]   That is an aggregate observation that goes well
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.400]   when you're talking about a big picture idea,
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.900]   stock prices declining.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:05.200]   But it tells nothing about the success of the individual investor.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.600]   And so we'll talk about kind of what are some of the different ways
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.800]   that success could be managed,
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.400]   and what are the different strategies,
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.600]   and how would those different strategies adjust in a bear market.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.000]   So first of all, let's go with how most people think about portfolio management.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.800]   I'll call this just simple, straightforward portfolio management.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.500]   And the point I tried to make on Monday, ineffectively,
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.900]   was that most people are using not individual stocks,
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.500]   but most people are using some type of managed investment,
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:39.300]   be that a mutual fund, be that a set of sub-accounts within a variable annuity,
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.100]   or a set of sub-accounts within a variable life insurance policy,
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.400]   or an exchange-traded fund, or something like that.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.000]   They're using some kind of managed investment.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.900]   So in managed investments, from the simpler versions,
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:57.400]   you've got fairly straightforward management styles going on.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.300]   So let's talk about stock mutual funds.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.300]   So we're going to be specific.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.700]   I'm going to ignore the management of bond mutual funds.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.900]   Let's just talk specifically about the management of stock mutual funds.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.500]   And let's talk about active funds, and let's talk about passive funds.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.100]   So if you pay any attention to financial press,
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:18.500]   then one of the things that is basically accepted as gospel among the online--
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.700]   I should come up with a name for this--
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:25.400]   the online financial gurus, or financial literati--
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.100]   oh, I'll coin something one of these days.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.300]   But in the online world, it's basically accepted as gospel
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.500]   that the only approach to investing that works, and that's the best,
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.300]   and that's the best thing that everyone should do with their money,
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.000]   is to use passive index funds as the basis for your investments.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   And I don't agree.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.700]   I don't disagree.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.500]   I'm not going to comment on that today.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.300]   But let's just start with passive investing.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.300]   So passive index investing.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   So the fundamental premise behind passive index investing
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.900]   is this is built on the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.300]   This is built on the idea that markets are absolutely efficient,
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.900]   and that it's impossible for you to find any way
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.700]   to do better than another person based upon research.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.800]   And even if it is possible to find a little bit,
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.500]   it's not possible for you to do it for less cost.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.300]   So most people who are really involved in passive investing
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.200]   and in the concept of indexing would say, well, we wouldn't necessarily--
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:20.800]   many people.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.900]   I should steer away from most, because I have absolutely no statistics
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.600]   to back this up.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.200]   It's just an oppression that I've gotten from research.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.600]   So many people would say, well, we wouldn't necessarily
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:38.500]   say that an active manager can't outperform a passive portfolio.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:43.200]   But we would say that an active manager can't outperform a passive portfolio
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.400]   and cover the costs.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.900]   So we'll just strip out all the costs of the active manager,
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.800]   and we'll do good enough.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.000]   And we'll just take the average return of the market,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.700]   and we'll try to just own the market.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.400]   All right.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.600]   So this strategy, it works.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.200]   I don't see any reason why it can't work, why it won't work,
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   why it doesn't work.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   Most of the academic literature would say that this works.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.800]   But the key here is that the premise is that the market is always right.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   And so if you have a bull market, the market is right.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.700]   And if you have a bear market, the market is right.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.500]   And so the key is you've got to stick with the market.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.900]   And you've got to be committed under this strategy
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.000]   to never adjusting based upon the bulls or the bears.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.400]   Now, we'll talk in a moment about derivatives.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.600]   So you could say, well, I'm going to use something
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.800]   like an exchange-traded fund.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   I'm going to make my own bet on the market.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   So if this were your strategy and this were your trading strategy,
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:44.200]   then you could say, I'm going to use an ETF, a total market ETF.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.300]   And I'm going to short that because I think the market is going to go down.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.200]   And that's your trade.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   But that's not passive investing.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.800]   So we'll get to trading in a moment.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.600]   But passive investing, you just simply accept the market is right.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.600]   The market is the consensus--
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.200]   the market price of stocks, of these companies that we're trading,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.000]   is the consensus of all of the people involved.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.300]   And they are correct.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.200]   So therefore, if the market price is down, the market price is down,
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.100]   that gives me an opportunity to buy more.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.100]   The market price is up.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.200]   That's great because the money is going up.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.900]   But I'm just going to simply go on faith that this is always the correct price.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.300]   And I'm going to put my money in over time.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.700]   And I'm going to depend on economic growth to drive my returns.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.300]   So the economic growth of the companies-- because I know if the managers of the
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.100]   companies can't produce economic growth, the board of directors will fire them.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.300]   And they will hire a new set of managers.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.900]   That's the philosophy behind passive investing.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.700]   So if that is your philosophy, there's no room in that philosophy or in that
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:46.400]   trading strategy for saying, I'm going to get out because there's a bear market.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.000]   But yet, many people do.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.200]   So they say, well, I know where the bear market is.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.700]   Problem is that you probably can't know.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.600]   But being right when a bear market is coming requires you to be right twice.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.000]   You've got to be right going down.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   So you've got to say, OK, the market's going to go down, and I'm going to get out.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.400]   And then you've got to be right going in again, as far as when to get in again.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:12.200]   And it is incredibly difficult to be right twice because there's so many factors at play.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.900]   Now, at the end of the day, that's your prerogative.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.200]   If you want to trade your portfolio like that, that's totally fine.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.600]   If you think you can be right-- I've had those ideas myself.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   I've had those hunches.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.500]   But if you think that you can, that's fine.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.600]   But recognize that it requires you to be right twice.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.800]   And this is the big one that I've observed in the financial press over the last, what,
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.600]   five years since 2008, six years since 2008.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.900]   Many people would say, well, look, I'm right on getting out.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.600]   Look, I see the decline coming.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.700]   But when did you tell people to get back in?
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.400]   Because in one way, it's really easy to see bad news.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.900]   In other ways, it's really easy to not know when-- it's really tough to know, OK, the
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.800]   bad news is over and I'm ready to get back in.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.900]   And so I just leave that for you to think about.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.200]   You consider what you want to do.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.900]   There are various strategies where the people will say, listen, I know this and I can do
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.900]   this.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:04.060]   But this idea that I'm just going to own an index fund in my 401(k) and every-- in one
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.260]   month I'm going to get in and 11 months I'm going to get out, I've never seen any proven
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.240]   research to show that that would be correct.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.600]   So that would be passive investing.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.700]   And that's how to answer the question is, if you understand the strategy, unless your
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.700]   strategy incorporates a trading strategy or an insurance strategy, which we're going to
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.900]   go to in a moment, then in general, you just got to commit to yourself, I'm going to sit
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.140]   tight and I'm going to enjoy the ride.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.180]   And I'm going to do something else, which we'll talk about that something else in a
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.380]   moment as how to protect yourself because this is where the real key is.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:38.420]   We're going to do something else to make sure that I'm protected in the mutual fund.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.600]   And that's something else just to whet your appetite.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.020]   That something else is financial planning, not portfolio management, meaning that you're
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:51.900]   not going to be relying on these assets in a time of a bear-- in a time of a bear market.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.500]   So number two, let's go on to active funds.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.380]   So in an active mutual fund strategy, and let's stick for a moment with stock mutual
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.380]   funds.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.900]   In an active mutual fund strategy, here you have a portfolio manager, which is actually
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:09.740]   a large team of managers working together, although there is one person who is in charge
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.340]   and has the full responsibility for the portfolio.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.340]   And this team would be a team of researchers, a team of traders, a team of strategists,
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.800]   and the manager is bringing it all together.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.780]   So these funds could work, but if you own these funds, you're not going to be adjusting
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.500]   in a bear market, or at least you shouldn't be adjusting in a bear market because you
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.060]   are choosing a philosophy and you're going in and you're buying those funds.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.700]   So read your prospectus and understand what is my manager doing for me?
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.340]   Why am I paying him the $15 million a year that he's earning?
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.020]   Why am I actually doing this?
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.420]   And understand it.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.500]   And don't-- you don't make the change because of the bear market.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:54.060]   So this is like, if you're telling your manager, "Okay, manager, I want you to be looking for
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.620]   value stocks."
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.340]   And let's say that you're using a value fund.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.820]   And so on this-- in this type of strategy, you're using a value stock fund.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:10.140]   Your manager has the charge to go out and shop for bargains, looking for companies that
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.460]   have low-- lower multiples and high dividend yields.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.300]   And so they're out trying to find bargains.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.740]   And they're trying to say, "I think that this company's stock price is down because of this--
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.400]   these factors that are going out.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.180]   And I think they're going to rebound, either because the economic environment is going
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.820]   to get better, because we've got new management, or because we've got new products, or things
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.820]   like that."
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:38.300]   And so these managers are going out and trying to find companies that they can buy at a value.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:43.180]   Well, when are they likely-- the most likely to find companies that they can buy at a value?
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.980]   In a bad market, right?
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.740]   In a declining price market, which is what a bear market is.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.820]   So if all of a sudden you are-- you're pulling your money out of an active mutual fund, and
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:57.380]   you're owning value stock mutual funds within that portfolio, and you're pulling your money
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.700]   out, what does the manager have to do?
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:05.060]   They have to sell investments to raise cash so that you can redeem your shares in the
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.060]   mutual fund.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.060]   That's what happens.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.060]   That's how it's done.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:12.260]   When you buy an investment in a mutual fund, that cash flows into the mutual fund manager's
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.480]   portfolio.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.000]   The manager then uses that cash to buy investments.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.900]   When you redeem shares in a mutual fund, then the mutual fund manager has to sell investments,
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.580]   raise the cash to pay you your redemption fees.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:29.260]   And this is one of the downsides of mutual funds, is that you have these times of euphoria
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.700]   and depression in the market swings.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.220]   And so this really causes mutual fund portfolio managers a real challenge, because they've
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:42.420]   got to keep enough cash on hand to-- they've got to keep enough cash on hand to allow you
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.740]   to redeem your shares when you sell your investments.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.780]   So this is a real challenge if you're managing a portfolio.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.540]   You've got to figure out, how much cash do I keep around?
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:56.300]   And maybe your best investment ideas aren't going to pay off for a year, because you see
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.780]   the company, but you've got to all of a sudden, because the prices are going down, you've
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.660]   got to all of a sudden sell the portfolio out.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.980]   So if you're using actively managed mutual funds, you've got to be committed to staying
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.060]   the course.
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:14.700]   When I was managing-- well, technically it's called managing investment portfolios, but
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.460]   I always called it managing investor behavior.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:22.340]   And that my job was to be the go-between, to talk the investors off the ledge.
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:26.740]   Because if we're going to trust this strategy, then that means we've got to trust this strategy,
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:33.020]   we've got to trust this manager all the way through, and not respond to panic, and not
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.540]   respond to euphoric greed.
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.580]   If we're not going to stay the course in that situation, we should never start.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.660]   If we can't handle the ups and downs and the volatility of owning this company, or owning
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:50.040]   this portfolio that this manager is managing, we should never start.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.880]   And so my job, what I saw as a financial advisor, was largely to help investors manage their
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:00.060]   emotions and help them try to help predict a little bit, hey, here's what the emotions
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.280]   you're going to face.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.120]   Because if you're warned about those things, then you know in advance, OK, here's what
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.740]   I'm going to face.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.240]   So that would be a good example.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.560]   And so in this world, because this is most investment still currently, or actively managed
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:25.040]   mutual funds that people own, don't try to -- my summary statement is don't try to get
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.600]   in or out based upon the bull market or the bear market.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   Know what you own.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.440]   And if you're happy with what you own, if you're happy with the job that your manager
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.440]   is doing, then stick with them.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:43.000]   Because you ham tie -- what's the -- hamstring -- I don't know what the cliche is, but you
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.700]   screw it all up when you tell your portfolio manager, here, you can have my money when
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.280]   markets are going up.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.000]   But all of a sudden I see that your performance is underperforming, so all of a sudden I'm
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   going to pull my money out.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   No, it's your money.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.440]   You've got the prerogative to do it.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.080]   But it sure makes your manager's job a lot more difficult.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.040]   And if you understand what your manager is doing, because you read your prospectus, and
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.200]   you understand that your growth manager is out looking for companies that are going to
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.240]   grow, your value manager is out looking for companies that are bargain priced right now,
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:19.160]   maybe you've got a manager that is using a top-down investment approach.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.720]   So in this situation, this manager is making their choices based upon the expectation of
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.160]   the macro economy.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.960]   So he's seeing, okay, the economy is going to go down, he's adjusting.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.680]   On the other hand -- and so if this manager is saying, I foresee this decline in economic
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.160]   prices, he's already adjusting the portfolio to that.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.800]   On the other hand, if you're using a manager that's using more of a bottom-up approach,
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.480]   well this person is ignoring the macro economy, or at least not considering that to be the
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.440]   highest value, and they're focusing on the individual companies.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:50.920]   And he's trying to say, well, yes, we have headwinds coming for the general economy,
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   but here's a company that's going to sail right through that headwinds.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.180]   And so if you're choosing a manager and that's their style that they're doing, then the headwinds
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.220]   mean nothing because they've already adjusted the portfolio for that.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:08.800]   So hopefully that's clear, but the key is that you've got to understand what you actually
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.600]   own with your investments.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.680]   And even if you're worried about them performing, underperforming, recognize that your managers
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.280]   are going to be judged based upon their benchmarks.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.520]   So the managers are going to be judged based upon their peers and on their benchmark returns,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.280]   and so they are accounting for that in their portfolio.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.920]   So if they're trying to -- let's say that they have a suspicion that there are headwinds
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.120]   in the economy, so therefore it's likely that we're going to be entering into a bear market.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.040]   They're going to adjust their strategy to try to deal with that, and they're going to
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.080]   try to outperform the benchmark, which is going to be probably some index such as the
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:45.120]   S&P 500 index, and they're going to try to outperform that benchmark because that benchmark
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.500]   is going to take a tumble.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.400]   And so they're going to put some kind of strategy in place to try to limit the returns.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:57.640]   So just simply understand that if you are using these strategies, which these are the
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:03.280]   most common strategies to use, the best thing you could do is ignore the bear market and
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:09.720]   trust your managers to do it, or if you're not hiring active managers, trust your -- trust
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.840]   your -- you know, the efficient market hypothesis to bring you through.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.760]   And in that time, you should -- I'm going to go on a tangent here for a moment.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.000]   The other thing is you've got to reinterpret what a bear market actually means.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.880]   In a bear market, if you are in an accumulation phase of your financial life, where you're
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:32.940]   accumulating money, you should be rejoicing over a bear market because it gives you opportunities
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.080]   to invest more money.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.880]   And for some reason with stocks and bonds, for some reason with stocks and bonds, people
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.060]   don't view things rationally.
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:45.440]   So if you go down and you -- whether you are -- I don't know what you're into buying, but
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.480]   let's say you're into buying, you know, electronic gadgets or clothes or something like that,
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.280]   and if you were going to go down to your favorite store and all of a sudden see a bargain bin
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.480]   with your favorite electronic gadgets and your favorite clothes, and there's a big sign
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.240]   above them that says 50% off, you would double up or triple up and buy as many of those things
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.720]   as you could, right?
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.920]   In stocks it's the same way.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:13.800]   A good manager to someone who's thinking about investments, buying companies is exactly the
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   same thing.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.760]   And if you wake up and you say, "Look, all of my favorite companies, I've been watching
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.080]   this company, you know, I want to buy Apple stock."
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.880]   I think they're still the number one highest market cap, so we'll pick on Apple.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.720]   I'm not recommending you buy Apple stock, okay?
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.320]   If you say, "I want to buy Apple stock," and you love Apple products and you're convinced
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.580]   that Apple is the way to go, but you've been sitting back looking at the price of Apple
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.800]   stock and saying, "Ugh, I'm just not so comfortable with this price."
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.400]   If you woke up the next day and all of a sudden saw on your morning news show that Apple price
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.780]   had plummeted in value by 50% overnight, and you knew there was nothing necessarily rational
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.280]   that was driving that, it wasn't that all of a sudden there was a big scandal, it wasn't
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:56.080]   that their product blew up and they were going to face a massive lawsuit, you would be rejoicing,
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.080]   or at least I would.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.520]   You would be thrilled, and you'd double up and you'd sell your car, you'd sell your house,
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.400]   you'd sell anything you could to get your hands on that Apple stock at 50% off.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.040]   This is what someone who is comfortable with markets and comfortable with investments,
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:14.360]   this is how they think, is that this is an advantage to load up on your favorite companies
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.880]   at bargain basement prices.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.200]   But in general, the general public doesn't think of this.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.440]   Now here's the problem.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.560]   That only works in your accumulation phase.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.160]   So if you're in the accumulation phase, that would be how you would think.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.440]   But if you're living on your portfolio and you're sitting back and saying, and you wake
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:33.720]   up and all of a sudden your portfolio value is destroyed in value by 50%, you're sweating
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.120]   bullets, which is why we need good financial planning.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:40.040]   We're going to get to that after I finish my conversation on, and I'm going to answer
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.040]   your question on how to protect yourself.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   But recognize that these situations are very unique.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.000]   I'm in the accumulation phase.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.680]   My father is in the distribution phase.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:55.320]   So I would be rejoicing if the Dow tomorrow morning, if I woke up tomorrow morning and
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:01.360]   the Dow had plummeted from 17,000 points to 7,000 points, I would be dancing in the street
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:06.280]   and I would be trying to persuade my wife to sell everything we own and buy stocks.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.620]   But my dad, on the other hand, he'd be in a different situation.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:14.440]   Because if he's living on those values, that's going to dramatically affect the value.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:19.440]   So if he's doing some kind of share liquidation strategy to provide for his retirement income,
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.240]   this would be a problem.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.400]   So that's where good financial planning comes in.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.600]   So it's not a simple answer.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.920]   I want to keep going though because I hope this helps.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.800]   In one way, there are no simple answers with financial planning.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.840]   In another way, there are tons of simple answers in financial planning.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.960]   And that's what you're going to find throughout the show is that there's tons of little maxims
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.320]   and little things that make sense to people.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.240]   But as you start to dig in, you'll find lots of situations where those don't apply.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.080]   And you've got to look at your individual self, your individual person, and your individual
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.680]   situation for the answer.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.680]   So let's say you're a trader.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.080]   Trader, not trator.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.080]   So you're a trader.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.400]   You are trading your stocks.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.640]   So if you are a trader, you may be doing this yourself or you may be hiring a manager to
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.000]   trade this for you.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.480]   So one of the, some people say advantages, some people say disadvantages, of mutual funds
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:17.200]   is that in general, mutual funds are not permitted to use some of the more sophisticated and
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.080]   riskier strategies.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.640]   Again, some people would see this as an advantage, some people as a disadvantage.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.000]   I could argue both sides equally well.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.880]   I'm not going to share my opinion on it.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:32.360]   My job is to teach you about how the perspective risks and the perspective advantages.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:38.960]   So in general, mutual funds are restricted from using any or using a lot of margin.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.660]   So using leverage, buying, borrowing money to buy and sell securities.
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.480]   They're limited on selling short.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:49.200]   They're limited on using derivatives to trade investments.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.760]   So then you go over to the hedge fund world.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.040]   Well, in the hedge fund world, you've got a lot more freedom.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.320]   Hedge funds are allowed to invest.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.320]   They're just simply not restricted like mutual funds are.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.360]   Hedge funds can invest in a wider variety of assets.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:08.400]   They can do stuff like take up positions in really illiquid assets that can be really
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.280]   difficult to sell.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.960]   So this would be where you go in and this is not something that's very tradable, whereas
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.960]   a mutual fund can't take up the position.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.400]   Let me explain why.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.040]   A mutual fund is usually limited from exposing a large percentage of its portfolio.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.240]   There's all kinds of rules as far as the percentages.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.520]   But a mutual fund is limited from exposing a large percentage of its portfolio to an
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.840]   illiquid investment.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:33.880]   So if there's a company that is there on -- if there's a company that a mutual fund manager
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.640]   is looking at, but this company is going through financial distress and is probably going to
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.480]   be very difficult to sell, the mutual fund manager probably isn't going to be able to
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.920]   buy it.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.840]   Because if all of a sudden that mutual fund's clients come and redeem their shares, the
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:52.400]   manager has to be able to sell that investment out and sell the investment to be able to
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.720]   allow the investors in the mutual fund to redeem their shares.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.400]   Now a hedge fund can invest in the illiquid assets.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.280]   And the reason is because the hedge fund can put in rules that lock up the investor's money.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:08.920]   So a hedge fund can require its investors to keep their money in the funds for months
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.040]   or even years at a time.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:16.080]   This is why, if my memory is correct, I think a few years ago you saw the hedge fund bought
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.400]   -- what was it?
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.400]   Chrysler.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.400]   Daimler Chrysler.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.280]   When Daimler sold Chrysler Corp. -- what was the hedge fund that bought?
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   I don't remember the name.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.520]   But there was a hedge fund that bought Chrysler Corporation.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.880]   I can't remember if they still sell it or not.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.040]   I had to Google it and research it.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.040]   I don't remember.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.040]   So you go check that out.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.200]   But in that situation, you have a struggling company.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.400]   That's a very illiquid investment.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.520]   That was different than at the time buying Ford stock.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.800]   So if you could buy Ford Corporation stock, that was a very active market.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.400]   That was different than Chrysler because Chrysler was facing some issues.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.800]   So the hedge fund can come in and the hedge fund investor has a lock-up period where they're
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.640]   not permitted to pull their money, no matter if they want it or not.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.320]   The hedge fund manager can just say, "Sorry, I'm not giving you your money back."
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.620]   And so now that hedge fund manager has the time to pursue something like that, to pursue
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.280]   an illiquid investment.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.520]   Well what does that mean with regard to a bear market?
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.080]   Well that's when a hedge fund manager is going to be making all of their major investments
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.460]   if they have it.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.540]   Because they've got the lock-up, they can go ahead and they've got the lock-up period
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.160]   where they've got the money guaranteed.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.000]   And now they can go ahead and do that and they can dispose of the asset over time according
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.120]   to their plan.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.120]   This is why in general, hedge funds are limited to accredited investors.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.640]   Basically the idea behind an accredited investor is an accredited investor has to own at least
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.960]   5 million bucks of investments, ignoring their primary residence.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:34.720]   And they are the only ones that can invest in-- and there's another thing on income.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.160]   I can't remember, it's something like $250,000 of income or something like that.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.400]   That's what makes an accredited investor.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.320]   And the idea here is that an accredited investor should be smart enough to do their own due
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   diligence.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.340]   So a hedge fund can't go out and if you pick up Money Magazine, you'll see mutual fund
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.120]   advertisements all over the place.
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.560]   You'll never see a hedge fund advertisement in Money Magazine because a hedge fund is
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.100]   not allowed to advertise to the general public.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.000]   They can only market themselves to an accredited investor.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.520]   Because these strategies are sophisticated and they come with a higher degree of risk
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.680]   of loss.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   And so that's the difference.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.920]   So they might make a lot more money.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.920]   I don't know.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.520]   I have to go and research what ended up happening with Chrysler because it would be an interesting
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.520]   case study.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.520]   I just remember that from a few years ago.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.000]   I was paying attention to it.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   But I don't know if they made money or not.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.080]   I hope they did.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.200]   But this would be one of the major differences.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   A hedge fund can use extensive amounts of leverage.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:31.200]   So the hedge fund can borrow a lot of money to try to blow up the investment returns.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.100]   So that can be awesome if it turns out well.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:40.000]   That can also be really tough if it doesn't work.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.800]   Leverage is a two-sided sword.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.280]   And so depending on your risk profile as far as how comfortable you are with that, which
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.040]   would come down to personal financial planning, that would be a major thing to consider.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:55.840]   If you didn't have anything to lose by employing a lot of leverage, it may be smart to employ
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.840]   it.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.480]   If you've got a lot to lose by employing leverage and you don't need it, what's the point of
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.760]   an extra $20 million if you've already got some?
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   Don't risk it.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.080]   It would be silly to risk it.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.440]   And that would be a very individual decision.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.920]   A hedge fund can use short sales.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.480]   So they can sell stock short.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:20.120]   So in this situation, if a hedge fund manager were saying, I'm going to go ahead and I perceive
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.920]   economic headwinds, I perceive a bear market coming, well, they can short all over the
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.920]   place.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.920]   They could short individual stocks.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.920]   They could short the general market.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.120]   They could short specific asset classes.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.800]   They could short all kinds of things.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.480]   And that would allow them to make gains when the market prices are going down if their
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.640]   shorting strategy works out well.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:43.860]   So there's a lot of different things that these funds could do.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:49.960]   And just to give you an idea, I don't know if you've ever studied sophisticated portfolio
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.960]   management.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   It's fascinating.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.920]   But you would have different strategies.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.960]   Here are a few strategies that I just made some notes on that I thought would be fun
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   to go over.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:03.080]   So a hedge fund manager could use the equity long short.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:12.400]   And so this was the strategy that was used and still is used-- was used, excuse me--
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.800]   by the oldest hedge fund, which was a fund called the A.W.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.280]   Jones and Company.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:22.880]   So under this strategy, what the manager does is the manager will buy some stocks long and
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.880]   sell some stocks short.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.680]   This is still the most popular hedge fund strategy today.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.720]   And so I think industry numbers-- I was pulling this from-- well, this is a few years old
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.720]   now.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:38.560]   But I'm pulling this from Robert Pozen and Teresa Hamacher's book called "The Fund Industry."
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:43.200]   And they say about 30% of all hedge fund assets globally are allocated to the equity long
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.440]   short.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:51.280]   And so here, the hedge fund manager is ignoring the economic headwinds as far as in general.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:55.640]   And they're buying stocks that they consider to be undervalued long.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.440]   So they're hoping that those stocks go up.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.760]   And they're buying stocks that they consider to be overvalued.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.680]   And they're selling them short, hoping that the prices will go down.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.260]   So this is not a strategy for the general market.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.720]   This is a strategy for the specific companies.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.640]   Although, theoretically, you could use this in asset classes or in various parts of the
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   market.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.160]   Number two would be the relative value strategy or arbitrage.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.580]   So relative value is a long short strategy.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:25.840]   But it would involve the specific types of securities or assets other than stocks.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:31.160]   So you could use a strategy called a merger arbitrage.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.680]   And so under this scenario, a hedge fund would buy shares of a company that is in the process
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:41.000]   of being acquired and short the shares of the acquirer and try to take the value of
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.120]   the arbitrage relationship, the difference in pricing between those two stocks.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:51.100]   A relative value manager would look at the past relationships between different securities
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:57.120]   that are issued by the same company and try to profit from where they're different from
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.200]   historical norms.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:04.640]   One kind of variation of this would be convertible arbitrage, which would mean you would buy
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.040]   a convertible security and sell short the underlying stock.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.160]   So if there were a convertible security that you could get a hands on and then just sell
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:18.260]   short the stock and wait on the arbitrage opportunity between the two to make your money.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.260]   Intercredit strategy.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.000]   So you would look at the relative value between different types of fixed income securities
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.240]   such as corporate bonds versus government bonds and try to exploit any mispricing that
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.440]   you could find.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.480]   So a hedge fund manager could pursue a distressed strategy.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:37.120]   So this would be buying the securities or other assets of a company that's in or near
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.160]   bankruptcy.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.040]   And so you remember movies back from the 80s of the corporate titans going in and trying
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:46.080]   to say, "We're going to buy up this company that's in near bankruptcy and sell off all
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.080]   the assets."
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.820]   And if that happens, you just got to find the right opportunity.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:50.820]   Shareholder activism.
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.340]   So this is where hedge funds get involved a lot.
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:57.380]   And they say, "We have this company, but we're going to try to make a major change in the
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.580]   way this company is managed.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:05.220]   So we're going to try to buy enough of the shares that we can get some voice in it, or
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.660]   we're going to try to market the changes that we want.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.380]   So we're going to market to the shareholders and we're going to say, "Listen, here's how
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.180]   the company could be better served so that at the next annual meeting we can clear the
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:18.300]   board of directors from these three directors who are standing in our way and install our
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:22.860]   new board of directors to take the company in the way that we're going to, that we think
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.860]   is better."
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.820]   You could use a global macro view strategy.
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:31.740]   So you could say, "We have a view on what the macroeconomic events that are coming."
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.380]   So for example, changes in interest rates, changes in the relative value of currencies,
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.540]   maybe the global supply and demand for natural resources.
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.780]   We're going to take a position on this and we're going to make a bet that this happens."
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:48.500]   And so probably the most famous example of that is George Soros' short sale of the British
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.540]   Pound back in 1992.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:54.740]   And so he was known as the man who broke the Bank of England because he sold short the
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.780]   British Pound, made, I don't know, was it a billion dollars, something like that?
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.280]   I'd have to go research it again.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.660]   But made a huge amount of money because he said, "This is what's going to happen."
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:09.340]   There was a guy, I forget his name, but there was a guy back in 2008 that sold short the
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.460]   housing.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.180]   What instrument did he use?
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:24.300]   I forget what he actually sold short, whether it was the securities, the package securities
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.300]   that were being traded.
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:30.900]   But basically he was a doctor, a practicing medical physician who enjoyed this and he
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.900]   sold this.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:35.340]   There's a game on it called, I think it was called, there was a book, I think it was called
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.340]   The Great Short.
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.580]   I have to go and check it.
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.180]   It's on my reading list.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.180]   But he sold short the whole housing market and made tons of money because he said, "Look,
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.580]   the whole housing market is falling apart here."
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.580]   And he made a ton of money on it.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.580]   Managed futures.
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:53.980]   So managed futures would be doing some sort of commodity trading where a managed futures
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:58.820]   hedge fund would invest in futures contracts on various types of commodities.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:02.540]   So energy, metals, grains, things like that, and on the financial market.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:07.500]   So they would trade the futures market without, based upon their hunch about the direction
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.540]   of the investment.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:15.540]   You could combine all these together and you could combine all these strategies, pick and
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.940]   pull from the ones that you want, add in leverage, borrow money to enhance your returns.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.900]   I mean there's all kinds of things that you could do if you were running a hedge fund.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:28.460]   But if you were in that kind of fund, and the hedge fund is a good example, you got
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:32.620]   your money locked up and you just got to sit back and you got to trust your manager.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.780]   So a lot of times people aren't familiar with the concept of trusting their active portfolio
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.860]   manager or trusting their passive strategy.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.500]   They're much more familiar with the idea, however, if you're buying into a hedge fund
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.700]   and they tell you there's a two-year lockup on your money, well now you've just got to
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.980]   go with it.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.300]   If you're running your own portfolio.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:55.420]   So let's say that you are running your own portfolio and you're trading some individual
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:56.420]   stocks.
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.820]   You could use some very basic techniques.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:04.020]   So if you wanted to protect yourself from a bear market, you might put a collar on your
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:09.620]   stock and you say, "Okay, if the price rises from $20 to $30 and then it retreats to $28,
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:16.300]   I want to sell that stock out automatically at $28 a share."
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:22.260]   You could do it where over time, if you're, let's say you buy the stock at $10 and you
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:26.400]   say, "I'm going to sell it out at $12, I'm going to sell 20%.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.980]   At $14, I'm going to sell 20%.
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:33.640]   At $18, I'm going to sell 20% and I'll keep riding some, but then I'll put a collar on
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:41.780]   it that would allow the value to still be held if the market were to decline."
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:43.800]   Maybe you're going to trade options.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:49.260]   So one way to protect yourself in a bear market, you may own a stock and you say, "Well, I
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:54.200]   own this stock, but I'm concerned about the market going down, so I'm going to go ahead
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.780]   and buy a put option on the stock.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.300]   So a put option would allow me to sell the stock at a guaranteed price."
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:03.820]   Now you're going to pay for the option, so you may choose not to exercise the option,
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:12.120]   but that would allow you to have a strategy in place if the value of the stock were to
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.460]   decline.
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:14.460]   Or you know what?
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:18.300]   You could just simply be confident in the company and just sit tight and buy more when
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.260]   the price dumps.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:26.860]   The example that I think of here is, can you imagine, let's pick on Walmart.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.420]   Walmart stock, Sam Walton distributes the majority of the stock, goes out to his children
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.180]   and to the Walton Foundation.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.780]   So they've got massive amounts of stock and they're vested in the company.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:41.420]   Can you imagine if Walmart stock declines in value by 20% because they get some stupid
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:47.300]   lawsuit or they get some union issue or they get some bad press or they have a truck that
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.040]   blows up on the side of the road.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.260]   Can you imagine the Walton Foundation and the Walton family members all of a sudden
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:58.100]   saying that's it, we don't have confidence in our company, we don't think we're going
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.740]   to come back from this, we've got this 20% loss, we've just got to sell our stock.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.460]   No, I mean I can't, maybe you can, but I can't even imagine that.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.540]   They would say, you know what, we're so confident in our company, we'll buy everything
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.540]   that we can.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.300]   You saw that this last year if you pay attention to this stuff.
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:17.500]   And you saw that the Walton family is buying back as much of their own stock as they can.
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.700]   And so they're looking at the marketplace and they're saying, you know what, the
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.420]   best investment we can find right now is our stock.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.540]   It's undervalued so we're going to buy it back.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.660]   And we're going to go ahead and buy our own stock and increase our share price by
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.340]   lowering the number of shares outstanding on the market.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:35.300]   Can you imagine the Buffett kids or a better example would be the Bill and Melinda Gates
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:39.900]   Foundation where Warren Buffett gives most of his stock, his Berkshire Hathaway stock
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.220]   to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and he's doing it over time.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:47.220]   Can you imagine the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation portfolio manager waking up one
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:52.380]   morning and seeing that Berkshire Hathaway for no external reason that anyone can find,
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.980]   but all of a sudden there's no major fraud that was discovered.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:58.140]   They didn't pull an Enron or a WorldCom.
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:03.820]   But all of a sudden he wakes up and says the Berkshire Hathaway stock price declined by
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:06.500]   15% or 20% or 30%.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:10.860]   So therefore the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, we got to dump our, what is it, $40 billion
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.860]   or something.
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:13.300]   I could be off on that number.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:19.060]   But we got to dump our billions of dollars of stock into the market because of this 20%
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.220]   decline.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.780]   I can't imagine it.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:27.260]   And so the problem is that hopefully those examples help to understand a little bit.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.100]   But those people are thinking about the great company that we own.
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:35.940]   Berkshire Hathaway, this huge, widely diversified company with lines of income and profits across
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:40.780]   the entire world, across various industries, this really strong balance sheet, these world
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:45.660]   class company managers running it, this incredible culture, this incredible reputation, this
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:47.380]   incredibly low basis.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.220]   We've got these good companies at these great prices.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.660]   We've got a great reputation where basically everyone thinks Warren Buffett's God and if
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:56.900]   he says something about investing it must be true.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.940]   And that therefore Warren says this is what you should do so this is what you should do
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.140]   and the whole world jumps to it.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:07.340]   Can you imagine them just really even being concerned about those fluctuations in stock
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:08.340]   price?
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.940]   No, because they know the underlying company.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.180]   Same thing with Walmart.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.900]   Can you imagine the Walton family saying, well, our price value declined in 10% so therefore
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:19.500]   we're just going to throw up our hands and say that's it, we got to leave this business?
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.340]   No, because they know the company.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:27.460]   They understand that a stock is ownership in a company.
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.580]   Now are there people trading all around the edges of that?
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:31.580]   Absolutely.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.700]   I guarantee you there's people trading Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.180]   There's people trading Walmart.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.580]   You've got everything from a flash trader owning a stock for a few microseconds on the
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.120]   way through up in New York where he's got these guys that you pay extra to get your
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:50.220]   Bloomberg terminal closer to the Internet connection so that your computer can start
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:55.260]   the trade a couple microseconds before your competitor across the street and so you can
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:59.820]   profit on the arbitrage between this tiny little fraction of a stock price.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.860]   Yes, there's people doing that every day.
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:04.540]   Could you be a day trader where you're saying I'm going to go on each and every and I'm
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.900]   going to hold my stock out in the morning and the evening and really trade it with one
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:08.900]   day?
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:09.900]   Absolutely.
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.200]   Can you do some sort of swing trade where you're covering out over a couple of days
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.780]   or a couple of weeks?
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:14.780]   Absolutely.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:19.460]   But in none of those situations are you worrying about the general bear market?
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:23.940]   The micro trader, the day trader, he doesn't care about what the market is doing over this
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.940]   several month period of time.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:29.580]   He or she cares about what's going on within their trading horizon.
[00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.100]   Now could you be a momentum trader and kind of over a longer period?
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:33.100]   Absolutely.
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:35.180]   Could you be looking for some kind of good news that you think is going to happen?
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:36.180]   Absolutely.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:41.500]   There's people doing trading on every single aspect of it.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:45.700]   But all of these things together make up the market.
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:49.320]   It is not stupid just to sit back and say, "You know what?
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:55.060]   My granddaddy started Coca-Cola and my granddaddy left me $10 million of Coca-Cola stock.
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.580]   And I think Coca-Cola is pretty good.
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.780]   They're in hundreds of countries around the world.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:04.220]   They've got this incredible moat, as the investment people would say.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:06.100]   It's a great well-run company.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.420]   I've got good managers."
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:13.100]   I'm going to completely ignore, with the exception of reading my annual report, I'm going to
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:16.540]   completely ignore what happens to the Coca-Cola stock on a daily basis.
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:20.580]   And I'm going to go play golf every day or whatever their version of that is.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.860]   Is that stupid?
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:22.860]   I don't think so.
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:27.380]   I'd be happy to own $10 million of Coca-Cola stock and I'd feel, "Hey, it's pretty good."
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:31.940]   I might go ahead and I might like to own a few other companies in case something happened.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:39.900]   But if my granddaddy started Coca-Cola or whoever the story is, whatever it is, what
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.900]   do I have to fear?
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:44.460]   I mean, again, good financial planning is going to come into that, personal financial
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:49.740]   planning, lifestyle, having a margin in your life, not being over-committed, being able
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.540]   to handle the swings if the dividend has to be cut, those types of things.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.820]   But that's called financial planning.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:59.380]   So the point of this is trust your managers if you have them.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:03.820]   And if you don't have managers, understand your philosophy.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:07.740]   And if you don't understand your philosophy, don't invest in stocks.
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:12.100]   If you can't handle it, if you don't have a plan in place in advance for the bear market,
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.740]   then don't ever get in in the first place.
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:17.660]   In some ways, one of the best things and one of the worst things that ever happened was
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.180]   401(k)s.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:22.620]   And we'll talk -- I always say, "We'll talk about this in the future."
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:23.780]   There's so much to talk about.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:27.380]   I think I could do a thousand shows of two hours long talking about things I'm interested
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.380]   in.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.380]   But there's so many 401(k)s.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:33.740]   And if you look at kind of the history of the 401(k), these days, most people have some
[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:39.060]   version of a 401(k), whether it's that actual 401(k), whether it's the non-profit equivalent,
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.820]   which would be a 403(b), whether it's the smaller business equivalent, which would be
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:46.060]   a SEP IRA or a Simple IRA or something like that.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:50.020]   Most people have, these days, some kind of plan that they can adjust the investments
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.180]   as far as their pension plan, their individual pension plan.
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:55:00.460]   Originally, in case you're interested, originally a 401(k) is more appropriately designed as
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.860]   a profit-sharing plan.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.780]   It is technically a profit-sharing plan.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.460]   And that's what it can be set up.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:13.180]   But what the 401(k) added is it added what's called 401(k) provisions to a profit-sharing
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:14.180]   plan.
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:19.540]   And the 401(k) allowed people to defer some of their own income into that account.
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:26.420]   So to not have to pay taxes on the money currently to be able to defer their income.
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:30.780]   And so over the last about 40, 50 years, you've seen a tremendous change in the corporate
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:36.260]   world between a traditional defined benefit pension, which is where I work at this company,
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:41.940]   I turn 65, they guarantee to pay me 60% of my finishing salary for the rest of my life.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:47.020]   You had a tremendous conversion from a defined benefit pension to a defined contribution
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:48.020]   pension.
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:51.460]   And in a defined benefit pension, you had an investment manager.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:54.060]   This would be a professional investment manager.
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:58.320]   And this is the person who's responsible for making sure that our pension is funded such
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.440]   that we can support these payments that we've promised.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:03.880]   And now it's on the people.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:09.100]   So now you can pull up on your phone, you can log into your Fidelity 401(k) account,
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.120]   and you can buy and trade stocks right in there on your phone.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.100]   Now is that an advantage for some people?
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.740]   It's a huge advantage.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:17.600]   It's a huge advantage.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.820]   If you're an investment guy, and the fact that you can sit up there and you love to
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:26.380]   trade stocks, and you can do this in your 401(k), and you can defer $17,500 in there,
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:30.300]   you could throw in another $5,500 if you're over the age of 50.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.220]   You can have a profit sharing contribution in there.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:36.300]   You could get $51,000 into that account every year.
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:41.740]   I was talking to somebody yesterday about setting up a solo 401(k) and getting $51,000
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:42.740]   in there.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:45.980]   So you're telling me that I can -- so if I were a stock trader, I would say, "You're
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:47.260]   telling me that I can set up an account.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:52.140]   If I structure it right, I can get $50,000 in this account, and I can do this before
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:55.260]   paying any income tax at all, and I can buy and sell.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:58.940]   I can ignore all of the short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains rules.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.700]   I can day trade in this account on a 401(k).
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:02.700]   You're telling me I can do that?
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:03.700]   No.
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:04.700]   There's limitations.
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:06.780]   Ignore that I'm speaking in broad strokes.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:08.500]   But you're telling me I can do that right on my phone?
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:09.580]   That's amazing.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:15.580]   But yet for the average person who has no interest in trading stocks or has no interest
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:19.860]   in these funds, all they know to do is every few months they open up their computer and
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:23.180]   they say, "Oh, my mutual fund is down," and they switch the money to the mutual fund
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.900]   that has a green arrow next to it, and it's up 6% instead of the mine, which has a red
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.700]   arrow and is down 11%.
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:32.620]   This is the worst thing that ever happened to people's investment accounts.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.340]   And I think we know this intuitively.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:40.500]   This is where if you want to ask somebody kind of intuitively about doing it yourself
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:45.180]   versus hiring somebody, and you have the financial world that says, "Well, you're better off
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:49.180]   just doing it yourself," but yet you've got all these financial advisors that say, "Hire
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.180]   me.
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.180]   Hire me."
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.180]   I mean, the equivalent is this.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:56.740]   If you could invest your money with the Harvard Endowment Fund and you could have the manager
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:02.060]   of the Harvard Endowment Fund investing your money with that fund, would you rather do
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:08.220]   that or would you rather invest the money yourself and choose your investments for yourself?
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:12.580]   The majority of people in my experience that I've talked to have given that kind of either/or
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:15.620]   would say, "I'd rather have my money alongside the Harvard Endowment."
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:18.980]   And that's kind of how pensions used to be, 'cause the pension legally had to provide
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:25.020]   for the person under this certain formula payout, and now it doesn't have to do so.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.860]   So trust your managers.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.460]   And then the last thing I have on this, and hopefully this is interesting.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.380]   Hopefully this is interesting.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.820]   I just looked down.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.860]   I've spent 50 minutes answering this question.
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:41.460]   But understand the difference between price and value.
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:47.060]   The example that I always use is real estate.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:52.980]   Now real estate and stocks, stocks have a dramatic disadvantage from real estate.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:57.420]   In real estate, if I were to tell you every single day how much your house is worth, that
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:00.260]   would drive you nuts.
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.500]   One day I come out and I say, "Hey, listen.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.500]   I'll give you today $182,433 for your house."
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:09.300]   And then the next day I come out and say, "I'll give you $191,673 for your house."
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:14.580]   And the next day I come out and say, "I'll give you $211,932 for your house."
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:19.860]   And the next day I come out and say, "Hey, today it's $133,467.67."
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:20.860]   That would drive you nuts.
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:23.180]   That's what stocks do when you pay attention to them every day.
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:26.120]   Every day there's a price, price, price, price, price, price, price.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.340]   Does price determine value?
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:32.580]   Does the value of your house as a place to shelter your family and a place to have a
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:38.300]   home built together, does that change based upon the price?
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.300]   It doesn't.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:44.180]   Now, the price is important over the long term, but the reason why people will sit and
[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:48.660]   own a house for a long time and why people who are real estate investors will very rarely
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:52.980]   trade their houses is A, because they're not very liquid because it's got a massive dollar
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:57.140]   figure next to it, but B, because it's really hard to sell and you don't actually know the
[00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:00.940]   final price until the sale happens.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.260]   That's the only time you know it.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:06.420]   And so it's a lot easier when in the reality the actual price of your house is up and down
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:10.260]   and up and down and up and down all the time and there's bear markets and bull markets
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.260]   on your house.
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:14.580]   You're not aware of it because you're just simply living in that house and you have the
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:15.820]   value of the house.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:22.860]   Well, to me the most rational strategies for investments follow the same exact plan.
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:30.260]   The most rational values for investments follow the idea that, excuse me, the most rational
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.580]   plans for investing follow the same idea, which is I'm going to focus on the value of
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.500]   my investment if you're investing.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.260]   Or if you're trading, you're going to focus on, I'm going to focus on the mechanics of
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:47.140]   my trade and here's the trade that I'm going to do and I'm going to put this insurance
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.140]   in place in case I'm wrong.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.260]   I'm going to buy/sell these options.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.900]   I'm going to buy/sell these call options, these put options.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.900]   I'm going to put this collar.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.420]   I'm going to put a straddle.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:59.820]   You can do an option strategy where you make money on the downside and you make money on
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:03.300]   the upside and you only lose money if the market is flat.
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.060]   You can make an option strategy where you only make money if the option is flat, if
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:12.300]   the market price of the underlying security is flat and that you lose money if it goes
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.300]   up or down.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:14.300]   You can bet it both ways.
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.940]   Now, those are such individual examples, but my point is that all of this stuff together
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.500]   makes up the market.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.820]   So when I said how I would deliver market news is if I were actually doing a daily market
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:31.500]   news update, I would say, "Today, millions and millions and millions of market participants
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.700]   bought and sold things based upon their own personal situation.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:40.380]   And the values and the prices at which things were bought and sold wandered around randomly
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:45.220]   based upon the individual person's strategies and philosophies."
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:49.820]   Now in general, we saw that the general trend was this, and so therefore these indexes that
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.340]   we manage is this.
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:57.020]   And we think that it's possible that this bad news on the jobs report had this impact,
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:00.140]   although we know there were probably some people that made a bunch of money off of that.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:04.500]   And we think it's possible that this negative forecast from this company analyst affected
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.980]   this company's price.
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:09.180]   But the reality is we bet that somebody had that trade and made a bunch of money off of
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.820]   that, and we can't actually report that because all we're reporting is the current market
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.060]   price of these basket of stocks.
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:21.220]   And we have no idea who actually made how much money because there is a way bigger derivatives
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:27.540]   market in place than the value of all the market prices of the companies combined.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.880]   That would be how I would report financial news.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:36.540]   So a substantial answer to you, Mr. or Ms. Moto-Jones, I didn't look to see the details.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.900]   I don't think there was an actual name there.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.860]   And that would be my answer to you.
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:47.540]   And so my encouragement to you would be understand your strategy and spend a lot of time learning
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.700]   before you actually do any investing.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.820]   And then figure out what strategies make sense to you.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:57.020]   And if your strategy makes sense to you, don't worry about the bear market.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:02.180]   Unless your strategy has in its buildup, in its philosophy, a strategy for the bear market,
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.340]   in which case you already know that and you never ask me the question.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.940]   I hope that helps.
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:10.260]   Okay, next question.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:15.060]   I did not expect that one to take an hour, but hopefully it came across clearly.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:19.580]   And I was thinking a lot about that Monday show, trying to figure out if I did a good
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:25.340]   job of talking about why I was -- I didn't feel like I did a good job on Monday.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:30.220]   So hopefully this helped to fill in some of your thoughts and understanding a little bit.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:35.500]   Okay, next question from Steve, Twitter handle @SteveOnomics.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.700]   His question, best investment strategy for a young couple looking to buy a house in the
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:41.980]   next three to five years.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.940]   So Steve, couple answers to this question for you.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:48.660]   Number one is I don't have an investment strategy that's going to work.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.180]   And I'll explain why.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.200]   And you're probably expecting this answer.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.220]   But I don't know of anything that you can do with money that is going to make a dramatic
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:01.660]   difference of the return that you get over a three to five year time period for where
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:05.340]   you're looking to buy a house that involves a financial instrument.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.580]   And there are a couple of reasons for this.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.740]   The one that most people are familiar with, which is absolutely accurate, is the matter
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.380]   of time horizon.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:19.460]   So in general, the price you pay to get high returns on your money is in general volatility.
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:26.180]   If there were no volatility, no ups and downs in the prices of things, then in general,
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.580]   then you get a lowered return.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:34.580]   So this is why if you look at the highest long-term growth rates among asset classes
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.100]   of stocks is among small cap stocks.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.740]   So small cap means smaller companies with a market capitalization under a certain dollar
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.780]   amount, which we all argue on what that number is.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.460]   But let's just ignore it for today, small cap stocks.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:49.860]   So small cap stocks, you have the most ups and downs because these are the companies
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.380]   that are the most volatile.
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:55.300]   There's a major difference between a brand new technology company with a market cap of
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:05:01.220]   $2 billion versus GE as far as their business plan and the stability of it.
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:07.420]   So small cap stocks among asset classes have a higher rate of return over the long term,
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.060]   have a higher rate of return than do large cap stocks, but yet they're way more volatile
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:12.260]   over time.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:15.140]   So you say, OK, I get the higher return.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.700]   What about bonds versus stocks?
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:22.660]   Well, bonds-- and we'll go into this in detail on Wednesday with our stocks versus bond explanation--
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.340]   bonds are called fixed income investments.
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:28.060]   So in general, you know how much of a payment you're going to get on that bond.
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:33.100]   Now the bond price is going to wander around a lot based upon the actual current-- based
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.400]   upon the interest rates and the changes of the interest rates.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.580]   But you know what you're going to get.
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.340]   It's a guaranteed payment.
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.140]   And so as long as the company doesn't default on the payment, then you know I've got in
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.140]   place.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.140]   I've got this amount of money coming in.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:49.460]   So there's a lot lower return, but there's also less volatility if we ignore temporarily
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.500]   interest rates.
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.620]   Over the short term, interest rates of bonds can bring in dramatic volatility.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:57.540]   But just ignore that just for the sake of my simple example.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:01.380]   On the other hand, if you go down to the bank and you buy a CD, they're going to give you
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:07.180]   a very low nominal interest rate return.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:10.560]   But that's a guaranteed growth rate.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.680]   There's not going to be any fluctuation in the value because it's not traded.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.020]   It's not dependent on interest rates.
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:18.420]   It's not going to be the kind of thing-- we're not talking about negotiable CDs, which can
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:19.420]   be traded on the market.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:22.460]   We're only talking about just a traditional bank CD or even a savings account.
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:24.500]   You've just got a very simple value.
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:29.340]   Or a money market fund, where it's designed to keep the net asset value at a buck a share.
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.820]   Then we go in and we've got a very short term investment.
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.780]   So we've got not much return.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:39.180]   So the first answer as far as why it doesn't really matter-- and there is no investment
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.300]   strategy for three to five years.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.620]   And the reason is because three to five years is not in the world of investing.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.540]   Traditionally you'll hear, if you don't have about five years of time, you shouldn't be
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.780]   investing in stocks and things like that.
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.100]   That can be a little bit misleading.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:55.380]   But because if you've got six years, in a year you'll be in the five year time.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:56.900]   So what, should you sell out then?
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.540]   Depends on the situation.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.200]   This is very, very individual.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.980]   But the problem with house is that you've got a plan that in three to five years, you're
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.060]   going to need a large lump sum.
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:10.260]   So in that world, you can't stomach-- even if you had a six year time horizon, you need
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:13.700]   knew that six years from now, I'm going to need this lump sum.
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:19.700]   I still probably wouldn't invest it in stocks in general, because you're looking at a situation
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:27.380]   where you have a lump sum that's due on six years.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:33.580]   So unless you can put in a strategy-- so maybe you could purchase an individual bond that
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:38.540]   had a six year duration, or a specific-- it ended in six years.
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.620]   So in bond trading, we call this duration.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:45.180]   And so maybe you could put in some kind of immunized bond portfolio in place for six
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:46.180]   years.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:47.180]   But this is completely inaccessible.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:49.760]   I mean, that would be great if you had a lot of money.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.380]   But this is completely inaccessible to the average person who's trying to fund this portfolio
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:57.700]   for $100 a month over time, building it up, and finishes out.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.540]   Let me explain real quick what that means.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:03.380]   So if you had a lump sum, you could buy an immunized bond portfolio.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:07.340]   The idea behind an immunized bond portfolio is that you're trying to immunize the bond
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.140]   against a major change in interest rates.
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:15.260]   And you do this by adjusting the duration of the portfolio such that your exact goal--
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:19.220]   that you hit your exact goal, and you're going to have the money that you need in the exact
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.220]   goal.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.220]   A very simple explanation.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:22.960]   We'll go into it in detail another time.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.920]   But this doesn't work for an accumulation strategy.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:30.540]   Because if you're saving $500 a month towards the down payment on a house, or $1,000 a month,
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:36.420]   whatever it is, you can't buy a $500 new immunized bond portfolio every time.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:41.300]   And your whole portfolio falls apart if you're trying to fund it month by month.
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:45.100]   Now, you could if you had a huge lump sum now, and you knew I've got a specific expense
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.180]   that's fully due five years from now.
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:48.780]   You could theoretically do it.
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:51.860]   But you're not going to find a trader who's going to set it up for you, unless you're
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:53.300]   going to do that kind of thing yourself.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.580]   And I don't know how to do it.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.620]   This is a bond trading-- you need a portfolio manager.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:01.700]   And it's not the kind of thing you go on E-Trade and say, I'm going to do this.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.700]   I bet you could.
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.540]   I'm not smart enough to do it.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.660]   And if you are, come and tell me how to do it.
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:09.100]   Because it seems completely silly to me.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.380]   The numbers are too small.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.380]   You can't afford the advice.
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.460]   And that's the kind of thing that you would do.
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:17.100]   That's the kind of thing that would happen on an institutional scale if you had a large
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.700]   amount of money that you needed for a specific expenditure.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.520]   So you're in an accumulation phase, generally, if you're talking about an investment strategy.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.940]   And all of the investment strategies that are available to you as a retail investor,
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:31.360]   they're not really going to make a big difference.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.820]   And they're not going to make a big difference because of the volatility, first of all.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:39.380]   So unless you're willing to risk that five years from now-- in my example, Dow goes from,
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.860]   I don't know, maybe it's $25,000 five years from now.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:44.320]   And it goes from $25,000 to $12,000.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.640]   Or maybe it's at $12,000 five years from now.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.740]   And you're going to make it on the gain.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.920]   This doesn't work.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.760]   You can't invest in that period of time.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.120]   Because you can't run the risk of the money not being there when you want to buy the house.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120]   So what do you do?
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.120]   Well, that's thing one.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:00.680]   But thing two, here's the other problem, is that three to five years, rates of return
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.440]   are going to make very little difference.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.520]   So let's assume that you're going to buy-- I don't know where you live, Steve.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.480]   But let's assume that you're going to buy a $200,000 house.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.960]   And down here in Islet, where I live, West Palm Beach, that would be basically a starter
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:12.960]   house.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.320]   I mean, somewhere between $150,000 to $200,000 house.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.700]   And so my numbers make sense at $200,000.
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.720]   So let's say $200,000 house.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.000]   So let's assume you're going to put a 20% down payment.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.960]   You're going to finance 80% of it under a traditional fixed rate mortgage.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.160]   So in that 20%, you need to accumulate $40,000.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.360]   So let's assume-- let's use the calculator here real quick.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:40.080]   And let's say, OK, let's assume that $40,000 is our future value.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.080]   And let's put in-- let's say three years.
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.320]   Let's put in 36 months.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.120]   And let's start with nothing.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.920]   And let's say that we're going to use-- I don't know what CDs are today.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.680]   Let's say we're going to use a 2% investment return, 2% annualized.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:00.000]   Well, our monthly payment that we're going to need to save to accumulate that is $1,079.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   So we're going to save about $1,000 a month under a 2% investment return to equal the
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.220]   $36,000 that we want to save.
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:11.120]   So let's look at the impact of interest rates over a 36-month period.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.900]   So I'm going to change the math here.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.600]   And so now we're going to put in $1,000 for our payment.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.240]   We're going to put in 36 for our number of periods.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.400]   We're going to put in a 2% annualized interest rate.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.880]   And we're going to start with nothing.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:28.840]   So if we save at a 2% interest rate over a 36-month period, our total value that we have
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.580]   at the end of 36 months is $37,070.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:37.700]   And the reason that's not-- we're going to have $37,070.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.940]   So we've got $37,070.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:43.040]   Let's put in a 3% interest rate.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:49.320]   Now instead of $37,070, we've got $37,620.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.920]   So let's put in a 5% interest rate.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:55.320]   Let's say that you could find something over the next three years that were really going
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.880]   to make a big difference for you.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:05.640]   Well, in this world now, the difference between at 2% and at 5%, the 5% interest rate is $38,753.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:14.480]   So let's subtract 38,000-- from $38,753, let's subtract $37,070.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:22.360]   And our answer is $1,683 to go from 2% to 5% interest rate.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.920]   Now go out and look at the investment and savings options that are available for you
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.120]   over a 36-month period.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:33.360]   And you tell me how on earth you're going to go from 2% rate of return to 5% rate of
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.360]   return.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.240]   With any kind of guarantees in today's low-rate world.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.000]   I don't know of a strategy that's going to do it with any kind of guarantees.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.580]   And when you're talking about saving for a house, you need to look at the guarantees.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:54.380]   So over this period of time, the difference of 2% versus 5% is a grand total of $1,683.
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.560]   Now let's say that you're saving for a house.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.400]   Does 36 months versus 37-- what is that-- 37.6 months make a difference?
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.880]   36 versus 38 months to buy the house and have your money that you need to make up that extra
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.360]   $1,600?
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.360]   That makes no difference at all in your purchase plan.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.800]   But it makes all the difference in the world if you have the volatility associated with
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.400]   the 5% investment.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.600]   And all of a sudden now, you were expecting to have $40,000.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.960]   And your $40,000 dropped in price-- dropped in price because of some interest rate fluctuation--
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.120]   down to $28,000.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:29.760]   So over the short term, interest rates are almost irrelevant.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.840]   That $1,600 is completely irrelevant.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:36.440]   That's not even the cost-- when you're talking about buying a house, that's not even the
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.120]   cost of your inspection and your title insurance.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.880]   So you're better off just simply ignoring, in general, the interest rates completely
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:51.960]   and just ignore them and go about your life and save the money.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.540]   Now you do the best you can.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:56.320]   So toss that money in a money market fund.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.760]   Money market fund-- great.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.160]   That should work.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:04.280]   Now here's what can make the major difference.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.440]   What could you do with the money in the meantime that three to five years from now, when you're
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.000]   ready to buy a house, could make a much bigger difference for you?
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.120]   So I can't fix the problem of investment returns in three to five years.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.520]   I don't know an answer to it.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.120]   There's nothing that makes sense other than toss it in a savings account, and it doesn't
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.120]   make a difference.
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.720]   Oh, one more piece of math I wanted to do on that.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:25.280]   So let's keep exactly that same $1,000.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.720]   Let's go back to 2%.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.640]   So now I'm going to change our period from 36 months, and let's go ahead and change it
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.880]   to 360 months.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.440]   So we've got 360 months.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:39.200]   So I'm at 2% interest rate annualized, 360 months.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.480]   And let's start with nothing at present value, and let's put the same $1,000 a month into
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.760]   our account.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:50.880]   And let's say at $1,000 a month at 2%, then at the end of 30 years, investing $1,000 a
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:57.760]   month at 2%, we would have $492,725.39.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.360]   Now under this scenario, let me raise this to 5%.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.400]   So I'm going to raise my interest rate, no other changes to 5%.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.840]   Now at the end of-- from 2% to 5%.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:14.440]   Now at the end of 30 years, we've got $832,258.64.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:17.840]   Let's say that we raise this to 8%, just for numbers.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:25.400]   At 8%, $1,000 a month, we've got $1,490,359.45.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.520]   So if you want to understand why you hear every financial planner in the world say you
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.380]   can't keep your money in a bank account when you're investing for a 30-year period, it's
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.780]   because it costs you a million bucks to do so.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.320]   At 8%, it's $1,490,000.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.400]   At 2%, it's $492,000.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.860]   And think about the difference over a 30-year period of what having an extra million bucks
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:48.120]   to spend in your life as far as what you can actually spend that on.
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:52.040]   That makes a huge difference as far as your lifestyle.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:16:01.880]   Whereas the $1,600 difference for your house is only the difference of having to wait another
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.520]   1.6 months to buy your house.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:07.200]   You just started shopping at 1.6 months.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.080]   So that's the difference as far as that time horizon.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.480]   And once you understand that, you don't worry about making a big investment return on your
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.520]   house except for what I'm going to talk about in a second.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.440]   You just don't worry about that.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.840]   Now what could you actually do?
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.120]   I would say rethink the whole house decision.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:28.000]   Not rethinking in the meaning that Joshua recorded this show on buying a house as a
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.880]   bad investment and so therefore because I'm buying a house as a bad investment, then I
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.280]   should never buy a house and I should have to rent a house and now my wife's going to
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.280]   be upset with me.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.280]   Not in that way.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.940]   Although that is accurate if you want to think about it.
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:46.600]   But think about what could I do where I could exercise control over this money such that
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.880]   I can be in a really good shape to cover this house in three to five years.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.080]   So for example, do you have any money now?
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:57.200]   If you have some money, what could be the most productive thing to do with that money?
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.400]   Could you start a small business on the side where instead of saving $1,000 a month, you
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.160]   save for three months, you've got $3,000, you start a small business or some kind of
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.800]   side gig or something that you have expertise in.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:15.160]   And then because you control that, you take your $3,000 investment or your $300 investment
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:20.440]   and you grow that business to the point where instead of it, you can earn two, three, $4,000
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.440]   a month.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.880]   Well, that would be something that you could control.
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:27.520]   And so now you're in the position where instead of saving $1,000 a month for that house, now
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.760]   you're in the position where you have the $1,000 from your daytime job plus you have
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.360]   the $3,000 of profit from your nighttime job or the business that you started on the side.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.120]   And maybe it's a gamble and you might lose the money, but maybe it could pay off.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.960]   And when it pays off in the form of a business or a skill or something that you've done,
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.440]   then now you've got a situation where you can actually have a return that you can count
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.440]   on.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.920]   And even though it's a gamble, you can predict that return a little bit better.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.600]   Maybe you're in a situation where you're in the corporate world and you're working and
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.920]   you're making $60,000 a year.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:03.920]   And you say, "I've got $1,000 a month to save for a house, but in my job, I know that I
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.920]   need an MBA."
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.040]   Now, I don't know if you do your research on this because it varies, but in my job,
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.720]   I know that I need an MBA.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.240]   And if I had an MBA with my experience and if I had a better network, I could leave the
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:20.880]   company that I'm at and I could go from making $60,000 a year to making $160,000 a year because
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:27.040]   I built up a website, I built up a portfolio, I became a speaker and did these things.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.360]   Well, in that situation, I would say do that.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.860]   Make that $1,000 a month, go down, join the local Toastmasters Club, become a skilled
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:39.400]   public speaker, go start buying a book and reading a book a week off the personal MBA
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:44.080]   checklist, and go join an executive MBA program and spend your Saturdays in MBA school so
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.800]   that 12 months from now, you've got your MBA done.
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.580]   And then make sure that you're going to steal Brian Tracy's 1,000% formula.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:57.680]   Make sure that you're spending that $1,000 a month going to four conferences in your
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.920]   industry every year.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:03.480]   And take your wife with you, and you said young couple, so take your wife with you to
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:08.120]   those conferences, schedule your vacation around the conference, and go to the Widget
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.840]   Industry Conference in Denver and spend two days before that up in the mountains and two
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.340]   days after hanging out in Denver with the Denver people.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.560]   Things like that can actually make a difference.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:23.640]   Now fast forward three years, you've done what you needed to do to build your career.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.920]   Now in that situation, take yourself and go from $60,000 to $160,000.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:32.680]   And I've got an extra $100,000 of income that I can play with.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.680]   Guess what?
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:40.480]   If you'll keep your lifestyle and expenses at the $60,000 level, $100,000 of extra income,
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:45.560]   let's assume you're bad at tax planning, so you've got to pay $20,000 of that out in taxes.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.520]   So let's now say you've got $80,000.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:52.920]   Now you've got an extra $6,667 a month that you can save.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:58.020]   Well $6,667 a month over the next 12 months, that's $80,000.
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:02.880]   In another six months, there's your $40,000 we were trying to get to for your house down
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.480]   payment.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.020]   So that's how I would think about it.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:09.880]   There is no good investment strategy over a three to five year period that's going to
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.600]   work as far as helping you save the money.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.700]   But if you could come up with some kind of alternative strategy, maybe another strategy
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:20.040]   that comes to me is maybe instead of buying a single family house, you guys could buy
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:23.960]   a quadruplex or a duplex or something like this.
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.040]   Well now you go in, you find a good price, you get involved in real estate investment,
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:31.280]   you buy a quad, and you've got to come up with a higher down payment.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.240]   So maybe you can build a relationship with a local real estate investor.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.760]   Maybe that person can be a hard money lender.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.200]   You can build a relationship with a hard money lender or someone that will help you out.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.480]   And you can make the numbers work where for the same price that you're paying today in
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.920]   rent with the fact that you borrowed the money from a hard money lender or from a local real
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:50.120]   estate investor who wanted to be available and you split the deal with them and set up
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:53.640]   something where you're living in one of these four units.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.040]   And then over a five year period, you can live in that unit and then you can manage
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.480]   the quad, the quadruplex.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:03.920]   And over that five year period, you can build up the cash flow from that to where you buy
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.280]   out the fellow investor.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.600]   He gets his money back with a good rate of return.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.840]   You've got a place to live for the next three to five years.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.320]   And then in three to five years, maybe you can make the cash flow numbers work where
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.240]   in excess you've got an amount, in excess of the mortgage payment on the investment
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:22.000]   property, in excess of that mortgage payment, you've got the money coming in where you can
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.760]   then turn it and cover your own mortgage payment and have less money that you need to cover
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.760]   that.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.760]   Now, is that possible?
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.760]   I bet you it is.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.760]   Is it easy?
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:32.760]   Probably not.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.760]   I don't know if those numbers would work.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.560]   I'm making the idea up off the top of my head.
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:39.720]   But something like that is where I would spend my time focusing.
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:45.640]   Building your skills, building your knowledge, figuring out an alternative angle.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.280]   Now, last part to it.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.880]   Is there anything wrong if you have a job that you like and you live in a place that
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.000]   you like and you're saving the money and you're really happy with your lifestyle and you don't
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.320]   want to work on the side and you don't want to go to four stupid conferences a year and
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.840]   you don't want to go on Saturday and waste your Saturday on an MBA program and you just
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:07.960]   want to save a thousand bucks a month for the next 36 months to have your $38,000, $40,000
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:08.960]   down payment?
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:09.960]   Is there anything wrong with that?
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.120]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.160]   There's no inherent virtue in having more money.
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:17.200]   It's just that people, if you're listening to a finance show, this is how my ideas work
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.800]   to try to figure out what works and what doesn't work.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.760]   So those are my thoughts for you, Steve.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.760]   Good question.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760]   Let me know what you think.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.880]   I'd love to know if this advice helps you at all.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:31.800]   I want to real quick, Robbie Courtney sent me that tweet and I covered it on Wednesday,
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.640]   but it was kind of a different kind of show.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.360]   What financial advice would you have given your 18-year-old self?
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.120]   Here's the short and sweet answer.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:41.560]   On Wednesday, I was just thinking through some of the lessons that I've learned that
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:46.600]   I think affect more finances than just what financial advice would I do.
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:50.760]   But my answer to that question is invest in yourself and in your ideas first and then
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:55.520]   look for a strategy that's going to work faster than any kind of specific market thing.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:59.240]   If you're interested in investments, go out and get interested in it and spend all your
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:03.000]   time trading stocks or buying and selling investments.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.760]   But you can do that, but you're going to be a different kind of person.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:08.840]   You're going to be the kind of person who's obsessed with this stuff and for whom it's
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.900]   fun to sit and read annual reports.
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:13.440]   The best example I give you of that is Joshua Kennan.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.360]   I'd love to interview him at some point.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.840]   If anybody knows him, please ask him for an interview.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.320]   I'm going to send him a note.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:22.920]   I don't know if he does interviews, but he's one of my favorite financial writers.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:27.120]   He writes the About Investing section for the About website.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.120]   He does a great job.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:32.320]   He's got a personal website at JoshuaKennan.com.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:38.280]   But the interesting thing you'll find is that you'll see kind of a very open peek into the
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:45.080]   mind of how actual investors think.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.480]   For him, his favorite thing to do is sit down with a stack of annual reports and a highlighter
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.040]   and read through annual reports.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.480]   That's not the average person.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:55.520]   So he gets above average investment returns and he has an above average lifestyle because
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.760]   that's his fun.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:01.040]   And so you're likely to find him at 2 a.m. reading investment reports.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.340]   But if that's you, go for it.
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:06.200]   Number two, invest in yourself and in your ideas first.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.960]   So knowledge, skills, focus on that.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.180]   Focus on your knowledge and your skills.
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.160]   We know this intuitively with college.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.080]   Everyone says go to college so you can make more money.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.160]   But what's the philosophy behind that?
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.040]   It's not as simple as saying I got a college degree so I make more money.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.720]   There's tons of college people out there making minimum wage.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.320]   But the idea is skills.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:28.360]   And so traditional people would say, well, a college degree grants you skills.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.640]   You need to develop some kind of skills that will create your income.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.720]   Because at the beginning of your life, you have unlimited human capital.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:36.720]   Not unlimited.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.360]   You have the most human capital you're ever going to have and you have no financial capital.
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:44.440]   So you've got to enhance the human capital with the financial capital until the human
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:49.240]   capital is so valuable that you can then transform it into financial capital and use the financial
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.300]   capital to pay for everything else.
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:55.400]   But the connection between financial capital and human capital is so important.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.560]   So spend the money going to the places, the classes you need to go.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:01.920]   Spend the money gaining the skills that you need to gain.
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.040]   Look for a way to find money that you don't have to have.
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.180]   So look for a way to leverage something.
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:13.040]   So look for a way to leverage your skills and other people's money.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.720]   Whether that's starting a business with investors' money or borrowed money or no money because
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.020]   you have skills and you can bootstrap the thing.
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:22.560]   Look for a way to develop artificial equity.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.040]   So for example, maybe you don't have the money to go out and buy a real estate portfolio,
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.760]   but you're really invested in real estate.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.280]   So you would become a property manager and you would then leverage somebody else's investment,
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:37.320]   somebody else's money to then allow you to learn the skills that you need to do while
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:39.640]   you're then saving money so that you can become your own investor.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.800]   So now you're leveraging someone else's money.
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.280]   This is what financial advisors do.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.400]   So a financial advisor who's managing assets.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   I wasn't a millionaire.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.480]   I'm not a millionaire.
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:50.620]   I wasn't a millionaire when I'm managing a million dollar portfolio.
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:55.780]   So I'm essentially using the million dollar portfolio to provide for my income.
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:59.760]   And so that's what, so I can leverage my love and my skills with financial planning and
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.840]   portfolios and financial advice.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.600]   I could leverage that using other people's money.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.600]   And so I can kind of develop an artificial equity.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.840]   And that would send my friend Jim Collins crazy because he would say, "Joshua, that's
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.840]   crazy.
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:13.840]   That's unethical."
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.840]   We'll talk about it sometime, Jim, if you're listening.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840]   I hope you are.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:21.480]   But you could do that in any kind of business and there's a lot of options for that.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:24.080]   Look for a strategy that will work faster.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.920]   So don't look at the, "Okay, I'm going to buy a hundred."
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:31.880]   I spent years lost in these books of, "Save $100 a month and then at 10% you'll be a millionaire
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:32.880]   in the future."
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.680]   You've got to focus on building a financially valuable skill.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:39.760]   Then you've got to focus on investing that with some kind of extreme option while you
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.320]   have the time and flexibility.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.600]   Follow Money Mustache's strategy of get financially independent by the time you're 30.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.360]   Work your tail off, live like a college student from 18 to 30, and then you'll be a millionaire
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.000]   and then you can live like a millionaire the rest of your life because you've built these
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.120]   skills up.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.880]   Follow that strategy or follow the strategy where you lay it all on the line and build
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.240]   a business.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.040]   There are so many alternative strategies.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:07.840]   Look for a strategy that's going to work faster, that's also going to apply to your goals.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:14.780]   There's nothing wrong with going the traditional route if that's what you're into.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:18.960]   That would be my short, again, answer to Robbie.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:19.960]   Last question.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.640]   Sorry, two more quick questions.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:29.240]   Miriam, screen name or Twitter name, Moipmto, so Miriam Ortiz Epino writes a question.
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.840]   What is the most complicated thing in your day?
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.920]   Frankly, it was last week.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:38.360]   It was trying to figure out how to get my Skype thing to work with my bad computer connection,
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:39.480]   but I think I might have fixed that.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.480]   I'm still trying to get another solution that'll work better.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:45.200]   But the most complicated thing in my day is trying to figure out how on earth do you take
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.960]   this complicated stuff and make it simple.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.440]   I struggle with it because I feel it's one of my skills, but it's an underdeveloped skill,
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:58.960]   which is why I'm doing the podcast, is I want to try to figure out how do I take these complex
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:04.080]   things like investments and portfolio management and complex topics and make them simple.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.840]   I think this has probably made one of the biggest differences.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:10.640]   I made fun of Warren Buffett earlier, as people consider him to be the god of investing.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.680]   But the thing that he is so good at, which is amazing, is he takes a complex concept
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:22.880]   and he boils it down into this very pithy, kind of down-home aphorism.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.960]   And so he's viewed as a lovable Uncle Warren.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.840]   And the wisdom in this little aphorism is so great.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.400]   I would really want to develop that.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.520]   So I think a lot about how can I do that.
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:35.320]   And I want to develop that with the podcast going forward.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.120]   Last thought from Wolfgang.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:44.120]   And his Twitter handle here is @WMThoughts on Twitter.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.920]   So Wolfgang says, since you probably read all good finance books, any thoughts on the
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.600]   ideas in the millionaire fast lane?
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:54.240]   And I flipped through the millionaire fast lane a couple of years ago.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:29:00.040]   And from memory, I think it was basically the idea is avoid the slow lane and get to
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040]   the fast lane.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:05.640]   And basically, look for how to become wealthy faster than what you're originally told.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.800]   I just went and bought the Kindle version.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:12.640]   And so Wolfgang, I will read it again and do a comment on it.
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.160]   I'll do a book review on it.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:15.920]   And I'd love to interview him.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.240]   I think from my memory, I really liked what he had to say.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.000]   And it lines up with my own experience.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.200]   If I'm remembering the book correctly, he talked a lot in the book about the idea of
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.680]   build out a business, build out something that's actually going to make you money a
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:37.960]   lot faster than the idea of work a job you hate for 40 years.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.240]   And this is kind of the common theme.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:42.560]   And there's lots of ways to solve this nut.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.560]   So we'll see.
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.560]   I will read it again.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.680]   I really think I liked it.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:48.820]   And I've seen other people make really positive reviews on it.
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.420]   So I will check it out.
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:51.420]   And I will read it.
[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:52.420]   And I will report back.
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:53.420]   And I will do a comment on it.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:54.420]   And I'll do a comment on it.
