[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.260]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 18.
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:44.400]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today, Friday, July 11, 2014. Today's show
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.560]   is going to be a question and answer show. And today we're going to talk about how do you protect
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.240]   yourself? How do you protect yourself from the bad things that are going to happen to you? And
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.580]   in a bear market, we're going to talk again about what financial advice would you like to
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.260]   have at 18 years old? What would be the best investment strategy for a young couple looking
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.140]   to buy a house in the next three to five years? And what's the most complicated thing in my day?
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.620]   And then my thoughts on the book, The Millionaire Fastlane. Stay with us.
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:20.220]   So I've been looking forward to this.
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.300]   This is fun. I like doing Q&A. And as we start to get some good traction online, and we start to get
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.120]   some more and more and more and more of you listening, which I really appreciate. And I
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.600]   thank you for those of you who are listening. I am excited about doing these Q&A shows because to me,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.740]   you know, I can sit back and I do sit back and try to think, well, what are the things that I
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.860]   think are the most relevant or the most useful for people to know and understand? But really,
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.580]   it helps me a lot if you just simply tell me. Tell me what you want to know and what you want
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.200]   to understand. And I think that's going to be a really, really important part of this. And I think
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.220]   that's going to be a really, really important part of this. And I think that's going to be a really, really
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.300]   important part of this. And I think that's going to be a really, really important part of this.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.200]   And so this past week, we've been engaging with you guys on Twitter and asking for your questions,
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.480]   which, by the way, if you'd like to follow us on Twitter, the Twitter handle for the show is
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.540]   RadicalPF. So just go on Twitter and search RadicalPF, and you will find us. And I'd love
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.020]   to engage with you there. And I'd love to have a conversation, help out any way that I can.
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.160]   And so we're going to cover these, what is that, four questions, five questions that I received
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.120]   from the audience. I'm going to recover, but very briefly this time. One of the questions that I did
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.060]   the whole show on on Wednesday, because I got some additional ideas and I'd like to do a little
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.360]   bit better job with it. So we're going to be covering those questions. And then I hope to
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.640]   make this a regular Friday event, where basically on Fridays, I answer your questions. And I do my
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.740]   best to be specific and direct and give you some ways, some things to think about. And, you know,
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.500]   my biggest frustration back when I was a practicing financial advisor is that it always frustrates me
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.480]   that it seems like people don't go to professionals for financial advice. Now, I understand there's a
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   lot of distrust of financial advisors. If you actually look at the at the statistics in the
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.060]   and the the industry statistics, it seems that financial advisors have a lower trust rating
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:11.340]   than do car dealers, used car dealers. And, you know, we I always feel I always felt bad for car
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.760]   dealers, because, well, actually, I could always empathize with car dealers, because
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.500]   it seems like, you know, they're the brunt of a lot of jokes. But yet, you know, I was a life
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.780]   insurance salesperson. And that's the brunt of a lot of jokes. And if an angel advisor, you're the
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.900]   brunt of a lot of jokes there. So it's good. Those jokes are probably good, though, because hopefully
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.100]   they keep they keep us honest, and they keep our industry honest, and they keep us getting better
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.200]   each and every day, trying to to improve, improve our reputation. Now, obviously, there's a lot of
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.120]   a lot of people that deserve that bad reputation. And there are a few of us that really try to,
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.480]   to develop a good reputation. So what I'd like to do is I'd like to give you access to me, you know,
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.680]   I'm a certified financial planner, I've got a bunch of technical knowledge, hopefully,
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.920]   you start to like some of the ways that I think about things in the way the ways that I talk about
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.680]   things. And the reason that I'd like to provide this as a service is because people don't take
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.120]   me up on it. I always used to joke with my clients and say, Listen, anytime not joke, I used to tell
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.440]   my clients, anytime you ever have a financial decision, call me and just talk to me about it.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.800]   I'm here, I'm not going to charge you for the phone call, just call me and talk to me about it.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.220]   Because what I see over and over, and this is the joke, is that usually people ask the wrong people
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.660]   for advice. The example that I always go to is, let's say that you take on a new job, and you're
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.540]   sitting there and, and human resources comes in with this giant stack of papers, and they toss it
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:42.300]   on the desk, and it goes right on the desk. And there is a big, big stack of papers there, and you
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.400]   pick it up, and you kind of scratch your head and say,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.940]   I don't understand these words. So usually, here's what most people do, they kind of lean back in the
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.860]   chair. And they asked the broke guy next to them. And they say, Hey, Joe, you know, listen, what did
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.500]   you put down on these papers? And I'm saying, why on earth are you asking the broke guy in the
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.920]   cubicle next to you for financial advice, pick up the phone and call a financial advisor. And even
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.640]   if that person charges you, let's say they charge you 50 bucks for a for a 20 minute conversation.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.380]   That'd probably be a better idea than than asking the broke guy in the cubicle next to you for
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.580]   financial advice. So but the problem is, people aren't accustomed to calling financial advisors,
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.740]   they're not accustomed to talking with financial planners. And so what I'd like to do is give you
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.040]   access to just mainly how a financial planner would think, which is how I'm going to handle
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.580]   these shows. Now, unfortunately, there's this little problem, there's a little problem that
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.880]   in the United States, giving financial advice is heavily regulated, and probably rightly so.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.360]   So what that means is I can never give personal financial advice. That's a reason for the
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   should do. But I actually don't think that's the most important thing. Number one, I can't know who
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.700]   you are and what you are looking for in a Twitter comment. So I can't in 140 characters figure out
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:02.500]   what your life story is. But my hope is to send you back and cause you and encourage you to go
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.020]   and find somebody that you can trust and go and find your individual financial planner, your
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.440]   advisor, your most trusted financial person, whoever that is, whether that's an accountant,
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.480]   an attorney, a trusted friend or business associate, an insurance agent, a financial
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.860]   advisor, whatever that is. I want to encourage you to go back to that person because that's the
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:30.160]   person who can really understand what your situation is. But what I believe I can do and
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.560]   what I want to do with these questions is tell you how I would think about it, is talk to you
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.280]   about some of the different ways that I would approach the problem. And if I can successfully
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.420]   do that, then I'm going to be able to get you to go back and find somebody that you
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.640]   can trust and give you some ideas on how I would approach the problems. Then my hope is it'll kind
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.400]   of stir up your creative juices. And then if you're a do-it-yourselfer, all the information's
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.720]   out there for free. Go down to the library, go online, be careful online because it's a lot
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.860]   easier for somebody to write a forum post and you think it's really good. In reality, it's not.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.600]   Generally, you don't have a lot of posers writing in-depth technical financial planning textbooks. So
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.140]   you might be better off going down to the library and reading some books where there's a higher
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.400]   investment on the
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.700]   behalf of the author than just going based upon a forum post. But still, if you're a do-it-yourselfer,
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.180]   fine. Hopefully this information will give you help. If not, hopefully it'll give you some
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:26.660]   encouragement and motivation to seek out an advisor that you trust and have a conversation
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.380]   with them and see if they'll be able to help you out. I really hope they could. This is one of my,
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.780]   I guess it's not secret, but this is part of my agenda for the show, is that I always never
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.380]   understood why don't people talk to financial advisors more? I mean, I used to think, I'm
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.980]   a good guy, you know, and I understand the distress. I've talked with lots of people about it. But
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.540]   hopefully it will help a little bit and hopefully it will arm you with information so that you can
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.280]   smoke the good ones out from the bad ones and you can understand and you can be a better educated
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:00.780]   consumer. I hope this helps you. So a couple of quick announcements before we get going. First of
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.280]   all, I did get some of my technology issues worked out. So I am able to do some interviews. So
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:12.220]   hopefully you enjoyed the interview yesterday on not paying your taxes because of as a tax war tax
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:12.360]   relationship. So I'm going to talk a little bit about that. So I'm going to talk a little bit about
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.640]   resistance movement. I certainly did. It's a subject that I've never heard discussed on a
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.460]   financial show. And my advice is still going to be to pay your taxes because that's the proper
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.400]   advice. However, I would encourage you to kind of research and consider what your conscience would
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.920]   say. And I would admire you if you decided that you needed to follow in the path of David Gross,
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:42.340]   who we talked to yesterday. I have, it's a thought provoking topic. And I enjoyed the
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.960]   interview as well because again, I often in the past would say, well, these people are crazy,
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.700]   but I tell you, David sure isn't crazy or he sure didn't sound crazy. And when you read his thoughts
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.500]   and you read, and especially if you read his book and see the research, I had no idea about the
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.920]   history of tax resistance and the impact that it's made in places where it really, really was needed
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.700]   and had a big impact. So this next week, I've got two interviews lined up. I'm going to be
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.320]   interviewing Jake DeSillas from the show, the podcast and website called The Voluntary Life,
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.060]   I've enjoyed Jake's podcast for a couple of years, and he's just a really neat guy. He's from the UK.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:24.000]   He's an entrepreneur. He's just written a book on entrepreneurship. And I haven't read that book
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.700]   yet. I plan to read it over the weekend here before, before I speak with him to try to be
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:34.220]   able to do a better interview with him. But I have certainly enjoyed his content and he's very
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.460]   soft spoken. He's very gentle on his, on his podcast. And I would commend his podcast to you.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.200]   And if you're interested in some of these topics of, of financial literacy,
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:49.840]   and financial philosophy, as it interacts with things like, with things like political philosophy,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.900]   then I encourage you to check out his show, The Voluntary Life. If you have questions that,
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.720]   if you've listened to his show, or you have questions for him after maybe reviewing his
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.640]   content over the weekend, let me know those questions, those questions, either on Twitter
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.980]   or via email. And I will be interviewing him next week. Also going to be interviewing
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.280]   Jacob Lund Fisker from the Early Retirement Extreme. I reviewed Jacob's book,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:18.060]   Early Retirement Extreme, and I love that book. And I highly commend it to you. I did a lengthy
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.600]   book review where I wound up just reading more from the book and saying it's awesome a lot
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:29.900]   rather than actually any keen and cutting insight. But I really enjoyed Jacob's, Jacob's book. And so
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:35.840]   I would encourage you if you have questions for Jacob, he is not so much in the public eye these
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.220]   days, but I've, I've, I think I've sweet talked him into doing an interview with me. I'm pretty
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.260]   excited about it. So if you have questions that you'd like to ask Jacob, I'd love to hear from
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.240]   you. If you have questions that you would like me to ask him, please ask me those questions as well.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.540]   And I'll make sure to include them if I'm able to on, uh, again, ask me on Twitter or send me an
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:55.280]   email at joshuaatradicalpersonalfinance.com, joshuaatradicalpersonalfinance.com or on Twitter
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.740]   at Radical PF. Also just a reminder, if you're enjoying the content, come by the blog and sign
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:06.220]   up for the email list. I don't, uh, I just a quick note on the email list, and I'm sure I'll repeat
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.480]   this throughout the course of the show. Uh, the email list is designed to give you information
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.240]   on what the show is about. So you can decide what you want to do with it. And if you have
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:42.220]   a question, please let me know. I'm going to be happy to answer that. And if you have a question,
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.220]   you're interested in not. And then on Wednesday next week, I'm planning to do an in-depth show
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.860]   on some of the fundamentals of stocks and bonds, trying to continue with the teaching shows
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.100]   and talk through some of the fundamentals to give you a way to think about it. When you hear the
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.360]   word stocks, uh, to give you a way to think about what that means. Uh, right now in today's show,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.380]   we're going to be talking. The first question I'm going to look at is what steps would you
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.860]   take to protect your investments in a bear market? And I'm going to give a detailed answer to that
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.200]   question, but I may be throwing terminology at you. You're not familiar with it. I'm going to
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.240]   start with, it's all going to build over time and it's going to build starting with a proper
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.440]   understanding of what are stocks and bonds. So look for that on Wednesday and then look for the
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.840]   Q and a show next Friday. Hopefully I'll get these interviews run on Tuesday and Thursday.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.000]   And then Monday, I haven't decided the content yet. I may do a, uh, another teaching show,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.200]   or I may do something else, talk about current events or something like that. We'll see. So
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.940]   we'll see how that goes. So first question here, this comes from, this one came in on Twitter and
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.060]   I'm going to ask you to answer it. So the question is a good one. Uh, the Twitter handle here is at
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:51.620]   moto Jones. And so moto, thank you for the question. And the, and the question here is
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.380]   what steps would you take to protect your investments in a bear market? And when would
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:03.100]   you put them in place? And so I'm going to answer this specifically, but it's going to be a big
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.880]   answer. And there are a few, there are a few, there are a few ways to answer the question.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.020]   And I'm, and moto, I apologize to you in advance. It's not a simple answer,
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.180]   but it is one of the most complicated questions that you could possibly answer.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:23.340]   So my short answer to the question is, has three parts. What step would I take to protect my
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.620]   investment in a bear market? I would, so the first answer is I would take whatever steps
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:32.440]   my strategy indicated that I should take to protect my investments in a bear market.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.900]   The second answer is nothing. I wouldn't take any steps to protect my investments in a bear market.
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.140]   And the third answer, as far as when I would put them in place, I would put them in place before
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.660]   investing any money. And so let me give you the answer and let me expand on those things. So they
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.800]   just don't sound like crazy talk. And I tried to touch on this this last week when talking about
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.780]   markets and, and the reaction to on Monday, Monday show, when talking about Dow 17,000.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.740]   And when I came away from that show, I realized I really struggled to communicate this clearly,
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:08.820]   but the point that I was trying to get across was that there's no one strategy that works
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.120]   and actually figuring out, you know, what should you do? When should you do this? And so I'm going
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.240]   to start off by saying, you know, when the bear market comes, which I understand you're asking it
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.500]   in advance, but what most people say is, well, what should I do? I think there's a bear market.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:23.540]   What should I do? And you've got to understand your strategy long before the bear market ever
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:28.020]   comes. It's completely the wrong question to ask. And you need to incorporate into your strategy,
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:34.960]   what are you going to do in a bear market? And, you know, markets are, seem at times incredibly
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:42.100]   logical and rational and seem the rest of the time, you know, completely schizophrenic. I can't
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:48.540]   saying on it. It was something about, I forget his quote, but the market is crazy. One day is
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.720]   totally sane and the next day is totally rational. I should look up that quote and memorize it. But
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.500]   the only way to survive in a bear market or a bull market is to understand your strategy and
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:03.140]   know what you're going to do. And so there are very few strategies that I know of that should
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.820]   be changed in a bear market. Now, you do have to have a strategy for the bear market, but there
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.220]   are very few strategies that should be changed when you're in a bear market. And here's where
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.940]   you've got to understand what your actual investment strategy is and all of the research
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:25.560]   and the history and the planning behind it. And so when you study markets and you study,
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.900]   you get a little bit more sophisticated and you start looking at portfolio management.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.080]   And my caveat, I am not a portfolio manager. I'm not that interested in it. I'm interested in
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.700]   studying it. I'm not interested in doing it. I'd love to have some great portfolio managers on it
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.800]   sometime, but I-
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.720]   I know enough to really admire it and to understand kind of the theory behind it. But the
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   actual practicing of it, it's not my deal. But the key is you can make tons of money in a bear
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:55.020]   market. Tons of money in a bear market. You can make just as much money in a bear market as you
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:16:00.120]   can in a bull market. And maybe you can make more. And you can lose your shirt in a bear market and
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:08.780]   in a bull market. It's not these phrases, what is a bear market or what is a bull market. In
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:38.760]   a bull market, you can make as much money as you can in a bull market. And you can lose your shirt in a
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:17:08.740]   bull market. And you can lose your shirt in a bull market. And you can lose your shirt in a
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:38.720]   bull market. And you can lose your shirt in a bull market. And you can lose your shirt in a bull market.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:18:08.700]   And you can lose your shirt in a bull market. And you can lose your shirt in a bull market. And you can
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.360]   financial literati, oh, I'll coin something one of these days. But in the online world,
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.240]   it's basically accepted as gospel that the only approach to investing that works, and it's the
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.920]   best, and it's the best thing that everyone should do with their money, is to use passive index funds
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.640]   as the basis for your investments. And I don't agree, I don't disagree, I'm not going to comment
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.840]   on that today. But let's just start with passive investing. So passive index investing. So the
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:38.800]   fundamental premise behind passive index investing is this is built on the efficient market
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:45.460]   hypothesis. This is built on the idea that markets are absolutely efficient, and that it's impossible
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:53.200]   for you to find any way to do better than another person based upon research. And even if it is
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.760]   possible to find a little bit, it's not possible for you to do it for less cost. So most people
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.800]   who are really involved in passive investing, and in the concept of index,
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.860]   would say, well, we wouldn't necessarily, many people, I should steer away from most because I have
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.780]   absolutely no statistics to back this up. It's just an impression that I've gotten from research.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:17.840]   So many people would say, well, you know, we wouldn't necessarily say that an active manager
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:27.260]   can't outperform a passive portfolio. But we would say that an active manager can't outperform a
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.740]   passive portfolio and cover the costs. So we'll just strip out all the costs of the active manager,
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.720]   and we'll do good enough.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.240]   And we'll just take the average return to the market, and we'll try to just own the market.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.220]   All right. So this strategy, it works. I don't see any reason why it can't work, why it won't work,
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:46.460]   why it doesn't work. Most of the academic literature would say that this works. But
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:52.640]   the key here is that the premise is that the market is always right. And so if you have a bull market,
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.020]   the market is right. And if you have a bear market, the market is right.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.080]   And so the key is you've got to stick with the market.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.660]   And you've got to be...
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.440]   You've got to be committed under this strategy to never adjusting
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:12.560]   based upon the bulls or the bears. Now, we'll talk in a moment about derivatives. So you could say,
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.960]   well, I'm going to use something like an exchange-traded fund, and I'm going to make my own
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:23.100]   bet on the market. So if this were your strategy, and this were your trading strategy, then you
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:31.120]   could say, I'm going to use an ETF, a total market ETF. I'm going to short that because I think the
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.640]   market is going to go down. And that's what I'm going to do. So I'm going to use an exchange-traded
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.360]   fund. And I'm going to use an ETF. And I'm going to use an exchange-traded fund. And I'm going to use an
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:34.860]   ETF. And I'm going to use an ETF. And I'm going to use an ETF. And I'm going to use an ETF. And I'm going to use an ETF.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:40.100]   So we'll get to trading in a moment. But passive investing, you just simply accept the market is
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:45.620]   right. The market is the consensus. The market price of stocks of these companies that we're
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.800]   trading is the consensus of all of the people involved, and they are correct. So therefore,
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.900]   if the market price is down, the market price is down. That gives me an opportunity to buy more.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.540]   The market price is up. That's great because the money is going up. But I'm just going to simply
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.460]   go on faith that this is always the correct price. And I'm going to...
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.000]   I'm going to put my money in over time. And I'm going to depend on economic growth
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.680]   to drive my returns. So the economic growth of the companies, because I know if the managers
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.900]   of the companies can't produce economic growth, the board of directors will fire them,
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.560]   and they will hire a new set of managers. That's the philosophy behind passive investing.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.620]   So if that is your philosophy, there's no room in that philosophy or in that trading strategy
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:32.240]   for saying, I'm going to get out because there's a bear market. But yet, most people,
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.680]   many people do. So they say, well, I know where the bear market is. Problem is, is that you probably
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:43.000]   can't know. But being right when a bear market is coming requires you to be right twice. You got to
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.360]   be right going down. So you got to say, OK, the market's going to go down, and I'm going to get
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:51.620]   out. And then you got to be right going in again as far as when to get in again. And it is incredibly
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:58.140]   difficult to be right twice because there's so many factors at play. Now, at the end of the day,
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.480]   that's your prerogative. If you want to trade your portfolio like that, that's totally fine if you
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.860]   can be right. I've had those ideas myself. I've had those hunches. But if you think that you can,
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:13.280]   that's fine. But recognize that it requires you to be right twice. And this is the big one that
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.180]   I've observed in the financial press over the last, what, five years since 2008, six years since 2008.
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.100]   Many people would say, well, look, I'm right on getting out. Look, I see the decline coming.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:27.620]   But when did you tell people to get back in? Because in one way, it's really easy to see
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:32.020]   bad news. It's in other ways, it's really easy to not know when it's really tough.
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.940]   To know, okay, the bad news is over and I'm ready to get back in. And so I just leave that for you
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.060]   to think about. You consider what you want to do. There are various strategies where the people will
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:46.440]   say, listen, I know this and I can do this. But this idea that I'm just going to own an index fund
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.440]   in my 401k and every, you know, in one month I'm going to get in and 11 months I'm going to get out,
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:57.080]   I've never seen any proven research to show that that would be correct. So that would be passive
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.740]   investing. And that's how I'd answer the question is, if you understand the strategy, unless your
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.960]   strategy incorporates a trading strategy or an insurance strategy, which we're going to go to
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.640]   in a moment, then in general, you just got to commit to yourself, I'm going to sit tight and
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.440]   I'm going to enjoy the ride. And I'm going to do something else, which we'll talk about that
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.860]   something else in a moment is how to protect yourself because this is where the real key is.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:22.980]   We're going to do something else to make sure that I'm protected in the mutual fund.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.920]   And that's something else just to whet your appetite. That something else is financial
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.660]   planning, not portfolio management, meaning that you're not going to be relying on these
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:38.000]   assets in a time of a bear, some in a time of a bear market. So number two, let's go on to
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.620]   active funds. So in an active mutual fund strategy, and let's stick for a moment with
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.920]   stock mutual funds. In an active mutual fund strategy, here you have a portfolio manager,
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.600]   which is actually a large team of managers working together, although there is one person
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.260]   who is in charge and has the full responsibility for the portfolio. And this team would be a team
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.480]   of researchers, a team of traders, a team of strategists, and basically, you know,
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:07.100]   the manager is bringing it all together. So these funds could work. Okay, but if you own these funds,
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.100]   you're not going to be adjusting in a bear market, or at least you shouldn't be adjusting and
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:16.640]   adjusting in a bear market, because you are choosing a philosophy and you're going in and
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:22.560]   you're buying those funds. So read your prospectus and understand what is my manager doing for me?
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.700]   Why am I paying him the $15 million a year that he's earning? Why am I actually doing this?
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.460]   And understand it. And don't, don't, you don't make the,
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.580]   the change because of the bear market. So this is like, if you're telling your manager,
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:43.460]   okay, manager, I want you to be looking for value stocks. And let's say that you're using a value,
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:49.740]   a value fund. And so on this, on this, in this type of strategy, you're using a value stock fund,
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:56.000]   your manager has the charge to go out and shop for bargains, looking for companies that have low,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.360]   you know, low, low, low earning multiples and high dividend yields. And so they're out trying
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.440]   to find bargains. And they're out trying to find bargains. And they're out trying to find bargains.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.580]   They're trying to say, I think that this company's stock price is down because of this,
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.440]   these factors that are going out. And I think they're going to rebound either because
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.480]   the economic environment is going to get better because we've got new management or because we've
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:20.800]   got new prod products or things like that. And so these managers are going out and trying to find
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.480]   companies that they can buy at a value. Well, when are they likely the most likely to find
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.880]   companies that they can buy at a value in a bad market, right? In a, in a, in a declining price
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.420]   market, which is a bad market. And so they're out trying to find companies that they can buy at a
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.260]   bear market is. So if all of a sudden you are, you're pulling your money out of an active mutual
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:42.060]   fund and you're owning value, um, stock mutual funds within that portfolio and you're pulling
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:47.000]   your money out, what does the manager have to do? They have to, they have to sell, they have to sell
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.020]   investments to raise cash so that you can redeem your shares in the mutual fund. That's what
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:56.140]   happens. That's how it's done. When you buy an investment in a mutual fund, that cash flows into
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:01.200]   the mutual fund managers portfolio. The manager then uses that cash to buy investments. When you
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.140]   redeem shares in a mutual fund, then the mutual fund manager has to sell investments, raise the
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:12.040]   cash to pay you your redemption fees. And this is one of the downsides of mutual funds is that you
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:18.900]   have these times of euphoria and, and depression in the market swings. And so this really causes
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:23.900]   mutual fund portfolio managers a real challenge because they've got to keep enough cash on hand
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:29.200]   to, they've got to keep enough cash on hand to allow you to redeem your shares when you sell
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.920]   your, when you sell your investments.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.800]   So this is a real challenge. If you're managing a portfolio, you've got to figure out how much
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.920]   cash do I keep around? And maybe your best investment ideas aren't going to pay off
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.840]   for a year because you see the company, but you've got all of a sudden, because the prices
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:50.060]   are going down, you've got all of a sudden sell the portfolio out. So, so if you're using actively
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:55.140]   managed mutual funds, you've got to be committed to staying the course. When I was managing,
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:01.020]   well, technically it's called managing investment portfolios, but I always called it managing
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.520]   investor behavior and that my job was to be the go-between to set, to talk the investors off the
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:11.020]   ledge. Because if we're going to trust this strategy, then that means we've got to trust
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:17.820]   this strategy. We've got to trust this manager all the way through and not respond to panic and
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.680]   not respond to euphoric greed. If we're not going to stay the course in that situation,
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.900]   we should never start. If we can't handle the ups and downs and the volatility of owning this
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.340]   company or owning this, this, this, this portfolio, this manager, we should never start.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:39.980]   And so my job, what I saw as a financial advisor was largely to help man investors manage their
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.620]   emotions and help them try to help predict a little bit. Hey, we're going to, here's what
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:49.120]   the emotions you're going to face, because if you're warned about those things, then you're
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.860]   warned about those things. Then, you know, in advance, okay, here's what I'm going to, here's
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:28:01.100]   what I'm going to face. So now that would be a good example. And so in this, in this world,
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:05.140]   because this is most of it, most investments still currently are actively managed mutual funds that
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:11.320]   people own. Don't try to, my summary statement is don't try to get in or out based upon the bull
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.320]   market of the bear market. Know what you own. And if you're happy with what you own, if you're happy
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:21.280]   with the job that your manager is doing, then stick with them because you, you, you, you, you
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:27.260]   ham, you ham, ham tie it with what's the hamstring. I don't know what the, the cliche is, but you,
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.300]   you screw it all up when you, when you take your, tell your portfolio manager,
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.340]   here, you can have my money when markets are going up, but all of a sudden I see that your
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.040]   performance is underperforming. So all of a sudden I'm going to pull my money out. No,
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.000]   it's your money. You've got the prerogative to do it, but it sure makes your manager's job
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.240]   a lot more difficult. And if you understand what your manager is doing, because you read your
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.060]   prospectus and you understand that your growth manager is out looking for companies that are
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:56.280]   going to grow, your value manager is out looking for companies that are bargain priced right now.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.960]   You've got, maybe you've got a manager that is, is, is using a,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:07.180]   a, a top-down investment approach. So in this situation, this manager is making their choices
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.700]   based upon the expectation of the macro economy. So he's seeing, okay, the economy is going to go
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:17.220]   down. He's adjusting on the other hand. And so if this manager is saying, I foresee this decline in
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.920]   economic prices, he's already adjusting the portfolio to that. On the other hand, if you're
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.220]   using a manager that's using more of a bottom-up approach, well, this person is ignoring the macro
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.560]   economy, or at least not considering that to be the highest value. And they're focusing on the
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.260]   individual company. So if you're using a manager that's using more of a bottom-up approach,
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.780]   well, yes, we have headwinds coming for the general economy, but here's a company that's
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.980]   going to sail right through that headwinds. And so if you're choosing a manager and that's their
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.600]   style that they're doing, then the headwinds mean nothing because they've already adjusted
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:51.720]   the portfolio for that. So hopefully that's clear, but the key is that you've got to understand,
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.560]   you've got to understand what you actually own with your investments. And even if you're worried
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.120]   about them, you know, performing, underperforming, recognize that your managers are going to be
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.000]   benchmarked. So the managers are going to be judged based upon their peers and on their
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.340]   benchmark returns. And so they are accounting for that in their portfolio. So if they're trying to,
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:15.340]   let's say that they have a suspicion that there are headwinds in the economy, so therefore it's
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.720]   likely that we're going to be entering into a bear market, they're going to adjust their strategy
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.460]   to try to deal with that. And they're going to try to outperform the benchmark,
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:28.220]   which is going to be probably some index such as the S&P 500 index. And they're going to try
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.960]   to outperform that benchmark because that benchmark is going to take a tumble.
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:35.440]   And so they're going to put some kind of strategy in place to try to limit the returns.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:43.200]   So just simply understand that if you are using these strategies, which these are the most common
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:49.280]   strategies to use, the best thing you could do is ignore the bear market and trust your managers
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:57.040]   to do it. Or if you're not hiring active managers, trust your, you know, the efficient market
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.200]   hypothesis to bring you through. And in that time, you're going to be able to do that. And so
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.120]   I'm going to go on a tangent here for a moment. The other thing is you've got to reinterpret what
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.960]   a bear market actually means. In a bear market, if you are in an accumulation phase of your
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.420]   financial life where you're accumulating money, you should be rejoicing over a bear market because
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:21.740]   it gives you opportunities to invest more money. And for some reason with stocks and bonds,
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:26.500]   for some reason with stocks and bonds, people don't view things rationally.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.720]   So if you go down and you, whether you are in, I don't know what you're into buying, but let's say
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.180]   you're into buying, you're in a bear market, you're in a bear market, you're in a bear market,
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.100]   buying electronic gadgets or clothes or something like that,
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.180]   and if you were to go down to your favorite store
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.260]   and all of a sudden see a bargain bin
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.140]   with your favorite electronic gadgets and your favorite clothes
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.080]   and there's a big sign above that says 50% off,
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.060]   you would double up or triple up
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.060]   and buy as many of those things as you could, right?
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.860]   In stocks it's the same way.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.940]   A good manager, to someone who's thinking about investments,
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.240]   buying companies is exactly the same thing.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.560]   And if you wake up and you say,
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.100]   look, all of my favorite companies,
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.340]   I've been watching this company,
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.740]   I want to buy Apple stock.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.820]   I think they're still the number one highest market cap,
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.640]   so we'll pick on Apple.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.500]   I'm not recommending you buy Apple stock.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.280]   If you say, I want to buy Apple stock,
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.640]   and you love Apple products
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.420]   and you're convinced that Apple is the way to go,
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.900]   but you've been sitting back looking at the price of Apple stock
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.340]   and saying, I'm just not so comfortable with this price.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.660]   If you woke up the next day and all of a sudden
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.660]   you saw on your morning news show
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.680]   that Apple price had plummeted in value by 50% overnight,
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.720]   and you knew there was nothing necessarily rational
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.580]   that was driving that,
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.840]   it wasn't that all of a sudden there was a big scandal,
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.400]   it wasn't that their product blew up
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.960]   and they were going to face a massive lawsuit,
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.720]   you would be rejoicing, or at least I would.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.980]   I would be thrilled.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.680]   And you'd double up and you'd sell your car,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.400]   you'd sell your house, you'd sell anything you could
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.820]   to get your hands on that Apple stock at 50% off.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.940]   This is what someone who is comfortable with markets
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.040]   and comfortable with investments,
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:54.840]   this is how they think,
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.880]   is that this is an advantage to load up
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.620]   on your favorite companies at bargains
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.940]   and bargain basement prices.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.820]   But in general, the general public doesn't think of this.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.160]   Now, here's the problem.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.000]   That only works in your accumulation phase.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.900]   So if you're in the accumulation phase,
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.000]   that would be how you would think.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.420]   But if you're living on your portfolio
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.640]   and you're sitting back and saying,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.180]   and you wake up and all of a sudden
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.980]   your portfolio value is destroyed in value by 50%,
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.120]   you're sweating bullets,
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.940]   which is why we need good financial planning.
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.900]   We're going to get to that after I finish my conversation
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.300]   and I'm going to answer your question
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.380]   of how to protect yourself.
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.600]   But recognize that these situations are very unique.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.480]   I'm in the accumulation phase.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.740]   My father is in the distribution phase.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.420]   So I would be rejoicing
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.820]   if the Dow tomorrow morning,
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.200]   if I woke up tomorrow morning
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.060]   and the Dow had plummeted from 17,000 points
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.780]   to 7,000 points,
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.300]   I would be dancing in the street
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.840]   and I would be trying to persuade my wife
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.120]   to sell everything we own and buy stocks.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.280]   But my dad, on the other hand,
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.640]   he'd be in a different situation.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.920]   Because if he's living on those values,
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.240]   that's going to dramatically affect the value.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:33:59.580]   And so if he's living on those values,
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.780]   if he's doing some kind of share liquidation strategy
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.300]   to provide for his retirement income,
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.580]   this would be a problem.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.000]   And so that's where good financial planning comes in.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.580]   So it's not a simple answer.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.360]   I want to keep going, though,
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.440]   because I hope this helps.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.580]   In one way,
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.620]   there are no simple answers with financial planning.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.320]   In another way,
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.360]   there are tons of simple answers in financial planning.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.340]   And that's what you're going to find throughout the show
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.020]   is that there's tons of little maxims
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.820]   and little things that make sense to people.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.280]   But as you start to dig in,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:29.560]   you'll find out that there are tons of little maxims
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.540]   and you'll find lots of situations
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.780]   where those don't apply.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.300]   And you've got to look at your individual self,
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.440]   your individual person,
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.160]   and your individual situation for the answer.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.500]   So let's say you're a trader.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.520]   Trader, not trator.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.800]   So you're a trader.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.780]   You are trading your stocks.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.200]   So if you are a trader,
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.480]   you may be doing this yourself
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.600]   or you may be hiring a manager to trade this for you.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.460]   So one of the, some people say, advantages,
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.000]   some people say disadvantages,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.420]   of mutual funds is that in general,
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.540]   mutual funds are not permitted to use
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.720]   some of the more sophisticated and riskier strategies.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.120]   Again, some people would see this as an advantage.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.340]   Some people's a disadvantage.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.820]   I could argue both sides equally well.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.400]   I'm not going to share my opinion on it.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.520]   My job is to teach you about how the perspective risks
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.700]   and the perspective advantages.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.140]   So in general, mutual funds are restricted
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.740]   from using any or using a lot of margins.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.080]   So using leverage, buying,
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.880]   borrowing money to buy and sell securities.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.060]   They're limited on selling short.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.380]   They're limited on using derivatives
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.600]   to trade investments.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.720]   So then you go over to the hedge fund world.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.960]   Well, in the hedge fund world,
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.800]   you've got a lot more freedom.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.080]   Hedge funds are allowed to invest.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.860]   They're just simply not restricted
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:44.920]   like mutual funds are.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.960]   Hedge funds can invest in a wider variety of assets.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.400]   They can do stuff like take up positions
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.140]   in really illiquid assets
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.320]   that can be really difficult to sell.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.580]   So this would be where you go in
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.400]   and this is not something that's very tradable.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.500]   Whereas a mutual fund,
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.840]   can't take up the position.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.020]   Let me explain why.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.840]   A mutual fund is usually limited
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.140]   from exposing a large percentage of its portfolio.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.740]   There's all kinds of rules as far as the percentages.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:10.000]   But a mutual fund is limited from exposing
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.900]   a large percentage of its portfolio
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.320]   to an illiquid investment.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.840]   So if there's a company that is there on,
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.860]   if there's a company that a mutual fund manager
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.480]   is looking at,
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.640]   but this company is going through financial distress
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.660]   and it's probably going to be very difficult to sell,
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.040]   the mutual fund manager probably isn't going
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.920]   to be able to buy it.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.480]   Because if all of a sudden that mutual fund
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.920]   clients come and redeem their shares,
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.680]   the manager has to be able to sell that investment out
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.520]   and sell the investment
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.740]   to be able to allow the investors
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.160]   in the mutual fund to redeem their shares.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.940]   Now a hedge fund can invest in the illiquid assets.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.800]   And the reason is because the hedge fund
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.760]   can put in rules that lock up the investor's money.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.340]   So a hedge fund can require its investors
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.200]   to keep their money in the funds
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.580]   for months or even years at a time.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.660]   So this is why, if my memory is correct,
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.200]   I think a few years ago you saw,
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.920]   the hedge fund bought, what was it,
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.920]   Chrysler, Daimler Chrysler.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.140]   When Daimler sold Chrysler Corp.,
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.200]   what was the hedge fund that bought?
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.040]   I don't remember the name,
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.420]   but there was a hedge fund that bought Chrysler Corporation.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.880]   I can't remember if they still sell it or not.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.040]   I had to Google it and research it.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:14.500]   I don't remember.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.520]   So you go check that out.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.020]   But in that situation, you have a struggling company.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.280]   That's a very illiquid investment.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.080]   That was different than at the time buying Ford stock.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   So if you could buy Ford Corporation stock,
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.420]   that was a very active market.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.760]   That was different than Chrysler,
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.280]   because Chrysler was facing some issues.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.420]   So the hedge fund can,
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.240]   come in and the hedge fund investor has a lockup period
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.320]   where they're not permitted to pull their money,
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.380]   no matter if they want it or not.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.000]   The hedge fund manager can just say,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.760]   sorry, I'm not giving you your money back.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.700]   And so now that hedge fund manager has the time
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.240]   to pursue something like that,
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.700]   to pursue an illiquid investment.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.120]   Well, what does that mean with regard to a bear market?
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.680]   Well, that's when a hedge fund manager
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.040]   is going to be making all of their major investments,
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   if they have it,
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.560]   because they've got the lockup.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.540]   They can go ahead and they've got the lockup period
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.820]   where they've got the money guaranteed.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.040]   And now they can go ahead and do that
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:37:59.420]   and they can decide,
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.660]   dispose of the asset over time according to their plan.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.060]   This is why in general,
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.300]   hedge funds are limited to accredited investors.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.380]   Basically, the ideas behind an accredited investor
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.680]   is an accredited investor has to own at least,
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   I think it's 5 million bucks of investments,
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.080]   ignoring their primary residence.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.100]   And they're the only ones that can invest in,
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.640]   and there's another thing on income.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.180]   I can't remember.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.500]   It's something like $250,000 of income
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.300]   or something like that.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.500]   That's what makes an accredited investor.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.400]   And the idea here is that an accredited investor
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.780]   should be smart enough to do their own due diligence.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.480]   So a hedge fund can't go out
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.320]   and if you pick up Money Magazine,
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.700]   you'll see mutual fund advertisements all over the place.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.860]   You'll never see a hedge fund advertisement in Money Magazine
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.700]   because a hedge fund is not allowed to advertise
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:43.680]   to the general public.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.380]   They can only market themselves to an accredited investor
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.500]   because these strategies are sophisticated
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.080]   and they come with a higher degree of risk of loss.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.200]   And so that's the difference.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.420]   So they might make a lot more money.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.440]   I don't know.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.400]   I have to go and research
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.280]   what ended up happening with Chrysler.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:38:59.440]   I don't know.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.020]   Because it would be an interesting case study.
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.540]   I just remember that from a few years ago.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.520]   I was paying attention to it.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.920]   But I don't know if they made money or not.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.460]   I hope they did.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.760]   But this would be one of the major differences.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.740]   A hedge fund can use extensive amounts of leverage.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.000]   So the hedge fund can borrow a lot of money
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.780]   to try to blow up the investment returns.
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.600]   Well, that can be awesome if it turns out well.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.780]   That can also be really tough if it doesn't work.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.000]   Leverage is a two-sided sword.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.080]   And so depending on your risk profile,
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.360]   as far as you're concerned,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.780]   as far as how comfortable you are with that,
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.960]   which would come down to personal financial planning,
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.700]   that would be a major thing to consider.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.560]   If you didn't have anything to lose
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.300]   by employing a lot of leverage,
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.840]   it may be smart to employ it.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.560]   If you've got a lot to lose by employing leverage
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.460]   and you don't need it,
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.240]   what's the point of an extra $20 million
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.500]   if you've already got some?
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.200]   Don't risk it.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.080]   It would be silly to risk it.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.960]   And that would be a very individual decision.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.340]   A hedge fund can use short sales.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.000]   So they can sell stock short.
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.260]   So in this situation,
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.340]   if a hedge fund manager were saying,
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.300]   I'm going to go ahead
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.100]   and I perceive economic headwinds,
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.440]   I perceive a bear market coming,
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.160]   well, they can short all over the place.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.480]   They could short individual stocks.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.740]   They could short the general market.
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.960]   They could short specific asset classes.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.280]   They could short all kinds of things.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.680]   And that would allow them to make gains
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.240]   when the market prices are going down
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.020]   if their shorting strategy works out well.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.780]   So there's a lot of different things
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.220]   that these funds could do.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.320]   And just to give you
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:29.760]   an idea,
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.140]   I mean, just to start,
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.740]   I don't know if you've ever studied,
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.880]   if you've ever studied
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.260]   sophisticated portfolio management,
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:35.940]   it's fascinating.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.300]   But you would have different strategies.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.620]   Here are a few strategies
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.880]   that I just made some notes on
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.460]   that I thought would be fun to go over.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.120]   So a hedge fund manager could use
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.540]   the equity long short.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.100]   And so this was the strategy
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.980]   that was used,
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.600]   and still is used,
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.580]   was used, excuse me,
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.880]   by the oldest hedge fund,
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.300]   which was the,
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.160]   which was a fund called
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.680]   the A.W. Jones and Company.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.480]   So under this strategy,
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.100]   what the manager does
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.600]   is the manager will buy some stocks long
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.680]   and sell some stocks short.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.860]   This is still the most popular
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.960]   hedge fund strategy today.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.000]   And so I think industry numbers,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.600]   I was pulling this from,
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.200]   well, this is a few years old now,
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.160]   but I'm pulling this from
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.460]   Robert Posen and Teresa Hammacher's book
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.500]   called Fund Industry.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.980]   And they say about 30% of all hedge fund assets
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.580]   globally are allocated to the equity long short.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.980]   And so here,
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.600]   the hedge fund manager is ignoring
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.440]   the economic headwinds
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.680]   as far as in general.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.540]   And they're buying stocks
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.360]   that they consider to be undervalued long.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.020]   So they're hoping that those stocks go up.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.160]   And they're buying stocks
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.020]   that they consider to be overvalued
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.640]   and they're selling them short,
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.120]   hoping that the prices will go down.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.860]   So this is not a strategy
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.840]   for the general market.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.880]   This is a strategy
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.460]   for the specific companies.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.160]   Although, you know,
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.040]   theoretically you could do,
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.160]   you could use this in asset classes
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.920]   or in various parts of the market.
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:41:59.940]   Number two would be
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.680]   the relative value strategy or arbitrage.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.960]   So relative value is a long short strategy,
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.220]   but it would involve
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.720]   the specific types of securities
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.280]   or assets other than stocks.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.180]   So you could use a strategy
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.620]   called a merger arbitrage.
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.520]   And so under this scenario,
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.820]   a hedge fund would buy shares of a company
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.480]   that is in the process of being acquired
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.580]   and short the shares of the acquirer
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.800]   and try to take the value
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.280]   of the arbitrage relationship,
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.080]   the difference in pricing between those two,
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.240]   those two stocks.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.560]   A relative value manager
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.220]   would look at the past relationships
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.040]   between different securities
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.520]   that are issued by the same company
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.160]   and try to profit from what they,
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.960]   from where they're different
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.200]   from historical norms.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.760]   One kind of variation of this
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.160]   would be convertible arbitrage,
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.020]   which would mean
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.800]   you would buy a convertible security
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.620]   and sell short the underlying stock.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.400]   So if there were a convertible security
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.160]   that you could get a hands on
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.920]   and then just sell short the stock
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.220]   and wait on the arbitrage,
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:42:59.720]   you would have a hedge opportunity
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.640]   between the two to make your money.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.700]   Intercredit strategy,
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:04.920]   you'd look at the relative value
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.960]   between different types of fixed income securities,
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.100]   such as corporate bonds versus government bonds,
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.120]   and try to exploit any mispricing
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:11.840]   that you could find.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.180]   So a hedge fund manager could pursue
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.000]   a distressed strategy.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.900]   So this would be buying the securities
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.080]   or other assets of a company
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.640]   that's in or near bankruptcy.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.480]   And so you remember movies back from the 80s
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.760]   of the corporate titans going in
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.360]   and trying to say,
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.700]   we're going to buy up this company
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:29.080]   that's,
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.480]   that's in near bankruptcy
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.500]   and sell off all the assets.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.160]   Still happens.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.020]   You just got to find the right opportunity.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.300]   Shareholder activism.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.260]   So this is where hedge funds get involved a lot.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:37.740]   And they say,
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.180]   we have this company,
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.120]   but we're going to try to make a major change
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.460]   in the way this company is managed.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.900]   So we're going to try to buy enough of the shares
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:46.820]   that we can get,
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.160]   buy enough of the shares
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.680]   that we can get some voice in it,
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.160]   or we're going to try to market
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.560]   the changes that we want.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.920]   So we're going to market to the shareholders
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.520]   and we're going to say,
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:54.820]   listen,
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.660]   here's how the company could be better served
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.140]   so that at the next annual meeting,
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:58.440]   we can,
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.180]   we can clear the market.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:43:59.940]   We can clear the board of directors
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.540]   from these three directors
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.520]   who are standing in our way
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.120]   and install our new board of directors
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.260]   to take the company in the way
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:05.460]   that,
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.680]   that we're going to,
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.260]   that we think is better.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.580]   You could use a global macro view strategy.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.480]   So you could say,
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.740]   we have a view
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.600]   on what the macro economic events
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.160]   that are coming.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.260]   So for example,
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.740]   changes in interest rates,
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.900]   changes in the relative value of currencies,
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.100]   maybe the global supply and demand
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.060]   for natural resources.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.340]   We're going to take a position on this
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.600]   and we're going to make a bet
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.280]   that this happens.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.160]   And so probably,
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.600]   the most famous example of that
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.140]   is George Soros' short sale
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.820]   of the British pound back in 1992.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.100]   And so he's,
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.220]   he was known as the man
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.340]   who broke the bank of England
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:38.940]   because he sold,
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.340]   he sold short the British pound,
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.300]   made, I don't know,
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.260]   was it a billion dollars,
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:42.800]   something like that?
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.840]   I had to go research it again,
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.600]   but made a huge amount of money
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.120]   because he said,
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.200]   this is what's going to happen.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.280]   There was a guy,
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.240]   I forget his name,
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.120]   but there was a guy back in 2008
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.160]   that sold short the,
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.420]   the housing.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.100]   What,
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.420]   what instrument did he use?
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.920]   I forget the,
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.940]   I forget what he,
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:02.340]   what,
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.400]   what he actually sold short,
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:04.960]   whether it was the,
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:05.700]   the,
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:06.660]   the,
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:07.240]   what's,
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.320]   whether it was the securities,
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.240]   the package securities
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:09.980]   that were being traded.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:10.500]   But basically,
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.220]   he took,
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.260]   he was a doctor,
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.300]   a practicing medical physician
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.340]   who enjoyed this
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.440]   and he sold this,
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.520]   there's a game on it called,
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.060]   I think it was called,
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:18.920]   there was a book,
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.320]   I think it was called
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:20.900]   The Great Short.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:21.340]   I have to,
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:22.500]   I have to go and check it.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.340]   It's on my reading list.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.000]   But he sold short
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:25.940]   the whole housing market
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.140]   and made tons of money
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:27.940]   because he said,
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:28.160]   look,
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.000]   the whole housing market,
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.020]   it's falling apart here
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.760]   and he made a ton of money on it.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.920]   Managed futures.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.660]   So managed futures would be,
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:35.000]   you know,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.580]   doing some sort of commodity trading
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.900]   where you,
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.520]   a managed futures hedge fund
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.520]   would invest in,
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.580]   in futures contracts
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.640]   on various types of,
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.020]   of,
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:43.660]   of commodities.
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.240]   So energy,
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:44.660]   metals,
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:45.140]   grains,
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.400]   things like that
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.400]   and on the financial market.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.260]   So they would trade
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.740]   the futures market
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.220]   without,
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:50.680]   you know,
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.800]   based upon their hunch
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.460]   about the direction
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:52.860]   of the,
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.920]   of the investment.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.380]   You could combine
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.240]   all these together
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:57.900]   and you can,
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.100]   you could combine all
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:45:59.720]   these strategies,
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.340]   pick and pull from the ones
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:01.820]   that you want,
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.840]   add in leverage,
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.640]   borrow money
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:04.880]   to enhance your returns.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.280]   I mean,
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.260]   there's all kinds of things
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:06.540]   that,
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.420]   that you could do
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.440]   if you were running a hedge fund.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.060]   But if you were in that kind of,
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.720]   in that kind of fund
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.220]   and a hedge fund
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:12.880]   is a good example,
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.280]   you got your money locked up
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.580]   and you just got to sit back
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.220]   and you got to trust,
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.020]   trust your manager.
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.440]   So a lot of times
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.160]   people aren't familiar
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:19.720]   with the concept
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.960]   of trusting their active
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.160]   portfolio manager
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.120]   or trusting their passive strategy.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.660]   They're much more familiar
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:26.740]   with the idea,
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.400]   however,
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.500]   if you're buying into a hedge fund
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:28.940]   and they tell you
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:29.080]   there's,
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:29.820]   there's a two-year lockup
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.300]   on your money,
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:30.780]   well,
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.380]   now you've got,
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.180]   you've got to,
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.260]   you've just got to go with it.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.360]   If you're running
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.140]   your own portfolio,
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.520]   so let's say that you are
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.980]   running your own portfolio
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.600]   and you're trading
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.460]   some individual stocks,
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:41.320]   you could use
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.560]   some very basic techniques.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.000]   So if you wanted
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:44.380]   to prepare,
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.280]   protect yourself
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.440]   from a bear market,
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.800]   you might do a,
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.740]   you might put a collar
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:49.400]   on your stock
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.060]   and you say,
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:50.300]   okay,
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.540]   if the price rises
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.500]   from $20 to $30
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.860]   and then it retreats
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.400]   to $28,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.380]   I want to sell that,
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.300]   I want to sell that,
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.160]   that stock price,
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.420]   that stock out
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.020]   automatically.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.840]   At $28 a share.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.900]   You could do it
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.360]   where over time,
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.640]   if you're,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.500]   let's say that you'll,
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.140]   you buy the stock
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:06.440]   at $10
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.500]   and you say,
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.540]   I'm going to sell it out
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.880]   at $12,
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.040]   I'm going to sell 20%.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:11.760]   At $14,
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.800]   I'm going to sell 20%.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.340]   At $18,
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:13.840]   I'm going to sell,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.180]   you know,
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:14.660]   20%
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.120]   and I'll keep riding some
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.360]   but then I'll put a,
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.800]   I'll put a collar on it
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   that would allow the,
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.060]   that would allow the,
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.560]   the value to still be held
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.180]   if,
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:23.760]   if,
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.460]   if,
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.900]   if the market were to decline.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:26.980]   Maybe you're going
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.640]   to trade options.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.360]   So if,
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.040]   so one,
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:29.860]   one way to protect yourself
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:30.560]   in a bear market,
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.980]   you may own a stock
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.260]   and you say,
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:33.540]   well,
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.200]   I own this stock
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.580]   but I'm concerned
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:37.300]   about the,
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.560]   the market going down
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.220]   so I'm going to go ahead
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.120]   and buy a put option
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.640]   on the stock.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.440]   So a put option
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.340]   would allow me
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.200]   to sell the stock
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.180]   at a guaranteed price.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:44.820]   Now you're going to pay
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:45.500]   for the option
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.880]   so you may choose
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.380]   not to exercise the option
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.620]   but that would allow you
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.500]   to have a,
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.900]   that would allow you to,
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.480]   that would allow you
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.640]   to have a,
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.880]   a strategy in place
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:56.840]   if the value of the stock
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.620]   were to decline.
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.840]   Or you know what,
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:47:59.620]   you could just simply
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:00.800]   be confident in the company
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.220]   and just sit tight
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.120]   and buy more
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.180]   when the price dumps.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.140]   And so,
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.180]   you know,
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.420]   the example that I think of here
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.340]   is can you imagine,
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.420]   let's,
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.300]   let's pick on Walmart.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:10.920]   All right.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.160]   Walmart stock,
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.400]   Sam Walton distributes
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.280]   the majority of the stock,
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.320]   goes out to his children
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.960]   and to the Walton Foundation.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.600]   So they've got
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.840]   massive amounts of stock
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.600]   and they're vested
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.180]   in the company.
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.460]   Can you imagine
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.020]   if Walmart stock
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.000]   declines in value
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.860]   by 20%
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.700]   because they get
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.900]   some stupid lawsuit
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:27.840]   or they get some
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.500]   union issue
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:29.000]   or they get some
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.860]   bad press
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:30.320]   or they get,
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:30.780]   you know,
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:30.960]   they,
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:31.320]   they,
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.200]   they have a truck
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:32.820]   that blows up
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:33.640]   on the side of the road.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.480]   Can you imagine
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.000]   the Walton Family Foundation
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.700]   and the Walton Family members
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:38.620]   all of a sudden saying,
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:39.320]   that's it,
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.260]   we don't have confidence
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:40.920]   in our company?
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.480]   You know,
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:42.940]   we don't think
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:43.580]   we're going to come back
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:43.940]   from this,
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:45.100]   we got this 20% loss,
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.160]   we just got to sell our stock?
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:46.980]   No.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:47.900]   I mean,
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.320]   I can't,
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:48.840]   maybe you can,
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.140]   but I can't even imagine that.
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.020]   They would say,
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:51.580]   you know what,
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.360]   we're so confident
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:52.880]   in our company,
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.560]   we'll buy everything
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.100]   that we can.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.220]   You saw that this last year
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:55.560]   if you paid,
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.340]   if you pay attention
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:56.880]   to this stuff
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:57.940]   and you saw that
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:59.000]   the Walton Family
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.780]   is buying back
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:01.600]   as much of their own stock
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.140]   as they can.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.100]   And so they're looking
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:03.700]   at the marketplace
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:04.320]   and they're saying,
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:04.640]   you know what,
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.460]   the best investment
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.720]   we can find right now
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:07.280]   is our stock,
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.040]   it's undervalued,
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.060]   so we're going to buy it back
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.140]   and we're going to go ahead
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:10.840]   and buy our own stock
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.900]   and increase our share price
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.440]   by lowering the number
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.240]   of shares outstanding
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:14.780]   on the market.
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:15.980]   Can you imagine
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.340]   the Buffett kids
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.260]   or a better example
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:19.720]   would be the Bill
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.860]   and Melinda Gates Foundation
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:21.140]   where,
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.620]   so Warren Buffett
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:23.480]   gives most of his stock,
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.940]   his Berkshire Hathaway stock
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.300]   to the Bill
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.240]   and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.900]   And he's doing it over time.
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.900]   Can you imagine
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.500]   the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.540]   portfolio manager
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.580]   waking up one morning
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.420]   and seeing that
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.440]   Berkshire Hathaway
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.940]   for no external reason
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:36.580]   that no one can,
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.440]   anyone can find,
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.440]   but all of a sudden
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.520]   there's no major fraud
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.300]   that was discovered,
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:40.700]   it wasn't,
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.880]   they didn't pull an Enron
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.700]   or a WorldCom,
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.560]   but all of a sudden
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.360]   he wakes up and says
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.320]   the Berkshire Hathaway
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.540]   stock price declined
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:49.560]   by 15%
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.340]   or 20%
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.140]   or 30%.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:51.820]   So therefore
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.280]   the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.280]   we got to dump our,
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:54.760]   what is it,
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.480]   $40 billion
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.220]   or something
[00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:57.660]   I could be off
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:58.120]   on that number,
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.340]   but we got to dump
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.560]   our billions of dollars
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.220]   of stock
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.140]   into the market
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.740]   because of this 20% decline?
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:06.280]   I can't imagine it.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.640]   And so the problem is
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.340]   is that hopefully,
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:08.880]   I mean hopefully
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.040]   those examples help
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.720]   to understand a little bit,
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:12.820]   but those people
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:13.580]   are thinking about
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.320]   the great company
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:14.860]   that we own.
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.620]   Berkshire Hathaway,
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.480]   this huge,
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.940]   widely diversified company
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.960]   with lines of income
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.540]   and profits
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.880]   across the entire world,
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.360]   across various industries,
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.640]   this really strong
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.240]   balance sheet,
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.200]   these world-class
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.560]   company managers running it,
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.740]   this incredible culture,
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:29.980]   this incredible reputation,
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.160]   this incredibly low basis.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.800]   We've got these good companies
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.760]   at these great prices.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.240]   We've got a great reputation
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:36.920]   where basically
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.540]   everyone thinks
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:38.440]   Warren Buffett's God
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.300]   and if he says something
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:39.940]   about investing,
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:40.760]   it must be true
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.120]   and that therefore
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:43.880]   Warren says
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.060]   this is what you should do
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:46.040]   so this is what you should do
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:46.980]   and the whole world
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:47.680]   jumps to it.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.940]   Can you imagine them
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.380]   just really even being concerned
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.860]   about those fluctuations
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:52.740]   in stock price?
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.440]   No,
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.120]   because they know
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.080]   the underlying company.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.160]   Same thing
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:56.640]   with Walmart.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.620]   Can you imagine
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:58.680]   the Walton family saying,
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:58.840]   well,
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.820]   our price value declined
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.340]   in 10%
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:00.840]   so therefore
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.440]   we're just going to
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.060]   throw up our hands
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:02.620]   and say that's it,
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:03.260]   we've got to leave
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:03.820]   this business?
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:04.860]   No,
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.500]   because they know
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.200]   the company.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.840]   They understand
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.100]   that a stock
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:10.960]   is ownership
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.540]   in a company.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:12.520]   Now,
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.120]   are there people
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.280]   trading all around
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.000]   the edges of that?
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:15.540]   Absolutely.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:17.100]   I guarantee you
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:17.840]   there's people trading
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.720]   Berkshire Hathaway,
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.680]   there's people trading Walmart.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.660]   You've got everything
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:21.780]   from a flash trader
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:22.880]   owning a stock
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.080]   for a few microseconds
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.220]   on the way through
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.120]   up in New York
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:26.980]   where he's got these guys
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:27.740]   that you pay extra
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:28.960]   to get your Bloomberg terminal
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:29.840]   closer to the
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.160]   internet connection
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.740]   so that your computer
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:35.640]   can start the trade
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.820]   a couple microseconds
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:37.600]   before your competitor
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.420]   across the street
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.580]   and so you can profit
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.360]   on the arbitrage
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.220]   between this tiny little
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.560]   fraction of a stock price.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.100]   Yes,
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:45.740]   there's people doing
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:46.340]   that every day.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:47.620]   Could you be a day trader
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:48.200]   where you're saying
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:48.660]   I'm going to go
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.280]   on each and every
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:49.940]   and I'm going to hold
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.620]   my stock out
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:51.120]   in the morning
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:51.580]   and the evening
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.640]   and really trade it
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.080]   with one day?
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:53.580]   Absolutely.
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.940]   Can you do some sort
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:55.540]   of swing trade
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:56.080]   where you're covering
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.200]   out over a couple of days
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:57.900]   or a couple of weeks?
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:58.600]   Absolutely.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.480]   But in none of those situations
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.160]   are you worrying
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.100]   about the general
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.160]   bear market?
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.080]   The micro trader,
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:05.740]   the day trader,
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:06.440]   he doesn't care
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.000]   about what the market
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:08.880]   is doing over this
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.880]   several month period
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:10.320]   of time.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.560]   He or she cares
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.540]   about what's going on
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.960]   within their trading horizon.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.620]   Now,
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:15.640]   could you be a momentum trader
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.080]   and kind of over
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:16.560]   a longer period?
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.060]   Absolutely.
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:17.980]   Could you be looking
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.080]   for some kind of good news
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:19.420]   that you think
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:19.900]   is going to happen?
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:20.320]   Absolutely.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.140]   There's people doing
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.080]   trading on every single
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:26.040]   aspect of it
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.300]   but all of these things
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.220]   together make up
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:29.700]   the market.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.560]   It is not stupid
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.440]   just to sit back
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:32.780]   and say,
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:33.380]   you know what?
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.000]   My granddaddy
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:35.960]   started Coca-Cola
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.440]   and my granddaddy
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.300]   left me $10 million
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.580]   of Coca-Cola stock
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:40.920]   and I think Coca-Cola
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.440]   is pretty good.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.000]   They're in hundreds
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.480]   of countries
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.360]   around the world.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.120]   They've got this
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:47.140]   incredible moat
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.040]   as the investment
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:48.660]   people would say.
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.580]   It's a great,
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:50.320]   well-run company.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.040]   I've got good managers.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.020]   I'm going to
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:54.280]   completely ignore
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.500]   with the exception
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.000]   of reading my book
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.040]   my annual report.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.100]   I'm going to
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:58.940]   completely ignore
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:52:59.560]   what happens
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.600]   to the Coca-Cola stock
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.480]   on a daily basis
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.700]   and I'm going to
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:03.700]   go play golf every day
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:04.340]   or whatever their
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.120]   version of that is.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.080]   Is that stupid?
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.500]   I don't think so.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.620]   I'd be happy
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.240]   to own $10 million
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.380]   of Coca-Cola stock
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.080]   and I'd feel,
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:11.800]   hey, it's pretty good.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.960]   I might go ahead
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.720]   and I might like
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.820]   to own a few other companies
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.080]   in case something happened
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.180]   but if my granddaddy
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.240]   started Coca-Cola
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.980]   or whoever the story is,
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.600]   whatever it is,
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.700]   what do I have to fear?
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:26.740]   I mean, again,
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:27.820]   good financial planning
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:28.540]   is going to come into that
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.800]   with personal financial planning,
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.220]   lifestyle,
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.220]   having a margin in your life,
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:33.060]   not having,
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:34.120]   being overcommitted,
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.580]   being able to handle the swings
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.780]   if the dividend has to be cut,
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.420]   those types of things
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.220]   but that's called
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.220]   financial planning.
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.560]   So the point of this
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.820]   is trust your managers
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:43.980]   if you have them
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.680]   and if you don't have managers,
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.860]   understand your philosophy
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.480]   and if you don't understand
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.060]   your philosophy,
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.500]   don't invest in stocks.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.760]   If you can't handle it,
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.740]   if you don't have a plan
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.720]   in place in advance
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:55.920]   for the future,
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.620]   the bear market,
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:57.860]   then don't ever get in
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:58.580]   in the first place.
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.320]   In some ways,
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.180]   one of the best things
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:01.920]   and one of the worst things
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:02.540]   that ever happened
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.440]   was 401ks
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.660]   and we'll talk,
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.160]   I always say,
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:06.840]   we'll talk about this
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.240]   in the future.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.760]   There's so much to talk about.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.340]   I think I could do
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:10.080]   a thousand shows
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:10.940]   of two hours long
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:11.840]   talking about things
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:12.580]   I'm interested in
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.020]   but if you look at 401ks
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:14.680]   and if you look at
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.480]   kind of the history
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.400]   of the 401k,
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.080]   these days,
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.300]   most people have
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.980]   some version of a 401k
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.860]   whether it's that actual 401k,
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:22.960]   whether it's the
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.900]   non-profit equivalent
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.200]   which would be a 403b,
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:25.900]   whether it's the
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.440]   smaller business equivalent
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.500]   which would be a SEP IRA
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.560]   or a simple IRA
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.820]   or something like that.
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:31.680]   Most people have,
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.460]   these days,
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.680]   some kind of plan
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.440]   that they can adjust
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.000]   the investments
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.260]   as far as their pension plan,
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.920]   their individual pension plan.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.700]   Originally,
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:39.620]   in case you're interested,
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:41.060]   originally a 401k
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.120]   is designed,
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.160]   a 401k is more appropriately
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.520]   designed as a profit sharing plan.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.640]   It is technically
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.300]   a profit sharing plan
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:50.880]   and that's what it can be set up
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.840]   but what the 401k added
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.860]   is it added
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:55.460]   what's called
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:55.880]   401k
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.560]   to a profit sharing plan
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.860]   and the 401k
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:00.720]   allowed people
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.800]   to defer
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.360]   some of their own income
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.160]   into that account
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.680]   and so to not have to pay
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.480]   taxes on the money currently
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.880]   to be able to defer their income.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.940]   And so over the last
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.080]   about 40, 50 years,
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.180]   you've seen a tremendous change
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.100]   in the corporate world
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.640]   between a traditional
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.020]   defined benefit pension
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:19.920]   which is where
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:20.980]   I work at this company,
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.060]   I turn 65,
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.140]   they guarantee to pay me
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.320]   60% of my finishing salary
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:25.860]   for the rest of my life.
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:28.220]   You had a tremendous conversion
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.200]   from a defined benefit pension
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.400]   to a defined contribution pension.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.080]   When a defined benefit pension,
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.000]   you had an investment manager.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:36.820]   This would be
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.580]   a professional investment manager
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:39.720]   and this is the person
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.440]   who's responsible
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.500]   for making sure
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.360]   that our pension is funded such
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.680]   that we can support these payments
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:46.380]   that we've promised.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.880]   And now,
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:48.700]   it's on the people.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.160]   So now,
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:50.280]   you can pull up on your phone,
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.860]   you can log into your
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:54.100]   Fidelity 401k account
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.020]   and you can buy
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:55.840]   and trade stocks right now.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.120]   You can buy it in there
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:56.620]   on your phone.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.020]   Now, is that an advantage
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:58.720]   for some people?
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.220]   It's a huge advantage.
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.700]   It's a huge advantage.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.700]   If you're an investment guy
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.240]   and the fact that you can sit up there
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.400]   and you love to trade stocks
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.060]   and you can do this
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:07.860]   in your 401k
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:08.840]   and you can defer
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.000]   $17,500 in there,
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.780]   you can throw in another $5,500
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.440]   if you're over the age of 50,
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.500]   you can have a profit sharing
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.840]   contribution in there,
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.600]   you could get $51,000
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.020]   into that account every year.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.380]   I was talking to somebody
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.340]   yesterday about setting up
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.200]   a solo 401k
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:25.820]   and getting $50,000
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:26.960]   in there.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.980]   So, if I were a stock trader,
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:30.560]   I would say,
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.340]   you're telling me
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.300]   that I can set up an account
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:33.240]   and if I structure it right,
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.360]   I can get $50,000
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.280]   in this account
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.800]   and I can do this
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.720]   before paying any income tax at all
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.220]   and I can buy and sell.
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.120]   I can ignore all
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.380]   of the short-term capital gains,
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:43.720]   long-term capital gains rules.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.420]   I can day trade in this account
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.340]   on the 401k.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.020]   You're telling me
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:47.400]   I can do that?
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.340]   No, there's limitations.
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:49.880]   Ignore that I'm speaking
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.580]   in broad strokes.
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:52.500]   But you're telling me
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:53.280]   I can do that right on my phone?
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.000]   That's amazing.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:54.820]   But yet,
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:55.800]   for the average person,
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.060]   who has no interest
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.280]   in trading stocks
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.580]   or has no interest
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:01.780]   in these funds,
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:02.920]   all they know to do is,
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.620]   every few months,
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:04.680]   they open up their computer
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:05.240]   and they say,
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.660]   my mutual fund is down
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.480]   and they switch the money
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:08.180]   to the mutual fund
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:09.000]   that has a green arrow
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.560]   next to it
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.720]   and it's up 6%
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.420]   instead of the mine
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.180]   which has a red arrow
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.320]   and it's down 11%.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.400]   This is the worst thing
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.020]   that ever happened
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.260]   to people's investment accounts.
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.320]   And I think we know
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.080]   this intuitively.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:19.880]   This is where,
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.820]   if you want to ask somebody,
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.040]   if you want to ask somebody
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.080]   kind of intuitively
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.480]   about doing it yourself
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:25.780]   versus doing it
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:26.700]   versus hiring somebody
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.960]   and you have the financial world
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.360]   that says,
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.260]   well, you're better off
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.260]   just doing it yourself
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:32.300]   but yet you've got
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:33.460]   all these financial advisors
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:33.820]   that say,
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:34.840]   hire me, hire me.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.620]   I mean,
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.680]   the equivalent is this.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.460]   If you could invest your money
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.160]   with the Harvard Endowment Fund
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.240]   and you could have
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.060]   the manager of the
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:42.980]   Harvard Endowment Fund
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.060]   investing your money
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.460]   with that fund,
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.600]   would you rather do that
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.460]   or would you rather
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:49.640]   invest the money yourself
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.680]   and choose your investments
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.300]   for yourself?
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.140]   The majority of people
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:54.980]   in my experience
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:55.760]   that I've talked to
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.320]   have given that kind of either or
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:57.940]   would say,
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:58.760]   I'd rather have my money
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:57:59.940]   alongside the Harvard Endowment.
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:02.000]   And that's kind of how pensions used to be
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.080]   because the pension legally
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.620]   had to provide for the person
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.320]   under this certain formula payout.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.140]   And now,
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.280]   it doesn't have to do so.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.140]   So, trust your managers.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.000]   And then,
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.460]   the last thing I have on this
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:15.120]   and hopefully this is interesting.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.860]   Hopefully this is interesting.
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:18.720]   I just looked down
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.820]   and I've spent 50 minutes
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:21.060]   answering this question.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:21.880]   But,
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.340]   understand the difference
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.560]   between price and value.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.860]   And the example
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.900]   that I always use
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:28.580]   is to,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.340]   the example that I always use
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.820]   is real estate.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:33.460]   Now, real estate and stocks,
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:34.740]   stocks have a dramatically,
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.380]   a dramatic disadvantage
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:37.360]   from real estate.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.480]   In real estate,
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:39.320]   if I were to tell you
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.220]   every single day
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.540]   how much your house is worth,
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:43.360]   that would drive you nuts.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.860]   One day I come out
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:46.140]   and I say,
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:46.720]   hey, listen,
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.100]   I'll give you today
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:50.580]   $182,433 for your house.
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.600]   And the next day I come out
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:51.740]   and say,
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:53.680]   I'll give you $191,673
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:54.320]   for your house.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.660]   And the next day
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:55.720]   I come out
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.060]   and say,
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.220]   I'll give you $211,932
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:59.500]   for your house.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:00.480]   And the next day I come out
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:00.600]   and say,
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.860]   hey, today it's $133,467.67.
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.680]   That would drive you nuts.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.000]   That's what stocks do
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:07.520]   when you pay attention
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:07.960]   to them every day.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.760]   Every day there's price,
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.700]   price, price, price,
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:10.460]   price, price, price.
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.280]   Does price determine value?
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.740]   Does the value of your house
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.240]   as a place to shelter your family
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.020]   and a place to have a home
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:18.760]   built together,
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.160]   does that change
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.380]   based upon the price?
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:23.780]   It doesn't.
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:25.700]   Now, the price is important.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:26.680]   It's important over the long term.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.720]   But the reason why people will sit
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.620]   and own a house for a long time
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:31.520]   and why people who are
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.360]   real estate investors
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.580]   will very rarely trade their houses
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.580]   is A, because they're not very liquid
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:37.620]   because it's got a massive
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:38.900]   dollar figure next to it,
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.120]   but B, because it's really hard to sell
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.060]   and you don't actually know
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:42.900]   the final price
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:45.300]   until the sale happens.
[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.840]   That's the only time you know it.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.160]   And so it's a lot easier
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.000]   when in the reality
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.600]   the actual price of your house
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.220]   is up and down and up and down
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:53.520]   and up and down all the time.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.540]   And there's bear markets
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:55.240]   and bull markets
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:55.680]   on your house.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.760]   You're not aware of it
[00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.380]   because you're just simply
[00:59:58.380 --> 00:59:59.120]   living in that house
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.420]   and you have the value of the house.
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.840]   Well, to me,
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.620]   the most rational strategies
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:04.460]   for investments
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.780]   follow the same exact plan.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.420]   The most rational values
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.200]   for investments
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.920]   follow the idea that
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.680]   the most rational plans
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.280]   for investing
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.520]   follow the same idea,
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.900]   which is I'm going to focus
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.320]   on the value of my investment
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.900]   if you're investing.
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.100]   Or if you're trading,
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.060]   you're going to focus on
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.880]   the mechanics of my trade.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.200]   And here's the trade
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:29.900]   that I'm going to do.
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.060]   And I'm going to put this insurance
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.200]   in place in case I'm wrong.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.040]   I'm going to buy, sell these options.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.580]   I'm going to buy, sell these call options,
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.560]   these put options.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.860]   I'm going to put this collar.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:40.720]   I'm going to put a straddle.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.420]   You can do an option strategy
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.080]   where you make money on the downside
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.140]   and you make money on the upside
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.220]   and you only lose money
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.060]   if the market is flat.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.360]   You can make an option strategy
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.460]   where you only make money
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.500]   if the option is flat,
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.140]   if the market price
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.720]   of the underlying security is flat.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.980]   And that you lose money
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:57.780]   if it goes up or down.
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.940]   You can bet it both ways.
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.760]   Now, those are such individual examples,
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.760]   but my point is that
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.220]   all of this stuff together
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.740]   makes up the market.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.460]   So when I said how I would deliver market news
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.120]   is if I were actually doing
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.280]   a daily market news update,
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.780]   I would say today,
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.960]   millions and millions and millions
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.120]   of market participants
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.900]   bought and sold things
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.040]   based upon their own personal situation.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.020]   And the values and the prices
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:23.540]   at which things were bought and sold
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.360]   wandered around randomly
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:25.620]   based on their own personal situation.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.560]   Based upon the individual person's
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.720]   strategies and philosophies.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.920]   Now, in general,
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.940]   we saw that the general trend was this.
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:33.840]   And so therefore,
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.880]   these indexes that we manage is this.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.280]   And we think that it's possible
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.680]   that this bad news on the jobs report
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.620]   had this impact.
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:42.980]   Although we know there were probably
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:44.260]   some people that made a bunch of money
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:44.820]   off of that.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.020]   And we think it's possible
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.440]   that this negative forecast
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.700]   from this company analyst
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.480]   affected this company's price.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.680]   But the reality is
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.120]   we bet that somebody had that trade
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.420]   and made a bunch of money off of that.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.440]   And we can't actually
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.000]   report that
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:56.940]   because all we're reporting
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.120]   is the current market price
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.700]   of this basket of stocks.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:01.880]   And we have no idea
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.580]   who actually made how much money
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.680]   because there is a way bigger
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.420]   derivatives market in place
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.520]   than the value of all the market prices
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.560]   of the companies combined.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.600]   That would be how I would report
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.280]   financial news.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.780]   So a substantial answer to you,
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.880]   Mr. or Miss Moto Jones,
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.440]   I didn't look to see the details.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.020]   I don't think there was an actual name there.
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:25.080]   And that would be my answer to you.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.160]   And so my encouragement to you
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.200]   would be understand your strategy
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.340]   and spend a lot of time learning
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.960]   before you actually do any investing
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.360]   and then figure out
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.820]   what strategies make sense to you.
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.480]   And if your strategy makes sense to you,
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.820]   don't worry about the bear market
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.200]   unless your strategy has
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.100]   in its buildup,
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:45.900]   in its philosophy,
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:47.260]   a strategy for the bear market,
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.400]   in which case you already know that
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.480]   and you never ask me the question.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.180]   I hope that helps.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.780]   Okay, next question.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.940]   I did not expect that one to take an hour,
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.480]   but hopefully it came across clearly.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.660]   And I was thinking a lot about that Monday show,
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.940]   trying to figure out if I did a good job
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.680]   of talking about why I was,
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.200]   I didn't feel like I did a good job on Monday.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.760]   So hopefully this helped to fill in
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.860]   some of your thoughts
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.220]   and understanding a little bit.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.900]   Okay, next question from Steve,
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.100]   Twitter handle at Steve-o-nomics.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:20.960]   And his question,
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.360]   best investment strategy for a young couple
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.060]   looking to buy a house in the next three years?
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:25.960]   Three to five years.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.320]   So Steve,
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.680]   couple answers to this question for you.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.300]   Number one is,
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.160]   I don't have an investment strategy
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.540]   that's going to work.
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.420]   And I'll explain why.
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.860]   And you're probably expecting this answer,
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:38.680]   but I don't know of anything
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.800]   that you can do with money
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.720]   that is going to make a dramatic difference
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.260]   of the return that you get
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.000]   over a three to five year time period
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.740]   for where you're looking to buy a house
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.680]   that involves a financial instrument.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.500]   And there are a couple of reasons for this.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.980]   The one that most people are familiar with,
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.160]   which is absolutely accurate,
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:54.880]   is the matter of time.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.480]   The time horizon.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.500]   So in general,
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.160]   the price you pay
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.960]   to get high returns on your money
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.420]   is in general volatility.
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.620]   If there were no volatility,
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.960]   no ups and downs in the prices of things,
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.240]   then in general,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.460]   then you get a lower return.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:14.260]   So this is why,
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:18.740]   if you look at the highest long-term growth rates
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:20.140]   among asset classes of stocks,
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:21.700]   is among small cap stocks.
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.480]   So small cap meaning smaller companies
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.460]   with a market capitalization.
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.040]   Under a certain dollar amount,
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.640]   which we all argue on what that number is,
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.140]   but let's just ignore it for today.
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:29.960]   Small cap stocks.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.400]   So small cap stocks,
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.940]   you have the most ups and downs
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.880]   because these are the companies
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.820]   that are the most volatile.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.140]   There's a major difference
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.080]   between a brand new technology company
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.840]   with a market cap of $2 billion
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.540]   versus GE,
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.600]   as far as their business plan
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.840]   and the stability of it.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.160]   So small cap stocks among asset classes
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.740]   have a higher rate of return
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.040]   than do, over the long term,
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.260]   have a higher rate of return
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:54.480]   than do large cap stocks.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.580]   But yet they're way more volatile over time.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.060]   So you say,
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:04:59.980]   okay, I get the higher return.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.300]   What about bonds versus stocks?
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.160]   Well, bonds,
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.720]   and we'll go into this in detail on Wednesday
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.920]   with our stocks versus bond explanation.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.160]   Bonds are called fixed income investments.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:09.960]   So in general,
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.600]   you know how much of a payment
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.700]   you're going to get on that bond.
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.280]   Now the bond price is going to wander around a lot
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.280]   based upon the actual current,
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.860]   based upon the interest rates
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.040]   and the changes of the interest rates.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.440]   But you know what you're going to get.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.560]   It's a guaranteed payment.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.280]   And so as long as the company
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.460]   doesn't default on the payment,
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.500]   then you know I've got in place,
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.860]   I've got this amount of money coming in.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:30.120]   So there's a lot lower return,
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.600]   but there's also less volatility
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.040]   if we ignore temporarily interest rates.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.020]   Over the short term,
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:36.900]   interest rates of bonds
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.420]   can bring in dramatic volatility.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.340]   But just ignore that
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.780]   just for the sake of my simple example.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.060]   On the other hand,
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.600]   if you go down to the bank
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.280]   and you buy a CD,
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.640]   they're going to give you a very low value,
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.400]   excuse me,
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.420]   a very low nominal interest rate return.
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:53.440]   But that's a guaranteed,
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.100]   guaranteed growth rate.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:57.460]   There's not going to be any fluctuation in the value
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:58.520]   because it's not traded.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.920]   It's not dependent on interest rates.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.260]   It's not going to be the kind of thing,
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:02.900]   we're not talking about negotiable CDs
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.320]   which can be traded on the market.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.580]   We're only talking about just a traditional bank CD
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.520]   or even a savings account.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.320]   You've just got a very simple value
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.360]   or a money market fund
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.680]   where it's designed to keep the value,
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.880]   the net asset value at a buck a share.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.780]   Then we go in
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.580]   and we've got a very short-term investment.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.060]   So we've got not much return.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.720]   So the first answer as far as
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.080]   why it doesn't really matter,
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.760]   what, and there is no,
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.300]   investment strategy for three to five years.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.200]   And the reason is because
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.300]   three to five years
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.640]   is not in the world of investing.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.060]   Traditionally, you'll hear
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.080]   if you don't have about five years of time,
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.540]   you shouldn't be investing in stocks
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.300]   and things like that.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.800]   That can be a little bit misleading
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.000]   but because, you know,
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:37.940]   even if you've got six years,
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.260]   well, in a year,
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.260]   you'll be in the five-year time.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.440]   So what, should you sell out then?
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.580]   Depends on the situation.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:44.980]   This is very, very individual.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.220]   But the problem with a house
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:47.380]   is that you've got a plan
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.840]   that in three to five years,
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.180]   you're going to need a large lump sum.
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.580]   So in that world,
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.920]   you can't stomach,
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.660]   even if you had,
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.940]   a six-year time horizon
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:56.720]   and you knew that six years from now,
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.060]   I'm going to need this lump sum,
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.680]   I still wouldn't,
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.020]   probably wouldn't invest it in stocks in general
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.520]   because you're looking at a situation
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.600]   where you,
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.280]   you're looking at a situation
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.940]   where you have a lump sum
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.020]   that's due on six years.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.760]   So unless you can put in a strategy,
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.760]   so maybe you could do,
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.860]   maybe you could purchase
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.960]   an individual bond
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.660]   that had a six-year,
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.480]   that had a six-year duration
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.520]   or a specific,
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.460]   it ended in six years.
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:23.660]   So in,
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.480]   bond trading,
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.320]   we call this duration.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.000]   And so maybe you could put in
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.980]   some kind of immunized bond portfolio
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.540]   in place for six years.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.780]   But this is completely inaccessible.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:33.420]   I mean, that would be great
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:33.800]   if you had a couple,
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.640]   you know, a lot of money,
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.800]   but this is completely inaccessible
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.680]   to the average person
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.300]   who's trying to fund this portfolio
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.780]   for $100 a month over time,
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.660]   building it up and finishes out.
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.540]   Let me explain real quick
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.200]   what that means.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.520]   So if you had a lump sum,
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.340]   you could buy
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:47.760]   an immunized bond portfolio.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.920]   And the idea behind
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.160]   an immunized bond portfolio
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.400]   is that you're trying
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.340]   to immunize the bond
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.340]   against a change,
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:53.520]   major change,
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:53.600]   major change,
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.680]   and interest rates.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.640]   And you do this
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.720]   by adjusting the duration
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.460]   of the portfolio
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.960]   such that your exact goal,
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.440]   that you hit your exact goal
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.080]   and you're going to have
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.120]   the money that you need it
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.500]   and the exact goal.
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.900]   A very simple explanation.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:06.800]   We'll go into it in detail
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:07.400]   in another time.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.180]   But this doesn't work
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:10.340]   for an accumulation strategy
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.620]   because if you're saving
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.660]   $500 a month
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:13.480]   towards the down payment
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.020]   on a house
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.020]   or $1,000 a month
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.040]   or whatever it is,
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.860]   you can't buy a $500,
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.620]   you know,
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.340]   new immunized bond portfolio
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:20.920]   every time.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.360]   And your whole portfolio
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.040]   falls apart
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:23.440]   if you,
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.360]   if you're trying to fund it
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.200]   month by month.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.040]   Now you could
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.260]   if you had a huge lump sum now
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:28.580]   and you knew
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.100]   I got a specific expense
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.000]   that's fully due
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:31.800]   five years from now,
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.360]   you could theoretically do it.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.520]   But you're not going to find
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.200]   a trader who's going
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.080]   to set it up for you
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.160]   unless you're going to do
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.120]   that kind of thing yourself.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:38.820]   And I don't know
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:39.620]   how to do it.
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:39.920]   It's just,
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.600]   this is a bond trading,
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.780]   you need a portfolio manager.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:43.900]   And I mean,
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:44.880]   it's not the kind of thing
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.600]   you go on E-Trade
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:45.860]   and say,
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.400]   I'm going to do this.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:46.720]   Could you?
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.460]   I bet you you could.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.480]   I'm not smart enough to do it.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:50.440]   And if you are,
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.040]   come and tell me
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:51.540]   how to do it
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.820]   because it seems
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:53.780]   completely silly to me
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:54.940]   and the numbers are too small.
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:56.300]   You can't afford the advice
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.280]   and that's the kind of thing
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:57.960]   that you would do.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.020]   That's the kind of thing
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:08:59.820]   that would happen
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:01.120]   on an institutional scale
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.400]   if you had a large amount
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.180]   of money that you needed
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.120]   for a specific expenditure.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.380]   So you're in an accumulation
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:07.160]   phase generally
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.100]   if you're talking about
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.120]   an investment strategy.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.440]   And all of the investment
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.520]   strategies that are available
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.980]   to you as a retail investor,
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:14.540]   they're not really going
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:15.840]   to make a big difference.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.720]   And they're not going
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:17.300]   to make a big difference
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.200]   because of the volatility
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:18.940]   first of all.
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:21.080]   So unless you're willing
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.300]   to risk,
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.860]   that five years from now,
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:23.520]   in my example,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.380]   Dow goes from,
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:24.640]   I don't know,
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.720]   maybe it's 25,000
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.520]   five years from now
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.000]   and it goes from 25,000
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:28.820]   to 12,000
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:30.420]   or maybe it's at 12,000
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.260]   five years from now
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:32.400]   and you're going to make it
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:32.860]   on the gain.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:34.440]   This doesn't work.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.460]   You can't invest
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:36.360]   in that period of time
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.660]   because you can't run the risk
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:38.580]   of the money not being there
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:39.440]   when you want to buy the house.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.580]   So what do you do?
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.820]   Well, that's thing one.
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:42.520]   But thing two,
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.380]   here's the other problem
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:44.980]   is that three to five years,
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.700]   rates of return
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:46.220]   are going to make
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.380]   very little difference.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.960]   So let's assume
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:49.600]   that you're going to buy,
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.400]   I don't know where you live, Steve,
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.020]   but let's assume
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:51.680]   that you're going to buy
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.020]   a $200,000 house
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:53.940]   and down here
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:54.600]   where I live,
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.180]   West Palm Beach,
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.300]   that would be basically
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.000]   a starter house.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:57.200]   I mean,
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.860]   somewhere between $150,000
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:09:59.920]   to $200,000 house
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.900]   and so my numbers
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.020]   make sense at $200,000.
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.280]   So let's say $200,000 house.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.840]   So let's assume
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.780]   you're going to put
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.880]   a 20% down payment
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.480]   and you're going to finance
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.160]   80% of it
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:09.940]   under a traditional
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.520]   fixed rate mortgage.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.800]   So in that 20%,
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.660]   you need to accumulate
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:15.400]   $40,000.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.780]   So let's assume,
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:18.720]   let's use the calculator
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.280]   here real quick
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:19.880]   and let's say,
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.440]   okay,
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.040]   let's assume
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:21.980]   that $40,000
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:24.560]   is our future value
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.900]   and let's put in,
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:26.920]   let's say,
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.900]   you said three years,
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.460]   so let's put in
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:29.280]   36 months
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.860]   and let's start
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:31.400]   with nothing
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.600]   and let's say
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.580]   that we're going to use,
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.340]   I don't know what CDs
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:34.920]   are today,
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.540]   let's say we're going
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:36.940]   to use a 2%
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.780]   investment return,
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:39.880]   2% annualized.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.340]   Well,
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.080]   our monthly payment
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:41.460]   that we're going
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:42.060]   to need to save
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:42.760]   to accumulate that
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.100]   is $1,079.
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:45.400]   So we're going to need
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.120]   to save about $1,000
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:46.540]   a month
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:47.660]   under a 2%
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.460]   investment return
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:49.820]   to equal
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:50.420]   the $3,000
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:52.620]   that we want to save.
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.660]   So let's look
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.400]   at the impact
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.120]   of interest rates
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.260]   over a 36-month period.
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:56.860]   So I'm going to change
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.440]   the math here
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.380]   and so now we're going
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.180]   to put in $1,000
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.060]   for our payment,
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.100]   we're going to put in
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.180]   36 for our number
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:02.720]   of periods,
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.680]   we're going to put in
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.800]   a 2% annualized
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.340]   interest rate
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:05.640]   and we're going
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.340]   to start with nothing.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.940]   So if we save
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.300]   at a 2% interest rate
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.820]   over a 36-month period,
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:13.300]   our total value
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:13.860]   that we have
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:14.140]   at the end
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:14.960]   of 36 months
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.960]   is $37,070
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.900]   and the reason
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:18.300]   that's not,
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.400]   we're going to
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.720]   have $37,070.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.340]   So we've got
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:24.480]   $37,070.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.300]   Let's put in
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.380]   a 3% interest rate.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.300]   Now,
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:28.820]   instead of
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.920]   $37,070,
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.580]   we've got
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.260]   $37,620.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.280]   So let's put in
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.780]   a 5% interest rate.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:37.240]   Let's say that
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.780]   you could find
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:38.300]   something over
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:39.220]   the next three years
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.200]   that were really
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:40.640]   going to make
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.220]   a big difference
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:41.700]   for you.
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:42.240]   Well,
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.100]   in this world now,
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:44.200]   the difference
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.160]   between 2%
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.500]   and at 5%,
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.600]   the 5% interest rate
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.740]   is $38,753.
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.340]   So let's subtract
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.340]   38,000,
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.500]   from 38,753,
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.540]   let's subtract
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.120]   $37,070
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.020]   and our answer
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.600]   is $1,683
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.960]   to go from
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.280]   2% to 5%
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.860]   interest rate.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.460]   Now,
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:07.980]   go out
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:08.360]   and look at
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:08.880]   the investment
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.940]   and savings options
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:10.820]   that are available
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:11.360]   for you
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.360]   over a 36-month period
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.880]   and you tell me
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.640]   how on earth
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.180]   you're going to go
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:17.480]   from 2% rate of return
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.720]   to 5% rate of return.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.040]   With any kind
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:21.580]   of guarantees
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.080]   in today's low-rate world.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:23.680]   I don't know
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.140]   if a strategy
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:24.680]   is going to do it
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.760]   with any kind of guarantees.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:26.500]   And when you're talking
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.600]   about saving for a house,
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.660]   you need to look
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:29.840]   at the guarantees.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.760]   So,
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:31.740]   like,
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:32.960]   over this period of time,
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.240]   the difference of 2%
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.240]   versus 5%
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.440]   is a grand total
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.280]   of $1,683.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.440]   Now,
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.560]   let's say that you're saving
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.440]   for a house.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.540]   Does 36 months
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:43.420]   versus 37,
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:44.040]   what is that,
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.300]   37.6 months
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:45.960]   make a difference?
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.780]   36 versus 38 months
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.380]   to buy the house
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.040]   and have your money
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:49.540]   that you need?
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.400]   To make up
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.260]   that extra $1,600?
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.360]   That makes no difference
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:53.760]   at all
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.780]   in your purchase plan.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:56.260]   But it makes all the difference
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:56.840]   in the world
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.100]   if you have the volatility
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:58.820]   associated with
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:12:59.940]   the 5% investment
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:00.900]   and all of a sudden
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:01.640]   now you're expecting
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.520]   to have $40,000
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.400]   and your $40,000
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.560]   dropped in price
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.260]   because of some
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.640]   interest rate fluctuation
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.140]   down to $28,000.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.220]   So,
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.080]   over the short term,
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:12.740]   interest rates
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:13.780]   are almost irrelevant.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.260]   That $1,600
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.560]   is completely irrelevant.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.680]   That's not even the cost
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.400]   when you're talking
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.300]   about buying a house.
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.020]   That's not even the cost
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.700]   of your inspection
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.440]   and your title insurance.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.280]   So,
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.120]   you're better off
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.180]   just simply ignoring
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:28.840]   in general
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.020]   the interest rates
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:30.860]   completely
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:31.820]   and just ignore them
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:33.600]   and go about your life
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.980]   and save the money.
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:37.160]   Now,
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.140]   you do the best you can.
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:38.740]   So,
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:39.860]   toss that money
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:41.920]   in a money market fund.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.300]   Great.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.240]   That should work.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.280]   Now,
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.340]   here's what can make
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.080]   the major difference.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.260]   What can make the major difference?
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:49.980]   What could you do
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:50.480]   with the money
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.120]   in the meantime
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.900]   that three to five years
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:53.220]   from now
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:53.720]   when you're ready
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.480]   to buy a house
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.160]   could make a much
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.240]   bigger difference for you?
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.060]   So,
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:58.360]   I can't fix the problem
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.240]   of investment returns
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.060]   in three to five years.
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:02.140]   I don't know an answer to it.
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:02.880]   There's nothing
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:03.400]   that makes sense
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:03.980]   other than toss it
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:04.700]   in a savings account
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.540]   and it doesn't make a difference.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:05.760]   Oh,
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.620]   one more piece of math
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:07.360]   I wanted to do on that.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:07.800]   So,
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:08.540]   let's keep exactly
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.800]   that same $1,000.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.360]   Let's go back to 2%.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:11.920]   But now,
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.440]   I'm going to change
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.060]   our period from 36 months
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.180]   and let's go ahead
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:15.680]   and change it
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.220]   to 360 months.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:17.940]   So,
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.000]   we've got 360 months.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:19.500]   So,
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:20.900]   I'm at 2% interest rate
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:21.600]   annualized,
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.020]   360 months
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.620]   and let's start
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:25.080]   with nothing
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:25.780]   at present value
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:26.160]   and let's put
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.480]   the same $1,000 a month
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.020]   into our account.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:30.160]   And let's say
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.440]   at $1,000 a month
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.000]   at 2%,
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.040]   then at the end
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:34.720]   of 30 years,
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.120]   investing $1,000 a month
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:36.800]   at 2%,
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.800]   we would have
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.640]   $492,725.39.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.840]   Now,
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:43.880]   under this scenario,
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.840]   let me raise this
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.000]   to 5%.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.120]   So,
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:46.500]   I'm going to raise
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.200]   my interest rate
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:47.980]   no other changes
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:48.840]   to 5%.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:48.980]   So,
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:49.900]   now at the end
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.360]   from 2% to 5%,
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.420]   now at the end
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.020]   of 30 years,
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:53.400]   we've got
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.840]   $832,258.64.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.560]   Let's say
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.240]   that we raise this
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:00.980]   to 8%
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:02.560]   just for numbers.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.540]   At 8%,
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:04.480]   $1,000 a month,
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.280]   we've got
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.400]   $1,490,359.45.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.400]   So,
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:10.700]   if you want
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:11.100]   to understand
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:11.820]   why you hear
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.700]   every financial planner
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:13.340]   in the world say
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.060]   you can't keep
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:14.420]   your money
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.180]   in a bank account
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:15.740]   when you're investing
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:16.760]   for a 30-year period,
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:17.680]   it's because
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.320]   it costs you
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:18.820]   a million dollars
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:19.880]   to do so.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.360]   At 8%,
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.140]   it's $1,490,000.
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:24.020]   At 2%,
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.440]   it's $492,000.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.860]   And think about
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:27.400]   the difference
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.400]   over a 30-year period
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:28.960]   of what having
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:29.840]   an extra million bucks
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:30.700]   to spend in your life
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:31.460]   as far as what you can
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:32.320]   actually spend that on.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.620]   That makes a huge difference
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.340]   as far as your lifestyle.
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.120]   Whereas,
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.020]   the $1,600 difference
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:44.760]   for your house
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.760]   is only the difference
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.460]   of having to wait
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.540]   another 1.6 months
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:48.200]   to buy your house.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:48.660]   You're not even
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.080]   you just started shopping
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.440]   at 1.6 months.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.320]   So,
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.360]   that's the difference
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.620]   as far as that time horizon.
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.220]   And once you understand that,
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.080]   you don't worry about
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:57.960]   making a big investment
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.740]   return on your house
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:15:59.500]   except for what I'm going
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.180]   to talk about in a second.
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:00.960]   You just don't worry
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.340]   about that.
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:01.940]   Okay.
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:02.560]   Now,
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.600]   what could you actually do?
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.340]   I would say
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.960]   rethink the whole house decision.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.660]   Not rethink it
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:09.520]   in the same
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.800]   in the meaning that
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:10.960]   well,
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.060]   Joshua recorded this show
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:12.840]   on buying a house
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:13.720]   as a bad investment
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.780]   and so therefore
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:15.940]   because I'm buying a house
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.140]   as a bad investment
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:17.920]   then,
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.620]   I should never buy a house
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.580]   and I should have to rent a house
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:21.860]   and now my wife's going to be upset with me.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:22.500]   Not in that way.
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:22.960]   Okay.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.240]   Although,
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.120]   that is accurate
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.420]   if you want to think about it.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.480]   But think about
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.920]   what could I do
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.780]   where I could exercise control
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.540]   over this money
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:31.320]   such that
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.920]   I can be in a really good shape
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.820]   to cover this house
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.200]   in three to five years.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.340]   So, for example,
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:37.360]   do you have any money now?
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.900]   If you have some money,
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:39.620]   what could be
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.720]   the most productive thing
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:41.580]   to do with that money?
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.560]   Could you start
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.760]   a small business on the side
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:44.520]   where instead of saving
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.540]   a thousand bucks a month,
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:46.160]   you could
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.300]   you save for three months,
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.460]   you've got three thousand bucks,
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.560]   you start a small business
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.420]   or some kind of side gig
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.320]   or something that you have expertise in
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.040]   and then
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.660]   because you control that,
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.320]   you take your three thousand dollar investment
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.660]   or your three hundred dollar investment
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.000]   and you grow that business
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:01.580]   to the point
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:02.460]   where instead of it,
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.100]   you can earn
[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.660]   two, three, four thousand dollars a month.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.400]   Well,
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.240]   that would be something
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.140]   that you could control
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.420]   and so now,
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:10.200]   you're in the position
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:10.960]   where instead of saving
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:11.840]   a thousand bucks a month
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:12.340]   for that house,
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.140]   now you're in the position
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.580]   where you have the thousand bucks
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:15.560]   from your daytime job
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   plus you have
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.640]   the three thousand dollars
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.180]   of profit from your day job
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.540]   or the business
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.580]   that you started on the side
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:22.340]   and maybe it's a gamble
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:23.380]   and you might lose the money
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.600]   but maybe it could pay off
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:25.880]   and when it pays off
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.840]   in the form of a business
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.500]   or a skill
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.500]   or something that you've done,
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.060]   then now you've got a situation
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:31.460]   where it's a much,
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.740]   where you can actually have a return
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:34.600]   that you can count on
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.600]   and even though it's a gamble,
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.340]   you know,
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:37.500]   you can predict that return
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.120]   a little bit better.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.860]   Maybe you're in a situation
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.960]   where you're in the corporate world
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.460]   and you're working
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:41.860]   and you're making
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:43.060]   sixty thousand bucks a year
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:44.280]   and you say,
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.760]   I've got a thousand bucks a month
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.660]   to save for a house
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:48.020]   but in my job,
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.600]   I know that I need an MBA.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:49.960]   Now,
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.300]   I don't know if you do your research
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.240]   on this because it varies
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.000]   but in my job,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.120]   I know that I need an MBA
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.760]   and if I had an MBA
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.940]   with my experience
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:58.660]   and if I had a better network,
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:17:59.640]   I could leave the company
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.220]   that I'm at
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:01.200]   and I could go from making
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.600]   sixty thousand bucks a year
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.600]   to making a hundred and sixty thousand bucks a year
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.940]   because I built up a website,
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.380]   I built up a portfolio,
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:10.000]   I became a speaker
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.960]   and did these things.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:12.700]   Well,
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:13.400]   in that situation,
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.600]   I would say do that.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.560]   Take that thousand bucks a month,
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.540]   go down,
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:17.840]   join,
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.160]   join the local Toastmasters Club,
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.560]   become a skilled public speaker,
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.180]   go start buying a book
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:23.140]   and reading a book a week
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.600]   off the personal MBA checklist
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.280]   and go join an executive MBA program
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.920]   and spend your Saturdays in MBA school
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.060]   so that twelve months from now,
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:31.360]   you've got your MBA done
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.220]   and then make sure
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:33.160]   that you're going to,
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:33.500]   you know,
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.220]   to steal Brian Tracy's
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.100]   thousand percent formula,
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:37.400]   make sure that you're spending
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.600]   that thousand bucks a month
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.880]   going to four conferences
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.240]   in your industry every year
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.180]   and take your wife with you
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.260]   and you said young couple,
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:47.480]   so,
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.420]   take your wife with you
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:49.180]   to those conferences,
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:50.560]   schedule your vacation
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.380]   around the conference
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.920]   and go to the widget industry conference
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.400]   in Denver
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.000]   and spend two days before that
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:56.600]   up in the mountains
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.480]   and two days after,
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:57.980]   you know,
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.160]   hanging out in Denver
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.480]   with the Denver people.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.100]   Things like that
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.100]   can actually make a difference.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:04.680]   Now,
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.840]   fast forward three years,
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.120]   you've done what you needed to do
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.040]   to build your career.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:08.700]   Now,
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:09.520]   in that situation,
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.640]   take yourself and go from
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.860]   $60,000 to $160,000
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:14.640]   and I've got an extra
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.060]   $100,000 of income
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:16.960]   that I can play with.
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:18.000]   Guess what?
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.340]   If you'll keep your lifestyle
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:21.580]   and expenses at the $60,000 level,
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.220]   $100,000 of extra income,
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.500]   let's assume you're bad
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.140]   at tax planning,
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:27.800]   so you've got to pay
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.020]   $20,000 of that out in taxes,
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.340]   so let's now say
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:32.120]   you've got $80,000.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.060]   Now you've got an extra
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.940]   $6,667 a month
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.360]   that you can save.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:37.960]   Well,
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.360]   $6,667 a month
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.560]   over the next 12 months,
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.400]   that's $80,000.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.780]   In another six months,
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.620]   there's your $40,000
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.820]   we were trying to get to
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:47.380]   for your house.
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:48.260]   That's your house down payment.
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.840]   So that's how I would think about it.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.760]   There is no good investment strategy
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.380]   over a three to five year period
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:55.280]   that's going to work
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.800]   as far as helping you save the money.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.620]   But if you could come up
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.900]   with some kind of alternative strategy,
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:00.680]   maybe another strategy
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:01.480]   that comes to me is
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:02.940]   maybe instead of buying
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.080]   a single family house,
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.960]   you guys could buy a quadruplex
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.560]   or a duplex
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.440]   or something like this.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.640]   Well, now you go in,
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.500]   you find a good price,
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:11.900]   you get involved in real estate investment,
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:13.180]   you buy a quad,
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.220]   and you've got to come up
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:16.160]   with a higher down payment,
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.160]   so maybe you can build a relationship
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.680]   with a local real estate investor.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.660]   Maybe that person can be a hard money lender.
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:22.820]   You can build a relationship
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:23.660]   with a hard money lender
[01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:24.800]   or someone that will help you out.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.460]   And you can make the numbers work
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.660]   where for the same price
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:28.840]   that you're paying today in rent
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.400]   with the fact that you borrowed the money
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.240]   from a hard money lender
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.540]   or from a local real estate investor
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.380]   who wanted to be available
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:34.460]   and you split the deal with them
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:35.520]   and set up something
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.380]   where you're living
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.040]   in one of these four units.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.020]   And then over a five year period,
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:41.000]   you can live in that unit
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.040]   and then you can manage the quad,
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:43.980]   the quadruplex.
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:45.640]   And over that five year period,
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:46.640]   you can build up
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.060]   the space
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:47.780]   and you can manage the cash flow
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:48.300]   from that
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.240]   to where you buy out
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.080]   the fellow investor.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.240]   He gets his money back
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.160]   with a good rate of return.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.360]   You've got a place to live
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.460]   for the next three to five years.
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:55.760]   And then in three to five years,
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:56.400]   maybe you can make
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.580]   the cash flow numbers work
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:58.860]   where in excess,
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:20:59.700]   you've got an amount
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:00.940]   in excess of the mortgage payment
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.740]   on the investment property.
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:05.000]   In excess of that mortgage payment,
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.480]   you've got the money coming in
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.120]   where you can then turn it
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.540]   and cover your own mortgage payment
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.560]   and have less money
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.020]   that you need to cover that.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.320]   Now, is that possible?
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.180]   I bet you it is.
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:15.700]   Is it easy?
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.560]   Probably not.
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.400]   I don't know if those numbers would work.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.100]   I'm making the idea
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.100]   up off the top of my head.
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:21.800]   But something like that
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.700]   is where I would spend
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:23.660]   my time focusing.
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.380]   Building your skills,
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.060]   building your knowledge,
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:30.340]   figuring out an alternative angle.
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:32.080]   Now, last part to it.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:33.220]   Is there anything wrong
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:34.840]   if you have a job that you like
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.360]   and you live in a place that you like
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.640]   and you're saving the money
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:38.820]   and you're really happy
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:39.480]   with your lifestyle
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.900]   and you don't want to work on the side
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:41.660]   and you don't want to go
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.240]   to four stupid conferences a year
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.420]   and you don't want to go on Saturday
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:45.220]   and waste your Saturday
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:46.100]   on an MBA program
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:46.740]   and you just want to go
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:47.300]   and you just want to save
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.200]   $1,000 a month
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.280]   for the next 36 months
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.000]   to have your $38,000,
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.360]   $40,000 down payment.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.380]   Is there anything wrong with that?
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:55.460]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.060]   There's no inherent virtue
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.080]   in having more money.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:58.740]   It's just that people,
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.920]   if you're listening to a finance show,
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.220]   this is how my ideas work
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:02.920]   to try to figure out
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.240]   what works and what doesn't work.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.620]   So those are my thoughts for you, Steve.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:07.180]   Good question.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:08.280]   Let me know what you think.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.360]   I'd love to know
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.740]   if this advice helps you at all.
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.020]   I want to real quick,
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:14.740]   Robbie Courtney sent me that tweet
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.580]   and I covered it on Wednesday
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:17.420]   but it was kind of
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:18.260]   a different kind of show.
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:19.380]   What financial advice
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:19.880]   would you have given
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.840]   your 18-year-old self?
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.720]   Here's the short and sweet answer.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.460]   On Wednesday,
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:24.500]   I was just thinking through
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:25.560]   some of the lessons
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.280]   that I've learned
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.900]   that I think affect more finances
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.560]   than just what financial advice
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:30.980]   would I do.
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.240]   But my answer to that question
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.240]   is invest in yourself
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.460]   and in your ideas first
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:36.640]   and then look for a strategy
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.740]   that's going to work faster
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:38.800]   than any kind of
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:39.900]   specific market thing.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.940]   If you're interested in investments,
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.640]   go out and get interested in it
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.660]   and spend all your time
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.920]   trading stocks
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.420]   or buying
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:47.420]   and selling investments.
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:49.300]   But you can do that
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.020]   but you're going to be
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:50.820]   a different kind of person.
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:51.740]   You're going to be the kind of person
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.060]   who's obsessed with this stuff
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.160]   and for whom it's fun
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.460]   to sit and read annual reports.
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:57.240]   The best example I'd give you of that
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.140]   is Joshua Kennan.
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.880]   I'd love to interview him
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.320]   at some point.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.320]   If anybody knows him,
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.880]   please ask him for an interview
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:03.780]   and I'm going to send him a note
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:04.680]   and I don't know
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.400]   if he does interviews
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.820]   but he's one of my favorite
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:07.640]   financial writers.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.580]   He writes the
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.820]   About Investing section
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.100]   for the About website.
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:13.040]   He does a great job.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:14.100]   He's got a personal website
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:15.040]   at Joshua Kennan,
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.020]   K-E-N-N-O-N.
[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:16.980]   dot com.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.040]   But the interesting thing
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:18.540]   you'll find
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.180]   is that you'll see
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:22.380]   kind of a very open peek
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:23.820]   into the mind
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:26.020]   of how actual
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:29.340]   investors think.
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:30.380]   And for him,
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:31.260]   his favorite thing to do
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.160]   is sit down with a stack
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:32.900]   of annual reports
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:33.460]   and a highlighter
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:34.600]   and read through annual reports.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.080]   That's not the average person.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.560]   So he gets above average
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.320]   investment returns
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.840]   and he has an above average lifestyle
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.280]   because that's his fun.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.660]   And so you're likely to find him
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:44.320]   at 2 a.m.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.520]   reading investment reports.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.100]   But if that's the case,
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:46.480]   if that's you,
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.140]   go for it.
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:48.560]   Number two,
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.460]   invest in yourself
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:50.760]   and in your ideas first.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.100]   So knowledge,
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:52.820]   skills,
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.360]   focus on that.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.620]   Focus on your knowledge
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:56.320]   and your skills.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.120]   And we know this intuitively
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:58.800]   with college.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.900]   Everyone says go to college
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:00.720]   so you can make more money.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.400]   But what's the philosophy
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.040]   behind that?
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.120]   It's not as simple as saying
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:04.840]   I got a college degree
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:05.580]   so I make more money.
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.900]   There's tons of college people
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.080]   out there making minimum wage.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.880]   But the idea is skills.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.120]   And so traditional people
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:11.300]   would say,
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:12.020]   well, a college degree
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:12.860]   grants you skills.
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.980]   You need to develop
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:14.940]   some kind of skills
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:15.940]   that will create your income.
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:17.120]   Because at the beginning
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:17.640]   of your life,
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.740]   you have unlimited human capital.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.060]   Not unlimited.
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.720]   You have the most human capital
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.500]   you're ever going to have
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:24.920]   and you have no financial capital.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.240]   So you've got to enhance
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.160]   the human capital
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.480]   with the financial capital
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.860]   until the human capital
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:30.800]   is so valuable
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.560]   that you can then transform it
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.500]   into financial capital
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:34.580]   and use the financial capital
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:35.720]   to pay for everything else.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:36.780]   But the connection
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:37.820]   between financial capital
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:38.980]   and human capital
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.920]   is so important.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.100]   So spend the money
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:42.260]   going to the places,
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:43.300]   the classes you need to go.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:43.900]   Spend the money
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:44.820]   gaining the skills
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:45.780]   that you need to gain
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:46.100]   the gain.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:47.700]   Look for a way
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.220]   to find money
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.660]   that you don't have to have.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.640]   So look for a way
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:52.640]   to leverage something.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.960]   So look for a way
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.760]   to leverage your skills
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.540]   and other people's money.
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:59.100]   Whether that's starting a business
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.220]   with investors' money
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.000]   or borrowed money
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:01.600]   or no money
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.300]   because you have skills
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:03.540]   and you can bootstrap the thing.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:04.680]   Look for a way
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.700]   to develop artificial equity
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:08.160]   where, so for example,
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.140]   would be maybe
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.020]   you don't have the money
[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:10.660]   to go out and buy
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.840]   a real estate portfolio
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.760]   but you're really invested
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:13.340]   in real estate.
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:14.240]   So you would become
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.160]   a property manager
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:15.620]   and you would be able
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.660]   and you would then leverage
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:18.020]   somebody else's investment,
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:19.260]   somebody else's money
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:20.800]   to then allow you
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.620]   to learn the skills
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:22.220]   that you need to do
[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:23.220]   while you're then saving money
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.140]   so that you can become
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:24.720]   your own investor.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.440]   So now you're leveraging
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.380]   someone else's money.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:28.160]   This is what financial advisors do.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.120]   So a financial advisor
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:30.160]   who's managing assets,
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.240]   I wasn't a millionaire.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.340]   I'm not a millionaire.
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:33.160]   I wasn't a millionaire
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.140]   when I'm managing
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:35.120]   a million dollar portfolio.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.040]   So I'm essentially using
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.100]   the million dollar portfolio
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.340]   to provide for my income.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:41.320]   And so that's what,
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.960]   so I can leverage my love
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:43.620]   and my skills
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:44.560]   with financial planning
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.460]   and portfolios
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.560]   and financial advice.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.140]   I could leverage that
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.280]   using other people's money.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.560]   And so I can kind of develop
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.960]   an artificial equity.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.460]   And that would send my friend
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:55.320]   Jim Collins crazy
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.100]   because he would say,
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.180]   oh, Joshua, that's crazy.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:58.340]   That's unethical.
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:25:59.420]   We'll talk about it sometime, Jim,
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:25:59.940]   if you're listening.
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:00.700]   I hope you are.
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:02.460]   But you could do that
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:03.300]   in any kind of business
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.860]   and there's a lot of options for that.
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:07.260]   Look for a strategy
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:08.400]   that will work faster.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.960]   So don't look at the,
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:10.740]   okay, I'm going to buy,
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:11.660]   this is what,
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:13.560]   I spent years lost in these books
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.100]   of save $100 a month
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:15.380]   and then,
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:15.440]   you know,
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.840]   10% you'll be a millionaire
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:17.320]   in the future.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:18.420]   You've got to focus
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.400]   on building a financially
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.240]   valuable skill.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.260]   Then you've got to focus
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.100]   on investing that
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:23.440]   with some kind of extreme option
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.320]   while you have the time
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:25.860]   and flexibility.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.520]   Follow Money Mustache's strategy
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.920]   of get financially independent
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:29.760]   by the time you're 30.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.140]   Work your tail off,
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:32.180]   live like a college student
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.180]   from 18 to 30,
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:34.260]   and then you'll be a millionaire
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:35.040]   and then you can live
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:35.540]   like a millionaire
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:36.300]   the rest of your life
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:36.880]   because you've built
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:37.560]   these skills up.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.340]   Follow that strategy
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:40.520]   or follow the strategy
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.280]   where you lay it all
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:41.660]   on the line
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:42.300]   and build a business.
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:43.920]   There are so many
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:44.820]   alternative strategies.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:45.420]   Look for a strategy
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:46.640]   that's going to work faster
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.640]   that's also going to apply
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.820]   to your goals.
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:53.560]   There's nothing wrong
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.000]   with going kind of
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:56.940]   the traditional route
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:58.500]   if that's what you're into.
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.140]   So that would be
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:01.040]   my short, again,
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.900]   answer to Robbie.
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.340]   Last question,
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.760]   or two more quick questions.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.960]   Miriam,
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.680]   screen name,
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:09.360]   or Twitter name,
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.920]   MoyPMTO,
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.440]   so Miriam Ortiz-Epino
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.120]   writes the question,
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:14.560]   what is the most
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.400]   complicated thing
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:15.860]   in your day?
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:17.000]   Frankly,
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.880]   it was last week,
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:19.820]   it was trying to figure out
[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:20.780]   how to get my Skype thing
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:21.780]   to work with my computer,
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:23.240]   it was a bad computer connection,
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.440]   but I think I might have fixed that.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.160]   I'm still trying to get
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:25.740]   another solution
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:26.400]   that'll work better.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.800]   But the most complicated thing
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.180]   in my day
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.180]   is trying to figure out
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:29.900]   how on earth
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:31.500]   do you take this complicated stuff
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:32.260]   and make it simple?
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:33.860]   And I struggle with it
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:34.540]   because I really,
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:36.060]   I feel it's one of my skills,
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:37.520]   but it's an underdeveloped skill,
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:38.840]   which is why I'm doing the podcast,
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.340]   is I want to try to figure out
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:42.000]   how do I take these complex
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.700]   things like investments
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:45.380]   and portfolio management
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:47.100]   and complex topics
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:48.160]   and make them simple?
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.520]   I think this has probably made
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.560]   one of the biggest differences,
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.160]   and I made fun of Warren Buffett earlier
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.020]   as people consider him
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.040]   to be the god of investing,
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.100]   but the thing that he is so good at,
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.220]   which is amazing,
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:01.240]   is he takes a complex concept
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:02.840]   and he boils it down
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.380]   into this very pithy
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:07.360]   kind of down-home aphorism.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.480]   And so he's viewed
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.280]   as the lovable Uncle Warren,
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.620]   and the wisdom
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:12.380]   in this little aphorism
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:13.760]   is so great.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.560]   I would really want
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.260]   to develop that.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.640]   So I think a lot about
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.480]   how can I do that,
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.380]   and I want to develop that
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.580]   with the podcast going forward.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.600]   Last thought from Wolfgang,
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.040]   and his Twitter handle here
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.980]   is at, probably William,
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:26.740]   WM Thoughts,
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:28.980]   or at WM Thoughts on Twitter.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:29.940]   So Wolfgang says,
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:31.200]   since you probably read
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:32.300]   all good finance books,
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:33.440]   any thoughts on the ideas
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.600]   on the millionaire fast lane?
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.220]   And I flipped through
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:38.080]   the millionaire fast lane
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:38.960]   a couple years ago,
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.080]   and from memory,
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.640]   I think it was basically
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:44.340]   the idea is avoid the slow lane
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:45.340]   and get to the fast lane.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.160]   And basically,
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.460]   look to how to become wealthy
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:49.460]   faster than what
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:50.280]   you're originally told.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.480]   I just went and bought
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:52.220]   the Kindle version,
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:53.780]   and so Wolfgang,
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:54.700]   I will read it again
[01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:57.620]   and do a comment on it.
[01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:58.800]   I'll do a book review on it,
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.580]   and I'd love to interview him.
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:02.160]   I think from my memory,
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.820]   I really liked his,
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.540]   I really liked what he had to say,
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.040]   and it lines up
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.300]   with my own experience.
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:10.260]   If I'm remembering
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:11.040]   the book correctly,
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.580]   he talked a lot in the book
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.060]   about the idea
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:15.160]   of build out a business,
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.360]   build out something
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.620]   that's actually going to make you money
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:18.780]   a lot faster than,
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:21.240]   a lot faster than the idea
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.960]   of work a job you hate for 40 years.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.280]   And this is kind of the common theme,
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.080]   and there's lots of ways
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.360]   to solve this nut.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.020]   So we'll see.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:28.920]   I will read it again.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.640]   I think, I really think I liked it,
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:31.400]   and I've seen other people
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.400]   make really positive reviews on it.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.780]   So I will check it out,
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:36.000]   and I will read it,
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.060]   and I will report back.
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:38.560]   And if anyone knows MJ DeMarco,
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.680]   I always love,
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.660]   I always love reviewing
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:43.280]   or reading books like these,
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:44.620]   but it's always a challenge
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:45.300]   because here's the thing.
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:46.460]   When you're trying to write a book,
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.580]   even in, you know,
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:49.760]   I'm even doing it with my podcast,
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.260]   you're trying to be different,
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.600]   and you're trying to kind of,
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:53.320]   you're saying,
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.760]   pay attention to me.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:55.660]   Why do you think the name of the show
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:56.840]   is Radical Personal Finance?
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:57.420]   I'm trying to say,
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:58.460]   pay attention to me,
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:29:59.000]   pay attention to me,
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:29:59.620]   I've got a plan.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:00.920]   But the reality is,
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:01.280]   is that,
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.320]   and here's what drives me nuts
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.220]   about many books,
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:04.420]   and this is not specific
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:05.280]   to Millionaire Fastlane,
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:05.820]   I don't know,
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.080]   but the reality is that
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:08.340]   everybody's got a philosophy.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.020]   And so everyone's got,
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:11.200]   here's what you need to do.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.720]   And the better version,
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.340]   which is not nearly as saleable,
[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:14.680]   is,
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.000]   here's what I have done,
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.480]   and what I think is a really good plan,
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.380]   and I think you should,
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.080]   I think that you should consider this.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.880]   And if,
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:22.920]   because,
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:25.600]   if my memory is right
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.580]   on Millionaire Fastlane,
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.300]   the idea being,
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:27.960]   start a business,
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:28.540]   and that's better,
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:30.160]   I think it's absolutely true.
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:30.880]   The thing I've noticed
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:31.720]   in financial planning
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:33.400]   is I look back,
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:33.980]   and I think,
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:34.600]   you know,
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.840]   I wish that my advice
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:36.920]   to some young people
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:37.700]   would rather be,
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:37.980]   you know,
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:38.740]   go start a business.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:39.980]   But the problem is,
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:40.860]   is that if someone is not
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:41.340]   an entrepreneur,
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:41.920]   and they're not
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.080]   entrepreneurial focused,
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.680]   I, as a financial advisor
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:45.180]   in the past,
[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:46.680]   I couldn't say to the person,
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:47.180]   here,
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:47.960]   go start a business.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:48.660]   What kind of business?
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.240]   If the person didn't come
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:50.600]   and say,
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:51.280]   I'm thinking about
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:51.940]   starting the business,
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:52.320]   what do you,
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:52.800]   how do you,
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:53.420]   what do you think?
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:54.540]   Then going and starting
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:56.000]   a business wasn't the right way.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.020]   So all these books
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:58.040]   are really good
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:58.820]   for inspiration,
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.940]   and kind of helping people
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:02.140]   to see the ideas
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:02.680]   and the things
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.240]   that are there.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.240]   And if,
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.400]   and if he's saying
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:06.520]   in the Millionaire Fastlane
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.160]   that,
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:08.060]   that the people
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:09.300]   who really build wealth
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:09.840]   over time
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.280]   are the ones
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:10.900]   who own a business,
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:12.280]   I think that's true.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:12.520]   You know,
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:13.000]   there's no one,
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.140]   like I said in a previous show,
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:14.580]   there's no one
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:15.320]   in the Forrest 400
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.100]   who got there
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:17.960]   by investing $100 a month
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:18.500]   in their IRA.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:19.360]   It just didn't happen.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:20.740]   There's people there
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:21.000]   that got,
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:21.800]   built a business.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.780]   So everyone's got their own,
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:24.200]   their,
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.400]   has their own
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.040]   kind of twist on it.
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:27.680]   And that's why
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.820]   I encourage reading so widely,
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:29.460]   and that's what I hope
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:30.220]   the show will bring,
[01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.220]   is that each day
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:32.000]   it's something different.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:32.840]   And in one day,
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:33.200]   it's,
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:33.900]   you know,
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:34.680]   you'll often see,
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:35.560]   I'm looking here
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.080]   on the Amazon,
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.700]   on the Amazon page
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:39.260]   for the book,
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:40.920]   and if you have the idea of,
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.600]   he has the idea in his book,
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:43.600]   don't live within,
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.560]   live your means,
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:45.520]   expand your means.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.500]   But then he also says,
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.980]   live within your means.
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:49.320]   So is this true?
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:49.740]   Yes.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:50.060]   You know,
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:51.000]   can you get rich
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:51.960]   living without your means?
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:52.400]   Maybe,
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.220]   if your business goes.
[01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:55.420]   Can you get rich
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:55.900]   if you take,
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:56.900]   so let's say that,
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:57.440]   you know,
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.660]   your income is $60,000,
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:00.360]   but you spend $100,000
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:02.200]   and the extra $40,000
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.220]   above your means
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:04.280]   is borrowed money
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.260]   to invest in your business.
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:06.280]   Can you get rich doing that?
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:06.780]   Absolutely.
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:07.580]   Now,
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:08.920]   annual income $60,000,
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.660]   annual expense is $100,000,
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:12.680]   and you spend the extra $40,000
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:14.540]   going and buying
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:15.560]   fancy cars
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:16.740]   and filling up a garage
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:17.980]   and you have it all on payments
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:19.800]   and the cars are destroying the value.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:20.680]   Can you get rich doing that?
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:21.840]   Absolutely not.
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:22.900]   So,
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:23.780]   live within your means
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:24.580]   is very important,
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:24.980]   but yet,
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:25.840]   are there lots of people
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.680]   who have made money
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:27.760]   that are,
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:28.960]   are there lots of people
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:29.780]   who have made money,
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:30.760]   you know,
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:31.660]   living beyond their means
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:32.820]   by investing in businesses?
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:33.340]   Yes.
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:34.520]   It looks like here,
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.140]   he also says,
[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:35.800]   build,
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.400]   you know,
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.240]   increase your means.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:39.840]   So,
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:40.920]   is it true that,
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.060]   is it true that,
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:43.780]   that it's very powerful
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:44.520]   to have a strong
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:45.960]   goal of,
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:46.220]   hey,
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:47.200]   I really want to drive
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:48.620]   the Ferrari or Lamborghini,
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:49.160]   so therefore,
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:49.980]   that's going to drive me
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:50.500]   to work hard?
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:51.700]   I think that's absolutely
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:52.600]   a valid strategy.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.640]   But is it also
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.620]   a valid strategy to say,
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:55.280]   I don't really care
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:55.980]   about that stuff
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:56.920]   and I just want to save
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.100]   a majority of my income
[01:32:58.100 --> 01:32:59.320]   and do something I enjoy?
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.660]   They're all valid.
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:01.380]   So,
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:02.180]   that's the difference.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:02.900]   And so,
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:03.120]   again,
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.140]   I won't go on too much
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:05.000]   about without reading it.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:05.760]   I bet you,
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:06.900]   I think I liked it
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:07.500]   when I read it,
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.820]   but I will read it again
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.560]   and we'll report back to you.
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:11.260]   And if I can get
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:12.900]   MJ DeMarco on the show,
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:13.900]   I would love to do that.
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:14.280]   So,
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:15.060]   if any of you know him,
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:16.540]   please give him a heads up
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:17.140]   and let him know
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:17.980]   that I'd like to talk to him.
[01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:19.760]   And we're growing day by day.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.800]   And so,
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.060]   I hope to bring you
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:23.760]   lots of really awesome authors
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.740]   as time goes on.
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:25.660]   I hope to bring you
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:26.800]   lots of really awesome people
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:27.460]   and expose you
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:28.260]   to lots of ideas
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:29.680]   with the idea being
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:30.680]   that you can take
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:31.420]   this information
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.620]   and you figure out
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:33.400]   what you should apply
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.020]   to yourself
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:34.940]   and to your own life.
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.760]   That's our Friday show
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:37.240]   for today.
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:37.860]   Again,
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:38.100]   today,
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:39.000]   Friday,
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:39.680]   July 11.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.880]   I hope you've enjoyed it.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.660]   You let me know
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:43.360]   if you give me feedback
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:44.260]   as far as what you like,
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:44.860]   what you don't like.
[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:45.560]   Today was obviously
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.840]   pretty free-spirited,
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.080]   kind of going on a rant
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:48.820]   and talking off the top
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:49.440]   of my head a lot.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.340]   I don't know
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:51.000]   if this is better.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:51.460]   I don't know
[01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:54.380]   if the well-planned-out shows
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:55.280]   with my outline
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.640]   works better.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:57.980]   I'm learning as I go.
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:58.260]   So,
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:33:58.940]   you let me know
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:33:59.380]   if you like.
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:00.560]   I love these questions,
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:00.780]   though,
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:01.280]   because they give me
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:01.780]   an opportunity
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:02.840]   to answer some of the questions
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:03.940]   that I know you're thinking of.
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:04.840]   And I appreciate
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:05.440]   those of you
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.400]   who are in the audience now.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:06.700]   I mean,
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:07.700]   it means the world to me
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.620]   that you're taking time
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:10.440]   out of your schedule.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.660]   And if you're hearing this,
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:11.840]   I mean,
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.520]   this is an hour
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:13.500]   and 33 minutes
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:14.500]   into a show
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:16.320]   and that you've taken time
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:16.980]   in your schedule
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:18.200]   to listen to me,
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:18.520]   I mean,
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.780]   I thank you for that.
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:20.440]   And I hope
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:20.980]   that you've gotten
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:21.620]   great value
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.400]   from the content
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:23.980]   that we've covered.
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:24.720]   Remember,
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:25.960]   financial planning
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.640]   is so personal.
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:26.900]   So,
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:27.840]   I want to give you ideas,
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.740]   but at the end of the day,
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:29.400]   you know,
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.040]   Steve,
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:30.400]   I don't know
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:30.980]   what you should do.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:31.500]   I don't know
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:32.320]   what you should do
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:32.680]   because I don't know
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.160]   your life.
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.080]   But that's where
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:34.880]   you should go
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:35.660]   and find someone
[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:37.000]   and find a group of people.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:37.660]   Find a mentor.
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:39.220]   Find a group of friends.
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:40.260]   Find a mastermind group.
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:41.140]   Get involved
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:41.960]   in online forums
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:42.580]   where you can share
[01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:43.200]   more ideas
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:43.460]   about,
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:44.040]   about specifics.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.540]   Because like I laid out
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:46.140]   a couple of,
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:46.800]   three strategies
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.640]   that I would think of,
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.460]   but then again,
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:49.360]   none of those strategies
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:50.380]   could be appropriate to you.
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.040]   So,
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:52.120]   that's what I hope to do
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:52.500]   in the show
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:53.140]   is kind of lay out
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:54.320]   how I would think about it.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.200]   And at the end of the day,
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:56.520]   you go call a professional
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.060]   or call a friend
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:34:59.240]   and see if you can come up
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:34:59.580]   with something
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:00.440]   that'll be better for you.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.820]   Thanks for listening, everybody.
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:03.140]   Come by the blog.
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:03.700]   Give me a comment.

[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:09.440]   So,
