[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:10.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.800]   - Welcome to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.600]   Each week our audience gives us tons of questions
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.800]   and Duncan and I try to get on here,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.800]   provide some context, research data,
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.560]   maybe a few charts, help people out.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.840]   Duncan, our Google doc is full of questions.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.760]   So many so that I don't know how we're gonna get to them.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.800]   So we might have to do a Jim Cramer lightning round
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.640]   at one point.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.480]   - Yeah, yeah, I like that.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.960]   - And you're just gonna have to put a timer up,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.720]   60 seconds and go.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.560]   Remember if you have a question,
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.160]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.680]   I've been writing about finance for almost a decade now
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.520]   and there's certain topics
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.600]   that always get people worked up.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600]   Taxes is one of them.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.840]   We've mentioned that on the show before.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.880]   The Fed, you know, my colleagues at the Fed
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.880]   always get people worked up.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.200]   Crypto of late.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.600]   Anything with government policy
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.680]   and how it impacts the economy or individual households.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.800]   Here's one that surprises me.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.520]   Individual bonds versus bond funds.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.160]   People have very strong opinions about this.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.680]   Maybe we'll get a question about that someday.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.520]   And finally, housing.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.840]   And I think that's because housing is by far
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.480]   the most emotional of all assets you can own.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.520]   And also 2/3 of the country owns a home.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520]   So people like have a vested interest there
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.320]   and they have personal experience there.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.200]   So I've been writing about the housing market a lot
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.680]   over the past two years 'cause it's been so crazy.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.520]   So we got a few housing questions today.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.800]   So I wanted to actually go through it.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.440]   I pulled out like five of the craziest,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.120]   five of Ben's craziest housing facts
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120]   of the last few years that I've written about.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.680]   Number one is we haven't built enough houses.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.280]   So in the 1970s, there was like 200 million people in the US
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.880]   and we were building like two million homes a year.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.080]   There are now 330 million people in the US.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.560]   Last year, there was less than 1.3 million homes built.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.840]   The whole 2010s was the lowest amount of homes
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.560]   we've ever built in a decade.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.720]   If you wanna know what's happening there,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.560]   that's probably why.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.760]   Here's another interesting one.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.800]   In 1944, after the Great Depression,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.760]   there was 114 new single-family homes started to build.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.360]   By 1950, it was 1.7.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.200]   So after the World War II,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.040]   they just built a ton of homes
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.480]   and the government made it happen.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.360]   Not really happening this time.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.400]   Here's a more recent one.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.320]   In 2015, the summer of 2015,
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.400]   there was 1.2 million homes across the whole country
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.240]   for sale.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.480]   How many do you think it is now, Duncan?
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.600]   - Wait, how many?
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.520]   - So there were 1.2 million homes for sale,
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.280]   like listed homes in 2015.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.240]   - I'm guessing that today it's like 500.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.200]   - It's like 250,000.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.040]   - Yeah, no.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.160]   Yeah, it seems like nothing, basically.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.240]   I looked the other day around the New York City area
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.360]   and it's insane how few places are on the market.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.200]   - Basically.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.040]   All right, I did some research.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.320]   This is from the US Census data.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.400]   They look at new houses built in the 1970s and today.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.560]   So I think it was like 1973.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.440]   50% of new homes had no air conditioning in them.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.600]   By 2015, it was just 7%.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   In 1973, 40% of all new homes had 1.5 bathrooms or fewer.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.160]   That's just 4% of homes today that are new.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.720]   In 1973, the median square footage of a house
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.240]   was 1,500 square feet.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.600]   Today, it's 2,500 square feet.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.000]   - So our standards are going up.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.840]   - Yes.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.680]   - We need more space. - Standards are going up.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.560]   So if you wanna know one of the reasons houses
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.760]   are more expensive is because they're bigger
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.200]   and better these days.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.040]   Obviously, then it's not everything.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.360]   - You gotta have room for that Peloton, you know?
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.440]   - Yes.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.200]   And by the way, moving one of those is a beast.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.600]   They are very heavy.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.840]   - Oh, I didn't realize that.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.960]   - I got mine delivered in April, I think, of 2020.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.040]   The pandemic was starting and they were like,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.560]   "Here, we're putting it next to your garage
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.680]   "and we're out of here."
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.520]   It's like, "We don't want anything."
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.240]   Otherwise, they used to put it in.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.080]   So me and my wife had to carry it down to our basement.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.560]   It was very heavy and awkward, not easy.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.120]   All right, here's one for you.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.120]   2004 to 2006, the height of the housing bubble, right?
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.880]   The subprime mortgage lending.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.320]   Roughly one quarter of all mortgage originations
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.080]   had credit scores of 659 or less.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.280]   So not great credit scores.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.320]   You know, I like to keep that credit score up.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.560]   From 2019 to 2021, just 6% had that.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.800]   So that subprime thing is completely gone.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.560]   So that's one of the scarier aspects of this
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.080]   if you're a first-time home buyer.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.480]   The fact that people's finances,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.440]   it's not like they've been going crazy.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.080]   People who are getting mortgages are doing so
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.240]   with good credit scores and good finances.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   So their finances are in good shape.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.400]   So it's not like you can hope for all these people
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.080]   to all of a sudden foreclose on their house or something.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   Like people who are buying houses have the means to do so.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.200]   Finally, here's one that kind of blew my mind.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.280]   The housing market bottomed in 2012
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.160]   from the great financial crisis, blow up all that stuff,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.440]   the housing bubble that popped last time.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.560]   At that point, people had $6 trillion of equity
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.520]   in their home.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.800]   Right now, people have $26 trillion of equity
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.640]   in their house.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.560]   We've added $20 trillion of equity
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.040]   in about 10 years, basically.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.840]   Just a massive amount of wealth.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.000]   - It's a good time to be a homeowner.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.160]   - Yes, a good time to be a homeowner.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.080]   And the thing is, that actually builds wealth
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.960]   for the middle class too,
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.480]   which that's their main source of wealth for a lot of them,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.320]   which is crazy.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.000]   So all right, that's Ben's five crazy facts about housing.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.240]   Maybe we could have done a little graphic or something.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.680]   - We could have done a graphic with sound effects
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.520]   and stuff, yeah.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.340]   - All right, next time.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.480]   Let's get to a question on housing here.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.080]   - Okay.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.600]   So first up, we have what percentage
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.520]   of a first-time homebuyer's net worth
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.160]   should they put down on their first real estate purchase?
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.080]   Do you advise buying property before getting,
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.160]   hold on, so it's kind of two very different parts.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   So the second part is, do you advise buying property
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.940]   before getting married to hedge against
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.560]   the unintended event that you could get a divorce
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.240]   in the future and you want to be able to stay
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.040]   in the property you've owned since before marriage?
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.760]   So a real romantic one.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.600]   - First of all, if you do do that second part,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.080]   don't tell your future spouse that you bought the house
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.320]   in the event of them.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.020]   I'll get to that one in a minute.
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.300]   I would say, first of all, with that part,
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.760]   I don't know that you'd, I mean, sure,
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.560]   if you want to buy it for investment property,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.440]   but buying a house and then potentially having
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.820]   your future spouse not like it,
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.320]   that could lead to problems down the road.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.700]   So I would say, if you're trying to get ahead of that,
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.520]   and if that's your thought process going in,
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.440]   you're probably gonna get divorced anyway, I think.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.280]   I don't know.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.320]   - I feel like you're starting off on a bad note.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.680]   - Yeah, that's your Great Depression there,
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.560]   because when you get divorced,
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.080]   you lose half of your net worth, so.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.440]   All right, so there's this personal finance rule.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.280]   I don't know who came up with it.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.960]   It's called the 50/30/20 rule.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.600]   And it basically states you spend 50% of your money
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.940]   on necessities, this is your budget,
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.440]   housing, transportation, healthcare, food, et cetera.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.120]   30% on wants, so that's dining out,
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.680]   travel, entertainment, clothes, et cetera.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.440]   20% on savings, so that's retirement,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.160]   emergencies, debt repayment, that sort of thing.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.300]   Obviously, these can vary based on where you live.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.200]   Some people might not pay as much on transportation
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.960]   if they live in a big city and don't have a car.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.800]   Then you're probably paying more for rent or housing,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.380]   that sort of thing, but those are the general guidelines.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.120]   I don't know if you necessarily need to look at it
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.360]   in terms of net worth, like I have a certain net worth,
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.600]   what percentage should my house be?
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.840]   'Cause especially when you're first starting out,
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.800]   your net worth is probably gonna be relatively low.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.080]   I think you think about it in terms of
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   can I service this debt, can I handle the property taxes
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.520]   and insurance on it, and can I handle the maintenance
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.080]   that's involved in a house?
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.080]   You also, one of the things I did,
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   I moved from an apartment when I first got a house.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.920]   One of the things I never realized
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.120]   is you have to buy a lot of crap for a house.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.720]   All the lawn care stuff, shovels and rakes
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.880]   and wheelbarrows and ladders and all this stuff
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.260]   that you don't need when you have an apartment.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.460]   You have to furnish all the rooms.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.600]   We took our time to do that,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.840]   but you have all these different bedrooms
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.280]   and you have to buy sheets and towels and all these things.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.080]   Owning a house is expensive, so can you handle all that?
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.160]   I also think how long do you plan on living in the home?
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.720]   I'd say a minimum five to seven years,
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.080]   because otherwise you pay realtor fees when you move in,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.400]   you pay closing costs, you're paying insurance,
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.880]   so my rule of thumb is kind of,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.460]   I tell people don't buy a starter home.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.240]   That may have looked like bad advice the past few years
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.160]   'cause you bought one, you got a ton of equity in it,
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.360]   but let's say you have a $350,000 mortgage
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.920]   at a 4% interest rate.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.040]   In the first three years of that loan,
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.400]   2/3 of your monthly payments are gonna go to interest
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.640]   and only 1/3 is going to principal,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.060]   so you're not really building much equity
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.160]   in terms of your payments.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.000]   So if you're living in a house for a couple years,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.040]   so my whole thing is make sure you live there
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.440]   a minimum of five to seven years.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.520]   And then I think you have to figure out
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.440]   how comfortable you are,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.520]   like how much you're comfortable spending,
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.480]   because if you go to a lender,
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.020]   and I would advise on at least talking to a couple lenders,
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.320]   to see what they're willing to give you, right?
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   Because they might give you a range.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.880]   We can go to this high and start at this level.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.000]   You have to figure out like,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.400]   do I want my housing to be 50 or 60% of my cost?
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.320]   Or can I settle on a house that's much cheaper?
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.360]   Obviously, right now, it's gonna be hard
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.720]   to have a choice in the matter,
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.760]   but I don't think you think of it in terms of net worth.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.200]   I think you would think in terms of,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.120]   is this a debt I'm willing to service,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.280]   and maybe can my income grow to meet that debt
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.200]   in the coming years?
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.840]   'Cause I think that's one of the great parts
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.960]   about a fixed rate mortgage
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.160]   is that technically you can grow into it over time.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.000]   - Do you think, is it a flawed assumption?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.200]   I feel like a lot of people think,
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.000]   oh, I can't get more than I will be comfortable
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.760]   with paying back.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.760]   Is that like a false premise to base your home buying off?
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.880]   - I don't know, because I mean,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.240]   how many people really live in their home for 30 years
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.080]   and pay it off?
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.640]   And how many people end up refinancing
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.840]   and extending that loan?
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.160]   And I think there's, so a lot right now,
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.400]   the biggest worry is,
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.160]   mortgage rates are getting back to like 5%,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.240]   which does seem worrisome,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.720]   especially with housing prices so high.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.120]   Your monthly payment is gonna be way higher.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.920]   I mean, are we gonna see 3% mortgage rates again
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.840]   in three or four years after the Fed lowers rates
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.240]   and we go into a recession?
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.640]   Probably, I mean, I don't wanna like,
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.480]   don't quote me on this, but--
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.400]   - Is that a call?
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.800]   Should we timestamp that?
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.120]   - I mean, guess what?
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.840]   Do you really think the government's gonna be allowed
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.120]   to relieve rates at 5% or 6% for an extended period of time?
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.720]   I would be shocked if mortgage rates
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.960]   aren't at 3% again in the future.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.620]   So I think it's something you can,
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.580]   I mean, people in the '80s,
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.980]   my dad's first mortgage was like 12 or 13%,
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.820]   and then they refinanced all the way down.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.080]   So yeah, think of it in terms of long-term,
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.940]   but I think if you're thinking 30 years,
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.500]   it's, for most people, that's probably unrealistic.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.180]   - Cool, good advice there.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.020]   - Let's do another one.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.220]   - And yeah, one that,
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.260]   people have commented on Animal Spirits recently
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.620]   that you guys are really depressing them
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.500]   about like their home ownership prospects.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.220]   - I really feel for people because it's luck.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.660]   Like if you would have started your housing hunt
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.980]   24 months ago and got a house,
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.460]   you're doing in fantastic,
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.340]   you're in a fantastic position financially.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.900]   If you're starting now, you're in a world of pain.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.440]   - Right.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.440]   Okay, so up next we have a question from,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.780]   oh, I don't see a name.
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.260]   Okay, so I'm 35-year-old, about to have my first child,
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.980]   born and raised around Grand Rapids,
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.340]   and I moved to Boise after grad school 10 years ago,
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.340]   bought a small house in a desirable neighborhood
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.720]   shortly thereafter.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.420]   The Boise housing market has boomed.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.660]   I've been slowly purchasing real estate
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.060]   and have two cashflow properties in Michigan,
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.900]   as well as two in the Boise area.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.080]   I would love to continue to invest in rentals
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.380]   or venture out into something bigger like storage units
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.660]   or apartment complexes in the future.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.640]   I'm currently close to closing on a cash out refinance
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.460]   on my personal home, and this brings me to my question.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.660]   This is a really long one, so we had to do a two-part.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.540]   I owe just north of $100,000, bought for 176,000 in 2012,
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.340]   and my appraisal came in at $822,000.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.160]   So, 4.5 times their money,
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.100]   which allows me to acquire up to $375,000 in cash
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.980]   at 60% LTV with the idea to reinvest
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.780]   the vast majority of the cash.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.520]   Our incomes have increased enough
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.220]   that the increase in mortgage payment is not an issue.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.860]   I feel that I'm on track for my goal of retiring early,
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.380]   hopefully in my 50s.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.780]   What would you recommend putting that money into?
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.100]   I will certainly be funding a 529 with some of it,
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.720]   as well as continuing to look at local real estate,
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.520]   but don't want to waste this very unique opportunity.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.820]   I have to be honest, I have no idea
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.860]   like what's in that stuff, is LTV, that kind of stuff.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.620]   - Okay, LTV is loan to value, basically,
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.040]   because he has so much equity in his home.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.940]   So, this guy's in a very good place financially
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.340]   for a mid-30s person.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.420]   I'm guessing that's because of his West Michigan upbringing.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.660]   He grew up in a flyover state,
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.520]   so he's doing pretty well for himself.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.140]   Listen, we get a lot of questions like this
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.660]   from people saying, "Hey, I have $5,000 or $10,000
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.480]   "or $100,000 or something bigger
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.080]   "because of home equity or inheritance or something.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.920]   "What do I do with it?
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.660]   "I have no idea what to do with it."
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.760]   I want to start this with a story,
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.420]   and I pulled this story from my book,
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.260]   "Organizational Alpha," which is a book I wrote
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.660]   for foundations and endowments people,
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.740]   so no one really read it, actually,
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.380]   besides those foundations and endowment dorks,
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.900]   so I feel like I can talk it
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.100]   because no one actually read that book.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.300]   Went into a meeting a number of years ago
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.340]   with an institutional consultant,
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.580]   and he was kind of a heavy hitter,
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.020]   and he started off the meeting bragging
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.420]   about all his contacts in the industry
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.500]   and all these really heavy hitter investors
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.980]   he's worked with.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.000]   Side note, the kicker was one of his biggest clients
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.240]   was Fred Wilpon, the former owner of the Mets,
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.560]   who, guess who he invested money with?
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.640]   Bernie Madoff, of all people.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.480]   - That's rough. - Anyway,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.760]   this guy walks in, and before he even asks us any questions,
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.980]   he says, "Listen, you need 15% of your portfolio in timber,
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.120]   "and how are we talking on the mezzanine private market,
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.660]   "middle market private equity,
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.280]   "and lower your allocation to LBOs,
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.320]   "and what's your hedge fund manager?
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.180]   "We can get you, and how long is it gonna take you
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.480]   "to move your entire portfolio with us,
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.600]   "and here's what you need to do."
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.440]   And we were blown away,
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.920]   'cause the guy didn't ask us one question
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.780]   about our organization, our time horizon, our risk profile,
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.880]   nothing about our goals, any of that.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.480]   And that's kind of the thinking here,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.360]   is that you need an investment policy
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.220]   to understand what to do
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.040]   with any sort of new money you're thinking about, right?
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.880]   'Cause I think there's plenty
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.240]   of wonderful investment opportunities out there,
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.720]   but they might not be right for you
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.680]   because of your personality, or you don't understand them,
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.700]   or you simply don't have the stomach to invest in them,
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.180]   or they just don't fit with your investment plan.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.620]   So, and there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.160]   You don't have to invest in everything.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.380]   But I think most of the time,
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.440]   the stuff that you say no to is gonna have
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.280]   a far greater impact on your performance
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.760]   than the stuff you invest in.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.740]   But the boring answer here is
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.280]   you need an investment policy, right?
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.280]   So, Charlie Ellis, who wrote the famous book
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.120]   about avoiding investment mistakes,
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.960]   I've mentioned it before, he said,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.060]   "Investment policy does not enjoy much popularity.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.640]   "Almost everyone agrees it is a good thing,
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.200]   "but almost no one does anything about it."
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.280]   Basically, why are you investing in the first place, right?
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.660]   How can you align what you're investing in
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.820]   with your stated goals?
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.560]   Like, how are you gonna measure success in your investments?
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.020]   What are you gonna benchmark it to?
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.300]   What's your risk profile and time horizon?
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.900]   You know, what do you own and why do you own it?
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.500]   Like, these are the things you have to ask yourself,
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.980]   and it's really boring to do all this heavy lifting up front
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.460]   and understand that stuff,
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.860]   but if you just have a pile of money and you say,
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.100]   "I just wanna make some money with it,"
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.180]   or, "I wanna do something interesting with it,"
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.140]   like, that's fine, but if there's no overarching plan
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.300]   in place, then no one's gonna be able to help you.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.280]   If you can't tie your money to your goals,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.940]   it's impossible to offer advice.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:25.920]   So I think that's the first step,
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.460]   is having some sort of investment policy,
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.540]   and if you don't have that or can't figure it out yourself,
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.940]   you're gonna have to probably find a professional
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.620]   to help you work through those goals
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.380]   and understand what you can invest in.
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.660]   - With the real estate stuff, too,
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.900]   we've gotten a lot of questions over the years about this,
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.300]   where it's like, why would you buy an actual property
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.900]   as opposed to a REIT or private REITs
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.580]   versus publicly traded REITs, all that kind of stuff.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.220]   So it seems like with real estate, it's a little confusing
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.260]   'cause there are so many ways that you can get exposure
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260]   with varying levels of--
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.620]   - Yeah, this person has some rentals.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.740]   I think the fact that they know what that entails
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.900]   probably helps a little bit to think.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.740]   That's fine.
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.100]   There's many different paths you can take as an investor.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.260]   If this person's whole investment philosophy
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.100]   is based on real estate
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.020]   and that's what they wanna do more of,
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:10.940]   that's great as long as they know
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.820]   what they're getting themselves into,
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.220]   and obviously they do if they already have
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.060]   a handful of rentals.
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.140]   The problem is if you've never done it before,
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.380]   then you get into it, that can be tricky
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.300]   because it's not as easy as it sounds.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.340]   - Granted, owning an apartment complex
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.140]   sounds like a lot more work than just a single unit place.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.620]   - Yeah, but obviously the ability to raise rent these days
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.220]   is probably looking pretty attractive to some people.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.060]   - True, true.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:32.900]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.980]   - Okay, so up next, question three is a question from John
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.320]   who writes, "I'm 22 and have been an investor
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.640]   "for four years now.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.720]   "Having just started my career,
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.380]   "I'm beginning to build wealth steadily,
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.960]   "but I know little to nothing about taxes or tax law
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.020]   "as it pertains to being an investor.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.200]   "How would you direct young, beginner investors
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.960]   "to start worrying about tax law?
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.340]   "Do you have any big tax-related mistakes you've made
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.940]   "or that you've seen too many people make?"
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.500]   - Look at John, starting out at age 18, that's impressive.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.060]   - That's good to see these young people.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.220]   Well, let's bring in my personal tax advisor.
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.380]   He's been on the show a number of times, Bill Sweet.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.300]   I think he's our-- - The tax man.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.500]   - He's our number one guest here, I think, right?
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.100]   He's like the Ed McMahon.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.220]   - If Duncan's the Ed McMahon, no one's gonna get that.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.100]   - Lately, I've felt like the second Bill.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.980]   It's hurting a little.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.980]   - I've joked that at some point we're gonna license
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.420]   the Beatles song and have that play
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.460]   whenever Bill joins us, the tax man.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.300]   - So, Bill, what's the low-hanging fruit here?
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.560]   My first thought is just take advantage
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.720]   of tax-deferred retirement accounts.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.700]   Is that the simplest thing a young person can do
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.120]   and think about taxes?
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.180]   - Yeah, that is simple, but first I wanna address
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.420]   the elephant in the room, and that is this Midwest bias.
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.420]   Grand Rapids, Boise.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.660]   Duncan, I feel like Ben's just looking down on us
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.540]   from his ivory tower in Grand Rapids
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.300]   at us hardworking New Yorkers.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.960]   - Hey, these questions come straight from the viewers.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.900]   I have nothing to do with it.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.020]   My hands are tied here.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.580]   - But no, but for listener John, good for you, John.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.420]   That is great.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.660]   Most people, like we've talked about before,
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.620]   they hate paying taxes more than they like making money,
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.100]   and so for me, the first step to getting help with tax
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.780]   is admitting you have a tax problem,
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.160]   and if you're a U.S. taxpayer, we all do.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.620]   So for me, Ben, and jump in, please, if you disagree,
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.580]   but I think the gateway drug is doing your own tax return.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.580]   That is something I think every U.S. taxpayer
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.900]   should give a try.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.660]   It doesn't mean that you have to file it.
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.620]   I mean, there are plenty of software platforms,
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.860]   just ask Google, that will help you file a tax return,
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.480]   and what is their harm in taking the inputs,
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.660]   taking your W-2, taking your mortgage document,
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.660]   taking your real estate taxes, taking your HSA docs,
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.700]   and just tinkering around, take a look.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.300]   I would strongly-- - Especially when you're young,
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.220]   and it's not gonna be that complicated,
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.580]   depending on your situation.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.420]   I think when I got my first job--
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.900]   - Hey, guys. - It's '15 or '16.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.460]   Hey, Michael. - Oh, my God.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.300]   - Big fan of the show. - Just wanted
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.140]   to come say hi.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.380]   - Yeah, first time, long time.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.100]   - When I was '15 or '16 and got my first job,
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.220]   my dad wanted me to do this, and he showed me,
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.540]   and obviously, I had two inputs or something, you know?
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.460]   I didn't have much, so I think starting it at 22,
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.460]   you may not have a few more,
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.700]   but it's probably gonna be pretty easy, so I agree.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.420]   Getting to understand that is huge.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.460]   - I think that's the way to start,
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.300]   and you can tinker around with the online platforms, too.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.460]   Take $50,000 of tax-qualified dividend income
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.980]   instead of wages, play around,
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.460]   see what that does to your income.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.900]   Is it a higher or lower tax rate?
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.900]   It's a great, interesting thing to think about.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.820]   What happens if you plug in $12,000 of rental income?
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.660]   Messing out inputs and then gauging
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.020]   is a really great way to kind of test it out,
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.140]   and it really figures out how do you get to know
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.700]   what's actually on that pay stub
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.980]   that we all get every two weeks?
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.820]   Take a look at it.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.660]   What is OSDI?
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.540]   What is SSI?
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.380]   I can explain these things ad hoc,
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.060]   but I think, John, if you have that thirst
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.420]   and you wanna check it out, that's the place where I'd go.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.100]   Most importantly, do not file that return
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.700]   that you just created at a thin air.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.740]   - Bill, I can't believe we've been talking about this
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.580]   for five minutes.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.580]   You haven't mentioned that Roth IRA yet.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.940]   - Well, I've been trying.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.420]   I've been told it's too much.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.100]   The listeners can't handle it.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.780]   But the listener also asked a couple of big mistakes
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:53.620]   that people make.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.220]   I just have four that I would avoid at all costs.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.500]   Number one is early retirement income distributions.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.580]   Do not pay that 10% penalty
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.500]   from an early IRA, 401(k) distribution.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.900]   It's better to have not funded the 401(k)
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.420]   than to have taken a penalty later on.
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.540]   - Right, let that money ride.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.740]   Don't take it out. - Exactly.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.780]   'Cause that money, set it and forget it.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.580]   You're gonna touch it after you're 60.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.780]   Secondly, another big mistake people make,
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.180]   filing a tax extension without making a payment.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.260]   Filing an extension extends the time to file.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.020]   It does not extend the time to pay.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.300]   And so you kind of have to have an okay idea
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.660]   of what you may owe.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.780]   Typically, the most common reason that people extend
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.660]   is 'cause they owe money.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.820]   They don't wanna pay it.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.540]   But that to me is a big mistake
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.900]   because you basically end up increasing,
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.220]   at least doubling the penalty
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.100]   that you're gonna end up paying.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.940]   Number three-- - What do you pay
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.980]   for a penalty if you pay your taxes late?
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:40.820]   I don't even know that.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.640]   I didn't know that. - It depends.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.480]   It depends on the amount.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.900]   At the worst case scenario, Ben,
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.620]   a 20% accuracy-related penalty of whatever's due,
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.260]   and then roughly 5% annualized interest.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.940]   - 20% they charge you?
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.580]   - Yeah, well, for accuracy-related.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.860]   - The US government is like the mob.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.660]   - It ain't good. (laughs)
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.420]   - Yeah, that's like Amex level on this.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.460]   - I would rather have them break my kneecaps, I think.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.460]   - They're not Comcast, which I would argue is actually evil,
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.860]   but it's not far away. - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.240]   - They're more indifferent.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.340]   Number three, I think not filing during a bad tax year.
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.220]   I've seen this a lot where somebody says,
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.020]   "Hey, I took an IRA distribution,"
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.660]   and they just ignore it, right?
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.660]   That's really bad news.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.220]   Even if you can't pay the government,
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.820]   if you just file the tax return,
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.500]   usually cutting your penalty by like 80%,
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.020]   and last but not least,
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.620]   do never, never, never have short-term capital gains.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.720]   There are very, very few reasons to have a short-term gain,
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.460]   and that's on an asset you've held less than a year.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.780]   Tax rates are just brutal there, so don't do it.
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.140]   - Yes, if you're 22, don't become a day trader.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:36.980]   - Amen.
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.280]   - All right, next question.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.140]   Okay, so up next, we have another long one, but a good one.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.340]   We are 43 years old and maxing out
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.640]   our Roth IRA and 401(k) accounts.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.300]   House is completely paid off,
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.420]   we have a good taxable brokerage going,
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.960]   and 529 plans for both our boys, 11 and seven.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.740]   One of the best things we ever did financially
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.060]   was set up a UTMA, no idea.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.960]   - Utma, Utma. - UTMA custodial accounts
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.780]   for our kids when they were babies.
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.960]   They have now grown large enough
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.860]   that I am having to file taxes for them.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.140]   Our 11-year-old's account in 2021
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.420]   had over $5,000 in capital gains from dividends.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.900]   They are mostly in mutual funds,
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.860]   which I now realize
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.780]   are not the most tax-efficient investment.
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.540]   How can I maximize the tax efficiency of these accounts
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.940]   now that they are starting to get big?
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.940]   Will rebalancing to index funds,
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.960]   I'm not sure if they mean ETFs specifically,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.240]   but will rebalancing to index funds be a taxable event?
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.240]   Could I maybe transfer to a 529 plan
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.220]   without tax consequences?
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.820]   - All right, Duncan, we got another one for you here,
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.380]   another abbreviation, the UTMA account.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.260]   - Yeah, yeah. - All right, Bill,
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.100]   let's explain first what an UTMA is,
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.840]   maybe how it differs from a 529
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.460]   and what some of the tax ramifications are here,
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.700]   'cause I've never used an UTMA, actually.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.340]   I've used a 529 and funded it,
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.260]   but I'm not as familiar with the UTMA either.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.940]   - Yeah, so UTMA, just the word salad here,
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.380]   UTMA's a uniform transfer to minors account.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.460]   You may also see them referred to as UGMAs
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.900]   with a G in there, and that just differs on the state.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.220]   What is it?
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.540]   It's an account that you open for your child or grandchild.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.780]   The child owns it.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.660]   That's the important thing to understand.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.500]   But you, the T is you're the trustee.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.960]   And so you as the adult, the parent, whoever funded it,
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.860]   you have control over that account
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.560]   until the child reaches age of majority,
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.740]   which is 18 in most states.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.040]   So UTMAs are pretty powerful in tax planning,
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.740]   but they come with a couple of problems.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.080]   Let's start with the good.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.420]   The good thing is you get $2,000 tax-free.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.520]   So that's the nice thing.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.780]   And this listener, $5,000, they were over the threshold.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.600]   That's no good.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.860]   I wanna talk about that in a second.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.860]   But basically, you get a $1,000 exemption.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.060]   You get $1,000 at the child's rate, usually zero.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.280]   Kids typically aren't earning any money.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.220]   And so that's the benefit.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.060]   - Freeloaders. - But once you go
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.320]   above that threshold. - Freeloaders.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.880]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.220]   So start charging them rent.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.580]   Once you go above that threshold, things start to get ugly.
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.660]   And Ben, I think that's probably the reason that you, me,
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.700]   and I'm guessing Duncan, too, do not have an UTMA,
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:56.780]   and we're not given an UTMA
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.180]   because they're potentially problematic in other ways,
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.020]   which I wanna get to in a minute.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:00.900]   - So if you get too much money,
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.900]   and then they become a hassle, basically.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.020]   - Yeah, basically.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.620]   - I hate having too much money.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.440]   (laughs)
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.280]   These are good problems to have.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.300]   So let's not weave too hard.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.740]   But a couple of problems.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.180]   Number one, I mentioned it before.
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.660]   When the child is 18, that's their account.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.500]   It's no longer yours.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.740]   You no longer have custodial access to it.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.060]   So if the kid walks into the bank
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.260]   or walks into custodian and says,
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.700]   "Hey, I want this money,"
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.260]   and they drive up to the Canadian border
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.980]   and they buy a bunch of maple syrup
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.980]   or whatever you guys do in Grand Rapids these days for fun,
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.620]   whatever the kids are doing, you can't stop them legally.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.620]   I mean, you can yell at them
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.780]   and you can kick 'em out of your house,
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.700]   but you can't stop them from doing that legally,
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.620]   and the bank has to do it.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.460]   So that's problem number one.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.260]   Problem number two comes in taxes.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.980]   Once you go above that $2,050 threshold,
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.480]   which is not indexed for inflation,
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.300]   it's been there as long as I'm aware, back to 1986,
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.980]   then you're stuck paying taxes at your rate,
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.460]   not the child's rate.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.380]   And so until they're actually free and clear
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.060]   out of your house and free of college,
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.380]   which can happen all the way out to age 26,
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.480]   you end up paying the taxes on any gains in that account.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.840]   So unless you're willing to hand over that account
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.740]   to your kid after they're out of your house
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.300]   and after they're done with college,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.220]   you're gonna eat the tax burden.
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.980]   Last problem with these comes into college and financial aid.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.740]   These are the child's assets.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.700]   And so when you go to apply for college,
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.180]   you go to apply for a grant, a needs-based scholarship,
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.460]   or something like that, the EFC contribution
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.100]   is 50% of this per year WAD account can be used for college.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.420]   So it does kinda screw up some college planning sometimes
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.420]   if you're looking for aid.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.700]   And that's why I think the 529
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.740]   is just generally a better account
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.100]   if you can deal with the lack of restrictions.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.380]   - So are they gonna be paying a lot of taxes
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.460]   if they try to roll this over, basically, either way?
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.940]   - Yeah, that was the question listener asked.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.640]   And it's a good question, but ultimately, no,
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.260]   you cannot directly contribute to a 529 from an outlet.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.700]   You gotta pay the tax in order to do that.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.780]   I think, basically, the listener,
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:47.940]   again, these are good problems to have,
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.580]   so let's focus on that, but has one of two options.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.300]   Number one is they eat the tax in one or two years,
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.920]   maybe they spread out over a couple of years,
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.580]   and move the money into a 529.
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.540]   If the 529 account is used for college,
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.020]   it generally comes out tax-free.
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.100]   So that, to me, is a better thing to do.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.900]   Bite the bullet now, or take door two,
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.700]   which is you just leave the assets alone,
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.660]   and you plan to give these to the kids
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.660]   once they reach past the age of majority, past college.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.140]   And maybe the thing to think about there
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.740]   is because you really can't rebalance,
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.500]   if you rebalance within your account,
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.660]   sounds like this listener had a capital gains distribution
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.860]   which was not under their control, so that stinks.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.140]   They're kinda stuck with that.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.620]   But what they can do is, as they add assets
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.240]   to the account over time, use that cash to rebalance.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.460]   So effectively, you're stuck with the assets you have
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.860]   if you don't wanna pay the tax,
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.220]   but you just rebalance within the account
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.140]   with cash going forward.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.300]   - All right, I got it.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.860]   Sounds very complicated to me.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.180]   I'm glad I never used it.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.460]   - Yeah, I think there's a reason why.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.260]   - All right, we've got a bonus Duncan question.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.620]   Did a heap on Slack yesterday.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.980]   I said, "Duncan, save it for the show."
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.940]   - Finally, East Coast bias, let's do it.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.620]   - So basically, I just wanted Bill's take on,
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.280]   and yours, Ben, but especially the taxman's take on HSAs.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.100]   I know we've talked about 'em a little bit before.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.300]   I still find them confusing.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.540]   We still get questions from people
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.700]   who are confused about them.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.300]   Is it a retirement savings vehicle?
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.780]   Is it a health savings vehicle, truly?
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.620]   Why do they exist?
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.580]   I just don't understand.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.840]   - I gotta be honest, Bill.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.360]   I don't use one, and maybe I should,
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.300]   but to me, it sounds like a huge pain in the ass.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.500]   Am I wrong?
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.140]   Like, saving the receipts, and to me,
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.420]   that sounds like a pain in the butt.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.020]   Or am I off base here?
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.860]   - Is it a pain?
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.220]   Yes, but back to the government is the mob.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.260]   You get with an HSA something you don't get
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.660]   with any other account, and that's triple tax exemption.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.340]   So you fund an HSA.
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.980]   You get a tax deduction for doing that.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:34.820]   Comes from your paycheck.
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.660]   You don't pay tax on it.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.500]   Awesome, right?
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.900]   So that can be worth up to 40% of the value
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.080]   for a high-income taxpayer.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.220]   Then, if the asset grows,
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.060]   let's say you invest in the stock market.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.100]   It grows, I don't know, 10% a year, 5% a year,
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.940]   whatever we're doing here these days for math.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.440]   Let's say it doubles over 10 years.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.160]   All that gain can come out tax-free in the future
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.480]   if you're using it to pay medical expenses.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.320]   So that's the key,
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.200]   is that you get a tax deduction up front.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.940]   You do not have to pay tax on the back end,
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.220]   kind of like a Roth,
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.980]   but the triple comes in in the respect
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.060]   that any gains that develop in that account,
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.500]   those are tax-free, too.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.580]   And so, Ben, you mentioned hoarding receipts.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.720]   It's kind of like a neat thing
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.300]   because when you get your dental work done
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.060]   or when you get some medical expense,
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.140]   the year that you take the HSA distribution
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.460]   doesn't have to be the year that you get the work done,
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.300]   which is crazy,
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.860]   and I have no idea why the tax code is written this way,
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.220]   but that allows you to effectively incur expenses today,
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.100]   leave the money in the account, let it grow,
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.380]   and basically use your future gains
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.140]   to pay for medical expenses in the past tax-free.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.180]   It's really wild stuff. - So if Duncan
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.640]   funds an HSA today and then in 10 years,
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.300]   he surgically has a hat placed on his head
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.820]   that can never be taken off.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.660]   - I thought that was it, yeah.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.220]   - He can use that as his HSA
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.380]   and use that as a tax break, basically.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.500]   - It kind of sounds like "Financial Inception."
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.340]   I'm just having trouble remembering.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.940]   - Yeah, in this wild version of hat surgery, then yes.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.980]   So the reason that most people don't know
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.540]   or use these things is you have to have
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.440]   what's called a high-deductible healthcare plan.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.180]   This isn't universally open.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.180]   You have to have what's defined as an HDHP healthcare plan
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.500]   in order to participate.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.740]   But Duncan, you asked, "Are these retirement vehicles?"
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.740]   Well, yes.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.900]   If you happen to not have any medical expenses,
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.940]   which God bless you if you don't,
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.360]   if you make it to age 65, I think it is, yeah, 65,
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.500]   you can take the distributions penalty-free.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.920]   And so effectively, you can use this
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.660]   as kind of like a super IRA,
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.320]   and it's not just your medical expenses.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.180]   It's your spouse's, it's your kid's,
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.900]   potentially anybody that you're providing for.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.260]   It's a very, very powerful thing in the tax code.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.280]   I wish that there were higher balances.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.380]   You can only do like $6,000 or $7,000 a year,
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.060]   and I wish this was open to more Americans
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.220]   'cause it's a really, really powerful thing.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.540]   - So does the reason this exists,
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.200]   is this essentially a way for companies
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.900]   to not spend as much on healthcare plans, though?
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.060]   Is that the idea of the high-deductible plan being?
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.980]   - Yeah, that's part of it.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.740]   I mean, not just companies, but yes,
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.740]   you can generally get a less expensive plan
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.740]   on a higher deductible for obvious reasons.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.940]   I think if you're kind of a health policy person,
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:55.820]   that does make sense.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.720]   You probably don't want somebody going to the doctor
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.660]   for every little silly thing, right?
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.140]   So that's why these high deductibles do make sense.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.940]   But if you're interested in covering catastrophic insurance,
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.900]   they're really perfect.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.500]   If you're relatively healthy,
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.040]   if you don't have a lot of health concerns,
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.160]   if you don't expect to, your genes are good,
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.300]   they're a really powerful thing
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.180]   because it effectively allows you
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.620]   to put away $6,000 a year and deduct it fully,
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.420]   and then use that for some future expense.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.540]   They're very powerful things.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.380]   - Are you sold, Duncan?
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.200]   - Like I said, I wish there were--
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.260]   - I can see the wheels turning there.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.980]   - Yeah, no, I mean, this makes sense.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.820]   It makes sense.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.380]   I mean, I asked the chat,
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.100]   and so it looks like 36% of the chat has an HSA.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.180]   - Wow, that's awesome.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.020]   - That's actually higher than I thought.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.580]   - Yeah, good for you.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.700]   - All right, actually, I saw a few quick questions
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.540]   from the chat.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.780]   Someone asked, "Is the 50/30/20 rule pre-tax?"
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.900]   I would say it's probably net of taxes.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:43.880]   That's what I would think,
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.340]   because you're taking anything you have to spend, basically.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.180]   Someone else asked--
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.140]   - Yeah, you don't need pre-tax returns.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.920]   - Yeah, someone else asked, "Hey, I just got my mortgage.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.480]   "How long do you have to wait until you refinance?"
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.360]   The rule of thumb is typically 1%,
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.040]   but you could also basically calculate the break-even
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.160]   between if you're paying $4,000 in closing costs,
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.000]   or if you live in New York,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.880]   you're paying like $27,000 in closing costs.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.740]   How long is it gonna take you on your monthly payment
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.840]   that you save to break even?
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.000]   I think the rule of thumb is like,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.800]   yeah, if it's less than two or three years,
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.320]   go ahead and do it.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.400]   - I've seen a two-month cycle.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.400]   Taxpayer or listener signed up, client signed up.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.080]   Two months later, there was a big rate drop,
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:21.920]   and they did.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.740]   They just went back to the bank and said,
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.880]   "Hey, can we refinance?"
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.720]   So they did.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.120]   - I'm just saying, 3% mortgage rates
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.200]   by the end of the decade, timestamp that it's happening.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.080]   - Wow, that's a call.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.320]   Yeah, I don't know, I don't know.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.160]   - That's what I think.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.280]   All right, thanks again to Bill.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.320]   We wanna mention real quick,
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   this was great, was some help from Duncan and John.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.120]   John is our producer off-camera.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.980]   They put together these awesome graphics for us
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.840]   that they've been in Animal Spirits before for NFTs,
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.360]   so John, show what they look like here.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.480]   Michael and I are minting NFTs,
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.080]   which I still don't know how it happened.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.540]   Luckily, we had someone who knew what they were doing,
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.760]   did this for us, a company called Audiograph.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.160]   Michael and I are selling these for charity.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.680]   All the money's going to No Kid Hungry,
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.460]   so if you haven't heard about this yet,
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.300]   take a look, check it out.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.120]   It's on my website.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.620]   All the information is there.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.360]   You get access to a Discord channel with us,
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.440]   and you get all these benefits.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.520]   You get to ask us questions.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.960]   We answer with videos and all these things,
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.800]   and we're giving all the money to charity.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.620]   - It's off to a great start.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.460]   - Yeah, it's off to a great start.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.160]   We've already raised like $50,000.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.160]   It's 0.1 ETH to do this.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.840]   All the money's going to a good cause.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.740]   Duncan and John did an awesome job
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.640]   putting the NFTs together.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.280]   They're really hilarious, funny, and really well done,
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.600]   so take a look at that if you haven't.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.980]   Keep those questions and comments coming.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.820]   Again, maybe one of these times
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.880]   we'll do a lightning round.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.160]   Thanks again to Bill for his tax expertise.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.640]   Thank you to Duncan, as always.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.040]   Like his questions as well.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.920]   And if you have a question for us,
