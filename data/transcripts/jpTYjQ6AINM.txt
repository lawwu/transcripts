[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.900]   Now we come this evening in our study of this great epistle to the Romans to the seventh
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.600]   chapter and the sixth verse. The sixth verse in the seventh chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:24.240]   to the Romans. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.600]   that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter. This
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:39.240]   verse, as all who were present last Friday will recall, is the second half of the statement
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.400]   which is made by the apostle in these two verses, verses five and six. I was reminding
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:53.320]   you last Friday that verses five and six are really an explication or an explanation of
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.920]   the statement made in verse four. There he had gloried in the fact that we had become
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.160]   dead to the law by the body of Christ in order that we might be married to this other who
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.560]   is raised from the dead, in order that we might bear forth or bring forth fruit unto
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.840]   God. Now having made that statement, he feels it is necessary to explain it. Why was that
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.000]   necessary? So he deals with that in these two verses. In verse five he gives us the
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.640]   negative, in verse six the positive. In verse five he tells us why it was absolutely essential
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.240]   that our marriage to the law should be broken. He has told us that it has been by the death
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.060]   of Christ. But why had it to happen? Well, it had to happen for this reason. When we
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.600]   were in the flesh, which means under the law, the motions of sins, the passions of sins
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.000]   which were by the law, not originated by the law, but stimulated, aggravated, inflamed
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.840]   by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. The effect of being
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.200]   under the law and married to the law was that far from delivering us from sin, it made us
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.280]   sin all the more. That is the terrible condition of men in sin. We drew out certain conclusions
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.380]   at the end, which I am not going to repeat this evening. Now there is the negative side.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.640]   But you see, in verse four there is a positive side also, and he feels that that needs a
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.260]   further word of explanation. Now that is the thing that we have here this evening in this
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.100]   sixth verse. It is, in a sense, a repetition of the positive half of verse four, which
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.460]   says that we should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:57.060]   we should bring forth fruit unto Christ. In a way, I say, it is a repetition of that.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.300]   But the apostle never merely makes a repetition. He always adds something to it. He always
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.140]   gives a further emphasis to the thing. And we shall find that he does that in this particular
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.460]   verse. Now there are many ways in which we can approach
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:21.780]   this verse. Let me put it like this immediately. Here, once more, we have one of those great
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.780]   statements in which the apostle again seems to delight to state the whole essence of the
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.420]   Christian gospel and the Christian position. He has just done it in verse four, but he
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.460]   does it again. He is so rejoiced in doing it. Here is one of these statements, if you
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:50.820]   like, which gives us a definition of a Christian. What is a Christian? Well, here is an answer.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.660]   There are many things you can say about him, or if you prefer it, you can say the one thing
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.380]   about him in many different ways. And that is what he is doing here. Very well, let us
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.420]   follow him. He starts off, of course, with these two glorious
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:13.980]   words "but now". And if "but now" does not move you, well, I take leave to query
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.940]   whether you are a Christian or not. "But now". There is the whole of Christianity
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.260]   here. He is very fond of this. We have heard it before. You remember in the twenty-second
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.860]   verse of the previous chapter, he does it again. He had been saying, "For when ye
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.500]   were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had he then in those
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.900]   things whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now ye are
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.380]   no longer there." "But now". And of course, we had that glorious example of it in the
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.820]   third chapter, in verse twenty-one. There he has been working through that tremendous
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.620]   argument from verse eighteen in chapter one, and he is wound up in verse twenty of chapter
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.620]   three saying, "Therefore by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.660]   sight. For by the law is the knowledge of sin." That is hopeless. Is it the end?
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:19.100]   Not at all. "But now the righteousness of God without the law, apart from the law, is
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:27.420]   manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets." Well, I say, we might very
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.740]   well spend the rest of the evening on "but now". However, having done so a few times,
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.220]   as the apostle himself has done, we can proceed to a more detailed exposition of what it leads
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.700]   to. But I do want to emphasize this point once more. This is the way that every one
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.300]   of us who is a Christian should think of himself or herself. This is our life, this is our
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:04.700]   position. "We were, but now." You see, verse five, "When we were in the flesh."
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:11.700]   But we are no longer there. "But now." And that is, I say, the test of whether we are
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:20.500]   Christians or not. Can I say, "I was, but now." That's it. It tells us everything.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.260]   We shall be elaborating this, but let me say this at this point. You see, at once we are
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:33.140]   reminded of the completeness of the change. There is nothing gradual about becoming a
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:40.420]   Christian. You are either a Christian or you are not a Christian. You can't be partly
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.660]   Christian. No, no. You are either dead or alive. You are either born or not born. It's
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.300]   exactly like that with Christianity. Nothing gradual about it. Nothing indeterminate about
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:01.220]   it. We either are or we are not. We were, we are, but now. A complete change. Something
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:08.820]   which, as he goes on to remind us, is absolutely and entirely new.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.860]   The only other thing I want to emphasize at this stage is this. This, which he is saying
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:23.980]   here, is true of all Christians. He is not only speaking of some Christians. He is speaking
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:30.980]   of all Christians, without exception. He is not simply speaking of certain Christians
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.780]   who have had some additional or some second blessing, which therefore puts them into this
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:41.660]   position. No, no. He isn't doing that at all. This is what is true of every Christian.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:51.980]   Formerly, we were, as the whole of mankind was, in the flesh. But now, we are delivered.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.860]   Who are we? Well, we were Christians. Everybody was a Christian. Not only certain Christians.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.340]   You can't be a Christian at all without this being true of you. And this is true of
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:10.260]   everyone who is a Christian. Now, that is of tremendous significance. We shall see that
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:20.620]   more and more as we proceed with this exposition of the following passages.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.460]   Chapter 8, you see, is in a sense nothing but an exposition of this sixth verse of chapter
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:31.460]   7. So that is why it is pivotal that we should be clear as to what he is saying here. Chapter
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:37.140]   8 is not true of only certain Christians. It is true of every Christian. You realize
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.140]   why I am emphasizing that. There are people who talk about the Christian, you see, who
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:46.780]   was in chapter 7, passes over to chapter 8. Every Christian is in chapter 8, as every
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:54.340]   Christian is in this sixth verse of chapter 7. Because chapter 8 is nothing but an exposition
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.220]   of this sixth verse of chapter 7. Hence the significance of that emphasis. Very well,
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:05.580]   it is true of all Christians, not only of some. Not certain special Christians only.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:11.220]   Very well, we go on to consider what he says about us. The first thing he tells us is that
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:21.460]   we are delivered. A better translation is, we have been delivered. It is something that
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:31.580]   has happened once and forever. We have been delivered from the law. It is a very strong
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:41.860]   word, this delivered. Some people translate it as discharged, set at liberty, set free.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:47.340]   We are no longer under it. That is his whole point here. We have had a complete discharge
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:54.540]   from it, like a man who is discharged out of the army. If I may use the comparison,
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.100]   he can pass every tyrannizing sergeant major without being at all afraid of him. He has
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:05.140]   got no more authority over him. He is finished with him. He has got his discharge. He can
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.020]   smile in his face and tell him that he has got no authority over him at all. He has had
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:15.540]   his discharge. Well, says the apostle, we have had our discharge. But we have got an
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.740]   illustration here. We need not go and seek them, as I have been doing. We have already
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:26.020]   had the word in the second verse of this chapter. The woman, he says, which hath a husband,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.740]   is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. But if the husband be dead,
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:37.140]   she is loosed from the law of her husband. That is it. Discharged from, set free from.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:44.940]   Same word exactly, and it carries the same meaning and the same emphasis.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:51.940]   In other words, you see, he is working out his own illustration still of the woman married
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.860]   to one husband and now married to another. Separated from the first by means of that
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.460]   death and now joined to the other. But what he is emphasizing here is this, that she is
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:08.260]   absolutely free from the control and the dominion and the power and the authority of that first
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:16.700]   husband. We know, we have already been told in verse 4, that this has happened because
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:22.500]   of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ in his body on the cross. And the fact that because
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:29.100]   we are joined to him, we died with him. That is how we have thus obtained the discharge
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:35.660]   and the deliverance from the old marriage, the old contract.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:45.340]   So well, we go on and say we are delivered, we have been delivered from the law. And it
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:50.660]   is important we should understand this. In what sense has the Christian been delivered
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.260]   from the law? The apostle repeats it, you see. We have got to repeat it, though we have
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:03.940]   said it several times already in expanding. He has been delivered in every sense which
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:09.700]   has already been referred to. The Christian is delivered from the condemnation of the
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.980]   law. The law can no longer condemn him. He will say that again in the first verse of
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:20.380]   chapter 8, "There is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus." All right,
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:27.540]   we are free from the condemnation of the law. We are also delivered in this way. We are
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:34.540]   delivered from the inability of the law to justify us. We were all in some shape or form
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:40.420]   trying to justify ourselves by the law, by works, which means by the law. We are freed
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:46.940]   from that. The law which held us could not justify us. As I have already reminded you
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:53.180]   in quoting the 20th verse of the third chapter, we are free from that. But we are also, and
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.700]   this is the thing that he is most concerned about here, we are delivered from the inability
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:04.180]   of the law to sanctify us. We were under the law. Yes, and while we were under the law
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.500]   we could never be sanctified. The law cannot do it. It can no more sanctify us than it
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.620]   could justify us. But we were held there and we could not be joined to anybody else. We
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.500]   had no freedom. But now we have been delivered, he says. Thank God we have. There is a possibility
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.940]   now then. If I can get out of the clutches, as it were, of that first husband and be joined
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.140]   to another, there is a hope for me. There is no hope while I am there, but I am set
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:36.580]   free. So I am set free from the inability to be sanctified. And he is, I say, particularly
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:43.060]   concerned to emphasize that. And indeed, he is particularly concerned to emphasize something
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:49.860]   in addition to that. The thing that he has been talking about in chapter 5. The trouble,
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:55.460]   he says, with us when we were under the law and in the flesh was this. That the law which
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:03.780]   exercised such power over us and in us, far from delivering us from sin, aggravated them,
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.500]   inflamed them. Now he will tell us all this in much greater detail later on, but he has
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   already said it here. These passions, these motions of sins which were aggravated by the
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.980]   law, did work in our members and it simply brought forth fruit unto death. But there
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:25.980]   we were, we could not get free. We were married, we were bound, and this power was there working
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:32.100]   in us and we could not set ourselves free from this power that was producing fruit unto
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:38.460]   death and dragging us down, as it were. But now, says the apostle, you are set free. And
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:47.580]   he is very concerned about this. We are now free from the aggravating effect of the law
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:53.620]   of God upon our sinful nature. Now that is a very strong statement, isn't it? But it
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:59.580]   is the statement the apostle is making. It is his whole argument at this point. We have
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:10.500]   been set free from this tendency even of the law of God to aggravate our problem. And,
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:17.900]   as he has already put it in verse 20 of the fifth chapter, "Moreover the law entered,"
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.860]   he said, "that the offense might abound." That is the same idea. We have been delivered
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:31.980]   from it. Very well then. There is the first statement. But now we are delivered from the
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:39.540]   law. Then, as a further explanation of it, that being dead wherein we were held. Now
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:45.500]   this is the most unfortunate translation here in the authorized version from which I read.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.860]   There is really nothing to be said for it. It is altogether wrong. It is one of the few
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:54.820]   cases where the authorized translators really have done something which has no justification
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:16:02.180]   at all. Not merely are the manuscripts against them, but furthermore, the whole parallel
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:07.740]   of the chapter and the argument of the chapter indicates that they are wrong. And everybody
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:14.580]   virtually is agreed in saying that they really did go astray here. In other words, the translation
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:23.220]   should be like this. Instead of saying "that" being dead wherein we were held, we should
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:30.940]   translate "we" having died to "that" wherein we were held. It is we who have died.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:38.060]   Now you remember the parallel in verse 4, wherefore he says, "My brethren, you also
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:43.860]   are become dead to the law." You remember the point, don't you? It looked as if his
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:50.660]   illustration in verses 2 or 3 would lead him to say that the law, our first husband had
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.620]   died, but he deliberately doesn't say that. He says, "You also are become dead to the
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:01.740]   law by the body of Christ." And he is really saying the same thing here. We have now been
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:08.420]   delivered from the law having died to that wherein we were held, which is nothing but
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:14.380]   the law. We have died to the law. Of course, in the end, the meaning is left very much
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:20.260]   the same, because if we have died to the law, well, as far as we are concerned, the law
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.140]   is dead, but actually it isn't, and that's why he's careful in his statements. It is
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:31.940]   we who have become dead to the law wherein we were held. And of course, it obviates having
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:38.340]   to say that the law is dead, something which the Scripture never says. But there are people
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.380]   who have said that and have landed themselves in grievous heresies and in the consequent
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:51.940]   trouble in their life and living. So the apostle says that we have died to that wherein we
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:59.780]   were held, and that wherein we were held is the law. But you notice his term? "We were
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:07.580]   held by it." "We were ruled by it." It's the same term exactly which he has used in the
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:15.500]   first verse. "Know ye not, brethren, that the law hath dominion over a man, as long as
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.460]   he liveth." That's the word. "Hath dominion over a man." We were held by it. Whether we
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:26.900]   like it or not, that was the position. Every man, until he becomes a Christian, is in bondage
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:33.900]   under the law. He's held by it, he's dominated, he controls him and governs the whole of his
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:42.340]   activity. But, says the apostle, that's no longer true of us. We've been delivered. We
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:49.780]   are dead to that which formerly had this dominion, this tyrannizing power and effect over us.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:55.860]   Very well. Why now then does he rejoice in all this? Why does it give him such happiness
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:01.340]   to say, "But now, that's no longer true of us. We have been delivered from all that being
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:07.380]   dead to the law which did hold us down." Why is this so important? And the answer is in
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:17.820]   the word "that." The next word, which means, "In order that." In order that. That we should
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:25.100]   serve in newness of spirit, etc. Now, that is the correct translation here. There are
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.140]   some, I think you'll find the Revised Standard Version translates it like this, "So that
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:35.940]   we serve." But that isn't what he means at all. It is true to say that we do serve. Yes,
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:41.620]   but the apostle is concerned with the object and the intent and the purpose. That has happened
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:48.260]   to us, he says, "In order that we might serve." That's the translation. "In order that."
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:57.060]   Now then, here of course we come to the very nerve and center of the apostle's entire argument.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:08.380]   This is the thing he's really concerned about. The great, grand object of salvation is our
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:17.260]   sanctification, is holiness. That's the whole purpose of salvation. The whole object of
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.180]   the coming of the Son of God into this world and all he did while he was here, his death
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.500]   upon the cross, his burial, his resurrection, his ascension, the sending of the Holy Spirit,
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:35.900]   all of it has one grand end and object, that we might be holy before him in love. That
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:44.300]   is the whole purpose of salvation. And we must never say anything but that. It isn't
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:48.300]   forgiveness only. You must never stop at that. It isn't justification only. You must never
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:55.180]   stop at that. You can't. God has done everything to bring us there.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:02.580]   Now then, there is nothing so wrong, therefore, as what was being said by these critics of
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:08.620]   the apostle Paul. You remember what they said. "Oh," they said, "this is wonderful
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:14.180]   preaching this. He just says, of course, that all you do is to believe on the Lord Jesus
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:20.260]   Christ." They said, "This is terrible. This really means, shall we continue in sin that
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.860]   grace may abound? This means, what then, shall we sin because we're not under the Lord but
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:30.900]   under grace?" They said, "This is terrible. This is going to lead to chaos. This is going
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:36.300]   to lead to a complete breakdown of morality and of law. This is immoral. This teaching
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:41.860]   is wrong. Where's the Lord? Where's righteous living coming in?"
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:46.500]   Now, that's what the apostle is answering in this passage we are dealing with, as he
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:55.020]   was doing in chapter 6. There is nothing, therefore, which is so terribly wrong as to
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:02.780]   say that that is the effect of preaching the doctrines of grace. Because the whole point
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:09.220]   of the doctrine is to show us that God's end and object in doing all that he has done for
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:17.380]   us through his dear Son and by the Holy Spirit is to sanctify us and to make us holy and
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:27.340]   unblameable in his most holy sight. At the same time, it is also true to say this, therefore.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:37.980]   There is nothing which is so wrong and which so denies this truth as antinomianism. What's
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:43.260]   that? Well, that is the position of people who are so concerned about doctrine they never
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.820]   worry about their practice. As long as they've got their heads straight in the doctrine,
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.500]   they don't care how they live. The people who take it only theoretically and never put
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:57.940]   it into practice, that's antinomianism. "Ah," they say, "this is very wonderful, this."
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.380]   But they don't put it into practice. They do nothing about it. They go on living in
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:09.220]   sin. They don't discipline themselves. That's antinomianism. And antinomianism is always
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:17.820]   the greatest enemy of the doctrine of grace. It's a blank and a complete denial of it,
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.860]   because the whole object of the doctrine, the whole object of the salvation, is to deliver
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:30.060]   us from sin, as the apostle indeed goes on to show. Indeed, you see, I can put his argument
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:39.780]   like this. He says nothing could enable us to bring forth fruit unto God except our being
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:47.660]   delivered from the law and its dominion, and being joined to Christ. You see, these advocates
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:53.060]   of the law are really answering themselves and contradicting themselves. These people
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:58.020]   are objected to the apostles' preaching of justification by faith only, and so on. "Ah,"
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.780]   they say, "but what's going to happen to morality? What's going to happen to conduct
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.260]   and to behavior?" And there are still people who say things like that, as you know very
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:10.820]   well. The advocates of morality are always bringing their charge against the evangelical
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:15.780]   preaching of the gospel. But you see, they defeat their own end, as the apostle has proved
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:23.340]   to them. He says, "If you are really concerned about morality and good behavior, well then,"
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:28.340]   he says, "you'd better believe the gospel. Because as long as a man is under the law,
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.940]   not only can the law not deliver him, it will even aggravate the position for him. While
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.500]   he is under the power and the dominion of the law, he's going to sin more and more,
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.260]   that the offense might abound. It will inflame his passions, and they'll work in his members,
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.900]   and he'll get worse and worse. The very law that tells him not to do a thing makes him
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:52.420]   do it. So if you are interested in morality and conduct and behavior," says Paul, "well,
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.900]   the sooner the better you are delivered from the clutches of the law." And he says, "That
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:01.100]   is the glory of this Christian way of salvation." But now, this righteousness from God has come
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.700]   in, this other way of salvation has come in, and now this really can deliver us. We are
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:10.380]   no longer under something that aggravates the position. We are now in a condition and
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:16.460]   in a status and a position where we are delivered from all that and joined to another power.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:25.580]   Very well. It's important we should be clear about that. In order that. In order that what?
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:34.500]   Well, in order that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:40.540]   Notice his word, "serve." We've met it before. Do you remember when we were doing
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:51.300]   chapter 6, we kept on reminding one another that the term "servant" always means "slave"?
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.700]   You remember we found it first there in chapter, in verse 16, "Know ye not that to whom ye
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:02.300]   yield yourselves servants, slaves to obey, his slaves ye are to whom ye obey, whether
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.220]   of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness. But God be thanked that ye were the slaves
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.780]   of sin, that ye have obeyed from the heart the form of sound doctrine, etc. Then verse
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:17.340]   20, "But when ye were the slaves of sin, ye were free from righteousness." But now
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:24.380]   he says in verse 22, "being made free from sin and become slaves to God." And he takes
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:33.180]   up that expression again. All this has happened to us that we might now "slave" in newness
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:40.900]   of spirit. That's what "serve" means, to "slave." This wife is the slave of her
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:47.380]   husband and she's a very happy slave, whose service is perfect freedom. Paul rejoiced
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:52.860]   in calling himself the "bond slave of Jesus Christ." That's what he means when you
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.200]   read in the Authorized Translation, "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ." The correct
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:03.980]   translation is, "Paul, a bond slave of Jesus Christ." There's nothing more wonderful
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:11.260]   than to be the slave of such a husband, the bond slave of Jesus Christ. Well, he says
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:17.220]   this is the object of our being set free from the law and its dominion. It is in order that
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:22.460]   we might "slave" in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter. That's
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:28.500]   just another way of saying what he has said in verse 4, that he should be married to another,
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:35.220]   even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. Yes,
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:41.200]   but it is another way of saying it. And this is where the extra meaning comes in. This
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:48.220]   is where we come face to face with his addition. He's taking the matter a step and a stage
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:55.220]   further than he had done before. In other words, we come to this vital point now in
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:03.980]   which he is going to emphasize the character of our service, the different character of
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:13.220]   the life, the service, the slavery which we now live. He contrasts it with the old way
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:24.320]   of living. And let us be clear about this. He is contrasting here now the Christian,
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:35.380]   the man in Christ, as regards living the moral, the good life. He's contrasting him with
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:42.980]   the best possible type of moral man who is under the law and in the flesh. That's what
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:51.140]   he's doing. And we must bear that in our minds. There are men, there were men then,
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:57.660]   there are still men, who read the moral law. They say, "That's right, that's good.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:03.940]   I'm going to live that. I'm going to try to practice that." And they do their utmost.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:10.180]   They do it in the energy of their own flesh. Now then, what he's contrasting is that sort
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:18.980]   of man and this man who has become a Christian. And he, of course, is concerned to bring out
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:25.420]   the differences and the striking contrast. And I have ventured to classify them and to
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:34.260]   subdivide them in this way. He first of all shows us the general differences between the
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:43.660]   two men, and then he shows us the particular differences. They're all here in a nutshell,
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:51.260]   and we must draw them out. There are certain big differences between these two men, and
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:55.940]   there are certain particular differences which come out of and follow inevitably from the
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:04.100]   big ones. Now then, what are these big general differences? Here's the first. It is the
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:14.780]   difference between the old and the new. He says, "In newness of spirit, and not in the
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:26.140]   oldness of the letter." Here are great New Testament words again, "the old and the new."
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:33.580]   What's more, you see, he can't refrain from emphasizing the tremendous contrast, the
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:42.340]   complete and entire difference between the Christian life and the non-Christian life.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:48.580]   This of course isn't peculiar to this apostle. It's the teaching of the New Testament everywhere.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:55.580]   The greatest illustration of this is in our Lord's words of course to Nicodemus. Poor
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:01.340]   Nicodemus. He thought that Christianity was something that you added on to what you'd
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:09.300]   already got. That was the whole basis of his seeking the interview. "Rabbi, thou art a
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.300]   teacher come from God, for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:20.620]   him." But he wasn't allowed to go further, but he was going on to say, "Now then, I'm
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:26.100]   a master of Israel, and I know much more than the people, but you know more than I do, and
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:31.420]   you've got more. What must I do to get to where you are? How can I get this extra?"
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.340]   Suddenly our Lord cut across him. He read his mind. We've already been told at the
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.060]   end of chapter two of John's Gospel that he had no need for anybody to tell him what
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:44.180]   was in men. He knew what was in men, and he read Nicodemus as an open book. He said, "Look
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:50.260]   here, verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:58.540]   of God." You won't even get a fleeting glimpse of it. You've got to be born again.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:08.020]   This is no question of addition. This is regeneration. This is new birth. This is literally starting
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:22.180]   de novo, afresh. Being born again, old, new, the old deadness, the new life. Or take our
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:30.180]   Lord's other way of putting it. People couldn't understand him. They came to him and said,
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:38.220]   "We don't quite follow you. The disciples of John the Baptist fast often. Your disciples
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:43.180]   don't seem to be fasting at all. You claim to be greater than John. You set yourself
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:49.860]   up as a teacher. John's disciples baptized. Yours don't." You remember his answer,
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:55.820]   don't you? He said, "Look here, you put new wine into new bottles. This is absolutely
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:02.780]   new. This isn't just a superior brand or a better brand than the kind of thing that
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:08.940]   you used to have. Absolutely new. New wine. You must have brand new bottles to suit it.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.940]   Or it's like a piece of cloth. You don't take a new piece of cloth and put it into
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:19.820]   the old, it'll tear it, it'll make it worse. No, no. It's entirely new. New wine, new
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:28.180]   bottles. Not gradually passing from that to this. No, no. Old, new. Complete separation.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:35.220]   Absolute division. Or take this same apostle putting the same point again magnificently
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:41.700]   in the second epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 5 and in verse 16. He says, "Look
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:50.500]   here, henceforth, now we know men after the flesh. We used to know men after the flesh.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:56.620]   No longer. As a preacher of the gospel, as an emissary and an ambassador for Christ,
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.700]   as one who preaches because the love of Christ constraineth him, this is my position. I know
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:08.220]   no man any longer after the flesh. That was the old way. Yeah, even though we have known
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:15.660]   Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him so no more." In other words,
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:22.940]   he says in verse 17, "If any man be in Christ," that's to say if he's a Christian,
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:33.660]   "he's a new creature, a new creation. All things are passed away, they've gone.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:42.820]   All things are become new." Now, you can't get anything beyond that, can you? But that's
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:49.180]   what he's saying here, you see. And again, I say, if you don't thrill to this, how
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:57.740]   can you be a Christian? No longer the old, the new. Not the oldness of the letter, but
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:04.740]   the newness in the Spirit. Old and new. What a contrast.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:10.340]   But come along, let's go to the second bit of contrast, which is the contrast, you notice,
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:21.140]   between the letter and the Spirit, that we should slave in the newness of the Spirit
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:30.060]   and not in the oldness of the letter. Now, what does he mean by the letter? Here again
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:38.740]   is an interesting point. Actually, what the apostle wrote was not letter, but writing.
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:46.500]   Not, he says, in the oldness of the writing. And it's an important difference that when
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:54.900]   he says writing, he is referring, of course, to the written moral law that was given through
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:36:03.580]   Moses. They refer to it as the writing, because God wrote it on the tables of stone and gave
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:14.500]   them to Moses, you remember. The written law. Of course, that was just the explicit statement
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:20.020]   of the law which God had originally given to men, and which Paul has reminded us in
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:25.580]   chapter 2, you remember, is written in the hearts of all men, even the Gentiles, who
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.620]   had never heard the law of Moses. But the point is that in the law of Moses it was made
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:40.660]   explicit. It was reduced to writing. God wrote it. There it is, perfectly plain and clear.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:50.500]   Now then, says the apostle, the way we serve now is not after or according to the old way,
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   which was an attempt at conformity to that which was written. That means under the law,
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:05.580]   the law as your master, your husband, or your controlling power. We are no longer like that,
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:13.220]   says that was the old. What's the new? Oh, here it is, in the Spirit. The new is a life
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:18.020]   lived in the Spirit. Not under law, in and under the Spirit.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:23.660]   Now, let's be clear about the translation here. He doesn't simply mean that we are
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:28.660]   now trying to keep the law in a new spirit. That isn't what he is saying at all. That's
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:37.140]   the wrong translation. What he is saying is this. That doesn't bring out the consciousness
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:45.100]   it should. He means that we are now living in the sphere and the realm of the Holy Spirit
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:53.740]   of God. That's the contrast. Not living under law or in law, living in the Spirit,
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:59.540]   under the Spirit, the power of the Holy Spirit. This S here should be a capital S. That we
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:10.420]   should serve in newness of Spirit, Holy Spirit, Spirit of God, and not in the oldness of the
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:14.340]   writing. Well, now you notice that here he mentions
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:19.420]   the Holy Spirit. The last time he mentioned the Holy Spirit was in verse 5 of chapter
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:29.180]   5. And again, I would remind you that the whole of chapter 8 is just an exposition of
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:35.220]   this sixth verse of this seventh chapter. Chapter 8 is concerned to show us this life
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:40.700]   of the Spirit. He starts off in verse 2. "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,"
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:46.740]   that's it, "hath made me free from the law of sin and death." He is just taking
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:51.260]   up there what he is saying in this sixth verse of chapter 7, so that he can work it out and
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:59.900]   elaborate it. And that is the meaning of chapter 8. Verses 7 to 25 of chapter 7 are a digression
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:04.180]   in which he is again dealing with objections and difficulties. But having done that, he
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.420]   takes up again in chapter 8 the very thing that he is saying in the verse that we are
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:15.580]   looking at together this evening. In other words, the Christian life is an entirely
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:28.020]   new life which is made possible because the Holy Spirit of God dwells in us as the result
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:37.460]   of our union to and marriage with the Lord Jesus Christ. That's it. That's the Christian
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:45.580]   life. The whole of the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. And it is therefore entirely
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:53.540]   different from that old life which was lived in the flesh and under the law.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.660]   Now there are endless statements of this. I am just going to give you a few quotations
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:03.340]   before we leave it for this evening and leave our particular working out of the contrast
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:07.820]   until next week. But let me just give you one or two. Take for instance what the apostle
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:15.780]   says in 2 Corinthians 3 and in verses 5 and 6. He is talking about himself, not that we
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:21.260]   are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:29.900]   God, who also, he says, hath made us able ministers of what? Of the new covenant? We
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:35.180]   are ministers of a new covenant. But then you see it is not enough just to say it positively.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.900]   He has to say it negatively. Able ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter, not
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:47.220]   of the writing again, but of the Spirit. For the writing giveth, but the Spirit giveth
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:51.380]   life. But here he is, you see, he says, I am a minister of the New Testament, of the
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:56.140]   new covenant. What's that? Well, he says, it's not of the writing, it's of the Spirit,
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:00.860]   capital S, the Spirit of the living God that is referred to in the third verse of that
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:08.300]   chapter. Indeed, my friends, the whole of the Christian life is life in the Spirit.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:16.220]   I have already quoted to you the second verse of the next chapter. The law of the Spirit
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:23.580]   of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. That's every
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:32.660]   Christian. And everything he does is done in the Spirit. Listen to verses five and six
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:39.060]   of this eighth chapter. He says, they that are after the flesh do mind, think of, and
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:43.580]   understand, and are interested in the things of the flesh. But they that are after the
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:49.100]   Spirit, capital S, mind the things of the Spirit. You know, if you are a Christian,
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:54.300]   you've got a new mind. You're interested in new things, not in the old, but in the
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.780]   new. And they're spiritual things, and you think in a different way. You see, the difference
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.620]   between the Christian and the non-Christian is really an absolute difference. They don't
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:07.540]   even think in the same way. There's a complete change of thinking. For, he says, to be carnally
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:16.100]   minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. So we think in a new way.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:23.780]   Oh yes, and you know, we worship God in a new way. Do you remember how Our Lord put
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.180]   it to the woman of Samaria? Read chapter four of John's Gospel. She is concerned about
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:32.220]   the question, should we worship in this mountain, or should we worship in Jerusalem? That was
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:37.820]   the big thing. Where do you worship? How do you worship? Vestments. Do you stand or kneel
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.100]   as you pray? Here or there? That's the question. You see, that was her idea of worship and
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:49.460]   of praying. Do you remember what Our Lord said to her? God is spirit, and they that
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:58.740]   worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Whether on this mountain or in Jerusalem,
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:04.180]   standing or sitting, it doesn't matter. God is spirit, and they that worship him must
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:10.020]   worship him in spirit and in truth. Listen to Paul saying it again in Philippians 3.3.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:16.060]   What are these people talking about? He says, "These Judaizers." We are the circumcision.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:26.060]   Well what are we? Which worship God in the spirit. No, no, we don't have altars. We
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:31.860]   don't have signs, crucifixes, and all these things. We worship God in the spirit. We don't
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:36.380]   have to have a particular building. No, no, we can use buildings. We can do equally well
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:41.940]   without them. We worship God in the spirit, not as we used to, he says, in the temple
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:46.580]   and the burnt offerings and sacrifices. All that's finished. We worship God in the spirit
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:56.060]   and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh. So that our worship is entirely
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:04.740]   different. Our prayer is different. Jude 20 says, "Praying in the spirit." 1 Corinthians
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:11.180]   14, 15. What is it then? "I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:17.740]   also." There is this spiritual, purely spiritual prayer which can't always find words for
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:21.900]   itself. The spirit makes it into session for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:28.740]   I will pray in the spirit. I will pray with the understanding also. Everything we do
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:35.980]   now is in the spirit. Oh yes, he says in the fourth verse of chapter 8 that the righteousness
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:43.980]   of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk. How do we walk? Not after the flesh, but after
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:53.620]   the spirit, capital S. So he gives an exhortation to the Galatians in Galatians 5, 16. "Walk
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:45:08.140]   in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the desires of the flesh." Isn't it clear?
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:15.940]   The Christian life is a complete contrast to the old and regenerate life at its very
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:27.380]   best. It is the difference between the new, the old, between life in the spirit of God
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:43.060]   and life under and dominated by the law. Thank God that we can say, "But now we are no longer
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:52.580]   what we were. We have been delivered from the law, having died to that which tyrannized
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:46:02.140]   over us and held us down, so that we are free to slave in this new way after the spirit
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:12.580]   of God, and in the realm of the spirit, and in the mind of the spirit, and no longer in
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:23.900]   the oldness of the letter, the writing." I hope that everybody in this congregation
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:33.300]   is rejoicing in the "but now," and that you feel as you look at yourself that you are
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:44.140]   a new creature. Everything has changed. Old things have passed away. Behold, all things
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:52.940]   have become new. You find the sunshine new. You find the flowers and the birds and nature
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:47:01.060]   new. Do you see something of the glory of God in them now that you used not to see?
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:11.020]   Everything lives in every hue Christless eyes have never seen. Thank God for this. The control
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:21.020]   of the spirit, of a mind, affections, will, the whole man, the Christian life, is a life
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:35.060]   in the Holy Spirit. Amen. O Lord, our God, we come unto thee again to offer our humble
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:45.340]   tribute of praise, of thanksgiving, and of adoration. O Lord, thou hast done this great
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:53.700]   thing in us and to us. We pray that we may be given to realize it, to see it, to know
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:48:02.660]   it, and to understand it more and more, until we shall be filled with a sense of amazement
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:17.420]   at ourselves, because we are what we are, by thy grace. O God, receive our humble praise.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:23.460]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the fellowship and
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:32.140]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:40.260]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:50.100]   shall be safe and entire and perfect in glory. Amen.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:54.180]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
