[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Are you going through just a sense of uncertainty,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   maybe a malaise in your life,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   feeling like something's not quite right?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Well, if you're in that situation,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   nothing wrong with that.

[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   here's a question I want you to consider.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Is it possible that you don't know what to do
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   simply because you don't yet know exactly what you want?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   This is the show where we work together
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   to build a rich life now
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and enjoy that life today
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   while also building and executing
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   on a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   The reason that I emphasize that word together
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   is because we really are on a road together.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Yes, I'm the host of this show.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Yes, I consider myself a teacher
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and I'm here to share with you thoughts and ideas
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   and insights and things that I have learned.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   But guess what? We're on exactly the same path.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   That's why I do this show.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I'm working each and every day to live a rich life now
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   and I'm also working each and every day
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   to build a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I'm several years into that plan and things are on track,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   but I haven't yet fully arrived
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   at my own definition of financial freedom,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   but I'm on the way.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And the reason I say together also is because
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   today I'm going to share a little bit of my experience.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Now, I am doing this simply as an example.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   This is not a therapy session for me today.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I'm not going to just be talking on and on about me,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   but I do want to just share a little bit from my own experience
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   because what I've learned is many of you are in similar situations
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   and sometimes it's helpful when somebody can share,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   "Here's what I'm going through and here's what I'm facing,"
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and then you can see the correlations in your own life.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I really believe this concept is one that it seems very simple.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Frankly, when I'm sitting here looking at my notes,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I'm just thinking, "This is pretty obvious,"
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   but I've learned not to second-guess the things that seem obvious
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   because it was meaningful to me.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   In short, I want to talk about decision-making.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I want to talk about whether we really need to spend most of our time
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   working through the decision-making process
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   or whether that time is better spent
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   on simply getting clear about the outcome that we want.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I'm realizing more and more that I have spent and spend too much time
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   in the former, focusing on the process and trying to weigh decisions,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   and not enough time just simply getting very clear on the latter, the vision.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Here's where this came from.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   On Friday, I did a Q&A show, and as a component of that Q&A show,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   the last two Q&A shows, I've been asked about
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   what is the appropriate amount of money to put into retirement plans
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   versus non-retirement plans.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Now, this is a difficult question for me to answer,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   not just because, well, the only answer is a specific personal answer.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Of course, you know that.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Yes, the only real answer is a personal, calculated answer.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Run a financial plan and dig into the goals.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You know that.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   But it's a difficult answer for me to give
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   because it cuts very much across the orthodoxy of common opinion.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   As a trained, formal financial planner,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I have to be careful to give the ideal answer to questions.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I have to be careful to talk about the tax advantages
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   of things like 401(k) plans and IRAs and Roth IRAs.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   That's important.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   If I were still practicing with individual clients,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   there could very realistically be a breach of professional responsibility
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   if I were to give advice that's not the optimal financial advice.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And while I'm sensitive to those who are opposed to the use of tax-deferred accounts,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   for example, I'm sensitive and understand the ideas and fears that the rules will change.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I believe the rules will change myself.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I'm sensitive to the ideas and the fears of the invasion of privacy.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   One of the possible motivations behind the establishment of tax-qualified accounts
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   is that that money becomes very, very public.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It's formally reported to the United States government every year,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   and most of you who are in other countries have similar systems.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I'm sensitive to those concerns, but I'm not – personally, I'm not overly worried about it for various reasons.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I haven't decided I'm just going to go cash out all my IRAs
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and be done with it because of the invasion of privacy.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Some people get there and I get it.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I'm not there myself.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Who knows?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Maybe in a few years I will, but I don't particularly intend to go there.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And so the question often puts me in a difficult position.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And if you listened to the Friday Q&A show, you would have heard me even just talking about it again,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   trying to figure out what's the right solution.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And I know for me the decision I've made is that putting tax-qualified accounts,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   such as my Roth IRAs and my traditional IRAs and that type of investment program at the forefront –
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   putting it at the forefront of my investment plan is no longer the correct course of action for me.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   But I know I have had a lot of listeners who have written me emails and reviews and said,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   "Because of you, I'm fully funding my 401(k) plans."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And I feel a little guilty because I look and say, "Well, if it's not right for me,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   then this listener is taking action based upon what I've said.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Am I really giving the best advice?
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Should I be telling them not to do it?"
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I don't believe the answer is that hardline answer.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   So I was struggling with how do I reconcile this unsettled feeling?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Because I want to give good advice and I don't know how to do it.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   So over the weekend, I was reading, finishing up a book.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I had a slow leak in my tire.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I had a screw in the tire and took it to the tire place to get it patched real quick next to my house.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And I was finishing up on Saturday afternoon, sitting there reading a book called Unworking.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And this is a book by a guy named Clark Van Deventer.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I interviewed him for the show and he sent me a copy of his book and I read it.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And I really have been enjoying it.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   It's a good book.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   It's not a great book, but it really resonated.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Great book in the sense that it's got some – it's not smoothly put together,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   but it just is a book that resonated with me personally.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And so it was a great book for me.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And the subtitle of the book is called Unworking, Exit the Rat Race, Live Like a Millionaire, and Be Happy Now.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Well, in that book, Saturday afternoon, I'm sitting there reading it, and he wrote a note.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   He was talking about the lifestyle that he and his family have chosen.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And the chapter was entitled Family is Greater than Career.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   That was what is important to him.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And he wrote this paragraph in there in describing their lifestyle.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And he was describing – talking about the lifestyle of the kids and how many toys he gives them.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And that was the context for this.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   But he – after describing this lifestyle – and I'll go ahead and read the preceding paragraphs because I think it will help set up the quote that really stood out to me.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   He said, "Our kids probably have fewer toys than most American kids their age.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I think that fewer toys helps develop their creativity.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And because we did not spend our money on toys, they got to go to the rainforest.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   For his birthday when he turned five, our son rode a horse to the top of a volcano and roasted marshmallows on cooling lava.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   How many kids get to do that?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   We ski with our kids all winter long.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   We're at the beach with them all summer.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   We go on hikes and bike rides and spend months on the road together, camping and crashing in hotels and doing cannonballs in the pool.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   There's trips to the aquarium and the zoo and the museum, not occasionally but all the time.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   There's trips to Central America and Thailand and lots of other amazing places.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   How many kids get to celebrate their fifth birthday roasting marshmallows over cooling lava?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Our kids have ridden elephants, fed pink dolphins and snorkeled the Andaman Sea.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   They've learned to count to ten in Thai from a barkeep in Koh Samui.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Their worldview and mine have been stretched by these amazing experiences."
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Here's the quote.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   "This is possible for our family because of the way my wife and I have designed our life.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   We didn't get lucky.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   We did not win the lottery.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   We don't have a rich uncle.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   We just know what we want."
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   When I read that quote sitting there at the car dealership on Saturday afternoon, I circled it.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   If you want to see the actual picture, I circled it and I wrote next to it in my notes,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I put the magic key to a rich life, knowing what you want.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I put a picture of it on Instagram.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I'll link that in the notes for today or just go to Instagram.com/JoshuaSheets and you'll find it.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   But it stood out to me that if you know what you want, the path is simple.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I realized that is what the answer to the 401(k) versus non-401(k) question is.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Now in that Friday Q&A call, a listener said, "Should I put more money into the 401(k)?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I have a million bucks in there."
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I thought, "Well, what do you want?"
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   My answer was, "What do you want?"
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   But I hadn't really identified that what do you want?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   That's the way that you answer that question of how much money should I put in a Roth IRA.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Over those last two shows, there's been some discussion in the private Facebook irregulars group.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Several members of the group said, "Since that show, I went and I reduced my 401(k) contributions
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   because I realized that putting a ton of money into the 401(k) was not right for me."
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Again, when I saw those posts, I said, "Great," but I also felt a little guilty like, "Am I doing the right thing?"
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   But the key of what is the right solution, how much money to put is simply based upon what do you want.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Do you want to have the money set aside for the long-term traditional age 65 retirement
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   while allowing you just simply to live a lifestyle and not worry too much about the investments
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   because they're invested in fairly mainstream things?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Or do you want a lifestyle that gives you something different?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   It's a big question.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I realized that for me, the paragraphs I just read about the children celebrating my son's fifth birthday
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   by riding a horse to the top of a volcano and roasting marshmallows on cooling lava, that's the life I want.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   That's why prioritizing putting money into a 401(k) is no longer right for me.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It may have been right for me at some point in the past, but it's no longer right for me.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   It may be right for you or it may not be right for you, but it's based upon what you want.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   That message has been resonating and resonating with me just consistently for the last few days.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   I thought I got it before, but now I really get it.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I really get it because I've been applying that to all the different areas of my life.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   I've been in a bit of a funk the last few weeks trying to figure out what to do.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I've reached an inflection point in radical personal finance.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Just today, a few minutes before I am recording this show, I just posted a picture of the stats for the show,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   and we just hit two million downloads for radical personal finance, which is an amazing milestone in the history of the show.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Just for the sake of context, that puts radical personal finance in about the top 4% to 5% of all podcasts of any genre in terms of listener size.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   That's a really cool milestone for the show, and I thank each one of you who's listening to me right now.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   But I've struggled the last few weeks even recognizing that, yes, the audience is growing and things are working,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   but I haven't known how to deal with it. I haven't known how to make the decisions.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   The show's not so small that I can just do it all myself, but then I think, "Should I do this? Should I do that?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Should I get bigger in this way? Should I move in this other direction?"
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   I've gone around and around and around and around and around and around, and it's been difficult.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   But the problem isn't because I don't know which decision to make.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   The problem is I'm not clear enough on exactly what I want because depending on what I want, that's what's going to drive the decision.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And so I've been putting the cart before the horse.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   I've been putting the thinking and the pursuing different paths ahead of figuring out and getting clear on what are you trying to do.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   My own problems in being able to execute on my business plan or being able to execute on my task list are not based upon any problem with me
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   in the terms of, "Well, I'm just not good at this," or, "I don't know what to do."
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   The problems of execution are being caused by my lack of a clear vision.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Could that be the same with you in a decision that you're facing right now?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Are your problems of execution being caused simply by the lack of a clear vision?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I'm so grateful for my wife. She's the one who's been helping me diagnose this and this kind of spinning circle I've been in for a few months.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   I was seriously pursuing expanding Radical Personal Finance into an AM radio show.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Then I'm thinking, "Well, I need to do a YouTube show."
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Then I'm thinking, "Well, no, I need to focus on my writing."
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And meanwhile, nothing – I feel like nothing has been getting pressed forward.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   And she constantly asks me, "What are you actually doing and why are you trying to do it?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Why are you going to this and why are you going to that?"
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And I haven't known the answer. It's because I haven't had the clear vision.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   The vision that we have of the outcome that we want will drive the correct decision.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And since that epiphany on Saturday afternoon, I've been just seeing how clearly this applies to most of the problems I'm currently facing in my life
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   and most of the problems that other people are facing in their lives.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   If you know that what you want is to go and travel the world, then the decisions you'll make are simple.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   If you know that you want to travel the world and you want to go now and you want to go on a backpacking trip,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   well, then you just simply prioritize that and you make it happen.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   If you know that you want to travel the world like – what was the guy?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Jim Rogers did years ago in a custom-built – he took a Mercedes convertible and put it onto a Mercedes 4x4 G-Wagon chassis,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   made a custom trailer, and drove that thing around the world.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   If you want to travel the world like that, staying with kings and princes and sultans and driving the world in a custom luxury automobile,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   well, then your path is going to be different.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   The backpacking trip just requires 15,000, 20,000 bucks, sell some stuff, sell some car, grab a backpack and go.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   The other trip requires you to build a massive business.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   So if you want to be a billionaire, you got to put in place a certain financial plan.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   If you want to be a lifestyle entrepreneur, you've got to put in place a certain financial plan.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   It's all based upon the vision.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Now, when that vision gets cloudy, as it has been for me, that's where I thought when I started this show that I wanted to be a lifestyle entrepreneur.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Then I thought, "Well, maybe that's not what I should be doing.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Maybe I should be expanding and becoming more mainstream."
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Then I thought about becoming mainstream and I said, "I'm not a mainstream guy.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   It doesn't work for me, so maybe I should be adjusting in this direction.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   I don't want to go on and on about all the different business decisions I faced."
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   But as I've been struggling with these things, the problem has been I'm not clear enough on what I want.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   That's really all I got for you as far as a show today.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   If you are facing a decision in your life or if you're facing a sense of questions, if you're asking yourself a financial question,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   the answer to it is most likely going to be found in getting clearer on what you want.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   When you're asking advice, whether that's from me or some other professional, the good advisor, yes, they have a little bit of information.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   I have some technical information that is more in-depth in personal finance and financial planning than other people do.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   You'll be working with technical advisors your whole life.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   If you hire an attorney, you're hiring them because of their technical knowledge and their ability to create an outcome for you.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   If you're hiring a consultant or advisor, you're hiring a nutritionist or a personal trainer.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   If you're hiring a personal trainer, you're hiring them to some degree based upon what they know.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   But the skillful advisor that's really going to help you, the primary service and work that they're doing is to be helping you get clear on what you want.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   If it's personal training, if you want to win a fitness model contest, the training for that is going to be very different than winning a bodybuilding contest.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   That's going to be different than winning a Spartan Games or winning a marathon.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   All of those are going to require a different training solution.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And so you've got to first know what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   I'm sharing those physical examples because they're helpful to me.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I've been struggling with the same thing, like what am I trying to do with how healthy I am?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   What's the outcome?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   I'm not really sure, which just means just wandering around in circles.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Sometimes I think it's one thing and then it adjusts in a different direction.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   So the truly skilled professional is going to spend more time working with you, helping you to adjust your vision.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Because once you get clear on the vision of what you're trying to create, the solutions are really pretty simple.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Applies in every part of life.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Applies in everything.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Some of the ways I've been doing it, journaling is useful.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Speaking to yourself.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   I get the benefit of creating a podcast.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   But you can do the same thing for yourself.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Pull out your phone.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Dictate for yourself a voice memo.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   And as we go today, my challenge to you is to do exactly that.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Just think about what you want.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   One other useful thing, I had it in my outline here but I skipped it and I'll just do it as the music winds down.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   The major benefit, if you don't know what you want, don't take any action.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   So the major benefit of a show like mine is to talk about what's available.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   What are the options that are available?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   So this book on working, I'll review it soon, I intend to review it soon.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   But this book on working is useful because it talks to me about what's available.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   It talks to me about the options that other people have chosen.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   I can also read Rob Report and see the options that those people have chosen.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   I can compare those and see what do I want.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   So if we don't know what we want, we need to gather possibilities of what's available.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And then that data will help us to decide.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Thank you all so much for listening to today's show.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   I know it's short.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Hopefully, it's focused and useful to you.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Just sharing a little bit of my personal experience and personal epiphany.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   But I hope that it will be useful to you.

[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Live a rich life now.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And get clear on what financial freedom means to you so that we can build your plan.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   [music]
