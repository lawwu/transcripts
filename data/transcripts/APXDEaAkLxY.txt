[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   All right, let's stand together. [Music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   It's a privilege to be here.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   A few men at this conference.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   My job is to just accompany you for a number of the sessions
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   as we sing the praises of our great King.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   In my church, sometimes we get a little rowdy,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   and since I'm leading, it's okay.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   While I'm leading, because Jesus is worthy.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Psalm 67 begins.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   May God be gracious to us and bless us
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and make his face to shine upon us.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   That your way may be known on earth,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   your saving power among all nations.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Let the peoples praise you, O God.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Let all the peoples praise you.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I love Abner's message.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   So many things about it.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   But at the beginning, this psalm sounds like we're just saying,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Lord, just bless us, make us happy.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Just make us do good things for us.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   But that's not what the psalmist is saying.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Make your face to shine upon us,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   that your way may be known on earth.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Your saving power among all nations.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Let all the peoples praise you, O God.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Let all the peoples praise you.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And we know that's not a prayer that God will not hear,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   because, as Abner reminded us, the results are decided.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   We know the battle will be won,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   and the gospel will go to the ends of the earth.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And what a joy to be a part of that.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   [MUSIC - "JESUS SHALL REIGN FOREVER"]
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Jesus shall reign forever, son.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   God's intercessive journey's won.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   His kingdom spread from shore to shore.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Yes, it will.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Till we shall last and be no more.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   To him.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   To him shall endless praise be given,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and endless praises crown his head.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   His name, my sweet cherubim, shall
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   rise with every morning's sacrifice.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   He holds the crowns of every tongue
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   well on his love with sweetest song.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And infant voices shall proclaim their early blessings
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   on his name.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Let every creature rise and bring
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   honor and glory to our King.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Angels descend with songs again.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And earth repeat the loud amen.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   [MUSIC - "JESUS SHALL REIGN FOREVER"]
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Dwell on his love with sweetest song.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Let's do that now.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   [MUSIC - "JESUS SHALL REIGN FOREVER"]
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   [MUSIC - "WE KNOW THE DEEP, DEEP LOVE OF JESUS"]
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   (SINGING) We know the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   as a measure boundless free, rolling as a mighty ocean
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   in his fullness over me.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Underneath me, all around me is the current of your love,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   leading onward, leading onward to your glorious rest above.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Oh, the deep, deep love, all I need and trust
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   is the deep, deep love of Jesus.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   stretching waves from shore to shore.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   How he came to pay our ransom through the saving cross he
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   bore.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   How he washes o'er his loved ones,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   those he died to make his own.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   For when he's interceding, pleading now before the throne.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Oh, the deep, deep love, all I need and trust
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   is the deep, deep love of Jesus.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   [MUSIC - "WE KNOW THE DEEP, DEEP LOVE OF JESUS"]
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   (SINGING) Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus--
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   --are surpassing all the rest.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's an ocean full of blessing in the midst of every test.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   mighty Savior and friend.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   You will bring us all to glory where
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   your love could never end.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.500]   Never end.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   And oh, the deep, deep love, all I need and trust
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:58.000]   is the deep, deep love of Jesus.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Oh, the deep, deep love.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Oh, the deep, deep love, all I need and trust
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   is the deep, deep love of Jesus.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:27.500]   It's a love like no other.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:35.500]   This is how Paul talked about it in 2 Corinthians 5, verse 14.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:42.000]   For the love of Christ controls us.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Because we've concluded this, that one has died for all,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.500]   therefore all have died.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.500]   And he died for all, that those who live might no longer live
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.000]   for themselves, but for him who for their sake
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   died and was raised.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   It's not manipulation that controls us.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   It's not guilt that controls us.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   It's not pressure that controls us.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It's not a sense of our own importance that controls us.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   It's not a desire to do great things for God
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   that controls us.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It's nothing about us.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   It's the love of Christ.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And brothers, I pray that during this conference,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   our love for Jesus Christ grows to heights and depths
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   we didn't think were possible because he's the king.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   We go back to our churches with that love in our hearts
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   so we can sing together, "O Church Arise."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   O church, arise and put your armor on.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Give all the Christ our captain.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   For now we can say that they are strong
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   in the strength that God has given.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Let's still the faith and know the truth.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Let's stand against the devil's lies.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Let an army roll.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Let's battle Christ's love.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Reach out to those in darkness.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Our call to war, to love a happy soul,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   to praise the grace of God the Lord.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And when the storm that makes the wounded whole,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   we will fight with faith and valor.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And face the trials on every side.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   We know the outcome is secure.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And Christ will have the price for which he died,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   the inheritance of nations.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   We'll see the cross, where love and mercy meet,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   as the Son of God is stricken.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Then the sea is closed by a crush beneath his feet,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   for the Comforter has risen.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And as the stone is rolled away,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   and Christ emerges from the grave,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   his safe remarks, kept in which till the day,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   every eye and heart shall see him.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   [MUSIC - "SPIRIT OF GOD"]
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   So Spirit of God, your strength in every strife,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   give grace for every hurdle that we may run.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   With faith to win the prize, a servant good and faithful,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   as saints of old still line the way,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   retelling triumphs of his grace.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   We fear the cost, and how we're for the day,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   when with Christ we stand equal.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   As saints of old, as saints of old still line the way,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   retelling triumphs of his grace.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   We fear the cost, and hunger for the day,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   when with Christ we stand in glory.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Lord, one day we will stand with you in glory,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   and it will be all because of your grace,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   as you receive the praise and the honor that you alone are due.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Thank you that we can, by your spirit, give that to you now.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Amen.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Let's take our seats.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   There you are.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Well, in some ways, I feel like we could all go home.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   That was a real blessing for me, brother, and for many.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And I do pray that the riches of this opening address
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   may be with us for a long time.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   As you were speaking, I was thinking of Samuel Rutherford,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   who was once asked the question, what are the two favorite things
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   in your life?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And he said, Christ, and preaching Christ
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   to the salvation of souls.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I was thinking of Sinclair Ferguson also,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   who used to tell us at Westminster in his lectures,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   spend the best energies of your life knowing Christ,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   loving Christ, preaching Christ, and then go
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   do the work of an evangelist.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   It's out of the love of Christ that we really
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   are constrained to be faithful in evangelizing and doing
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   missions, not just to the nations out there,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   but bringing the nations to us as well,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   as we see in an audience like this or in various seminaries.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It's a wonderful thing to live in our day
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   when we have so many opportunities
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   to really do evangelism and missions,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   whether it's on an airplane, whether it's
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   going to a conference in a far country,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   whether it's actually serving in another country,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   whether it's the countries coming to us.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   It's a small world today.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And by the grace of God, we have opportunities
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   that our forefathers never had, many of them.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   So we need to do the work of an evangelist,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   looking to Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Turn with me, please, to Matthew 28, 18 through 20.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Abner also gave a wonderful introduction
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   to my text this morning.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Matthew 28, 18 through 20, the Great Commission.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   And, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Let's pray.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Lord God, Thou art astonishingly wonderful and beautiful
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   and glorious and altogether lovely, kind and holy,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   just and merciful.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   And we pray that Thou wilt be extolled by every address
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   in this conference.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Thy name lifted up, our souls encouraged,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   that we may experience at this conference
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   He, Jesus, must increase and we must decrease,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   and that the wonder of the gospel
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   may be increasingly astonishing,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   increasingly amazing grace to us all our lifetime,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   so that the longer we serve as ministers of the gospel,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   the more we would be astonished
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   that Thou wilt use us as ambassadors
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Humble us, Lord, and help us to live out of Thy promises,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   also this triple promise of the Great Commission.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Bless us now and use this promise
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   in its threefold dimension
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   to encourage us to go out and do the work of an evangelist.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   We ask Thy benediction upon us and upon every pastor here.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Lord, no matter what our troubles, our trials may be,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   may we look to Jesus and may we experience
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   that He is more than sufficient for our every need,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   for Thou dost do exceeding abundantly above
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   all that we could ask or think.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And for that, we praise Thy thrice holy name.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Well, these verses, obviously,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   are the concluding verses of the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And just like the end of a sermon
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   is often its most important part,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   so the end of a book, a gospel,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   is critical to understand the whole gospel.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And it goes without saying, I trust,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   that everything Matthew's been doing
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   has been leading up to these concluding words.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   All 28 chapters have been filling
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   and animating these final sentences.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And they give these sentences this triple promise,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   its force and its glory.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And so, no wonder these are very famous verses
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   called the Great Commission.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Because in them, Jesus is not only charging
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   His motley group of 11 to go out
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and win the world for Christ by the grace of Christ,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   but He's also speaking by extension to us today
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   and peculiarly so to ministers of the gospel.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   So, Matthew wants this Great Commission
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   to be sounding and resounding in our ears
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   as his gospel closes.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   He wants to show us what it means.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   He wants to fill us with the weight, the glory,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   the promise, the beauty of the exalted
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   and faithful Jesus who sends His ministers
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   out into the world to do this wonderful work
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   of baptizing, teaching all nations,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   making disciples by the grace of God
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   for His name and for His glory.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   So, Jesus is giving this Great Commission
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   at a pivotal moment in redemptive history.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   The long-anticipated Messiah has come.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   The end of the history remains to be consummated,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   but the gospel must be preached to all the nations
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   before He returns in judgment and glory.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   So, the disciples find themselves here
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   on the cusp of an exciting new epoch
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   in redemptive history.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Before Christ ascends to heaven,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   He instructs them about the mission of the church,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   and they see Him in His glorious resurrected body
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   commissioning them as the exalted King of kings
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   and Lord of lords to go forth
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   and to bring the gospel to all the nations.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   So, our theme in this address is,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   "Go ye, therefore, evangelizing the nations."
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   We could subtitle it "Christ's Triple Promise,"
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   a promise of divine authority,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   promise of divine delegation,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and a promise of divine assurance of His presence.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Authority, delegation, assurance.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   We already heard a fair bit about His divine authority
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   from this text, but notice in this verse
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   that the church has the authority, the responsibility,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   the right, the warrant to spread the gospel
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   because she receives this authority
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   from the radiant, majestic, glorious Lord of glory
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   who has supreme authority over the universe.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   He says, "All power is given unto me
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   in heaven and in earth."
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Today, of course, many people resist authority.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   They resent authority.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   But as heralds of the King of kings,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   we must declare the authoritative message of the King
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   no matter the cost.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And God is King through His Son.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Man is not.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   We are neither sovereign nor authoritative in ourselves,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   but we are heralds of God's truth.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Our business is only to state
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   what God has stated in His holy word.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   That's why Martin Luther once said,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   "As soon as I start preaching my own word
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   and not the words of Jesus recorded in the scriptures,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   you have every right to stand up and walk out of here
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   because I really have nothing to say."
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Divine authority stands behind this great commission.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And the beauty of this is that it's the King
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   who's giving this authority,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   this promise of authority entrusted to them
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   to go forth in His name.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   That's the foundation of the great commission.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Now, the disciples had been used to seeing Jesus,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   of course, for three years in His seminary
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   where He was training the 12.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   They had been used to seeing Him in His humiliation,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   suffering, in agony at times,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   needing to be alone, needing to pray,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   needing to groan to His Father,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   bearing the sins of His people upon His shoulders,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   upon His heart.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   But you see, now He's risen from the dead.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Now He's coming to them as the King,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   the King who has entered His kingdom,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   the King who's been rejected on every side
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   but now sits enthroned over all the heaven
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   and all the earth.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   The King with no rivals.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   He owns everything.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   He is Lord of all heaven and earth
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   and even hell by extension.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   He rules over Satan.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   He rules over men and women.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   He rules over, in His providence,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   every detail in your life and in mine.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And so they see Him,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   and they receive this promise of delegated authority
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   as the King of kings,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   as the one who has all authority in heaven and on earth.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And that's an allusion, isn't it, to Genesis 1.1,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Jesus referencing both the highest part of creation, heaven,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   and the lowest part of creation, earth,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   to designate the entire universe,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   the entire created order.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   So as we heard last hour,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   while the first Adam tragically failed
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   to exercise His authority over creation,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   the second Adam was victorious
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   and now rules over the universe
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   and tells His disciples, "Go everywhere
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   and tell the wonderful news
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   that I govern heaven and earth."
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   So as the Father sends His Son,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   so the Son now sends His disciples.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   The commission for the disciples to go out
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   comes from the Father, through the Son,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   giving them grace to do so.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   It's a Trinitarian authority in essence.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   It flows from the Father to Christ,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   from Christ to the head,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   to His body, the church,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   but is carried out by the Holy Spirit,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   whom He will soon send down
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   to give them the strength, the energy,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   the power, the wisdom, the insight
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   to go out and declare the name of Christ.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   So dear brother,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   you have the warrant,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   you have the right,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   you have the responsibility
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   to be the herald of the King of kings,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   to proclaim His kingdom to the world,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   to invite, yes more,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   to command men and women,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   teenagers, boys and girls,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   to repent from their sins
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   and to believe the gospel,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   the gospel of Jesus Christ alone,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   unto salvation.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   There's no more important vocatio
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   in all the world than that.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   When I was called to the ministry
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   at 16 years of age,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   my dad, who had been a ruling elder
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   in the church for 40 years,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   started to talk to me often about the ministry,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   but I still remember what he said to me,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   more than on one occasion.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   He said, "Remember, if God ever brings you
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   "into ministry to proclaim the name of Christ,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   "you have a vocation more important
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   "than living in the White House,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   "because the White House
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   "deals with the secular needs,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   "the physical needs of the citizens,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   "but you will be dealing with their spiritual needs
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   "that makes an eternity of difference."
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   So we have an authority, we have a right,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   we have an amazing calling.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   There's a 19th century pastor
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   by the name of Pison, and he said this.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   He said, "Sometimes I just sit in my study
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   "and I just clap my hands."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   I said, "How is it possible?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   "How is it possible
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   "that the God of the universe,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   "the Christ of heaven and earth,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   "how is it possible he could call me, sinful me,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   "to proclaim his name to the nations?"
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   It's unbelievable.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Who am I? Who are you?
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   This is more fit for angels' work,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   not for sinful men.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   It pleases God to use sinful men like you and me
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   to spread his gospel and to bless it
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   through the word of God.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Astonishing.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And then when you think about the universal scope
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   of this authority,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   that he is now exalted at the Father's right hand,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   and he has authority to teach as a prophet
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   through the Holy Spirit,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   moving his apostolic witnesses,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   moving his ministers today
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   so that the very words preserved
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   in the written word of scripture,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   we have the privilege of expounding,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   making them understandable,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   and telling people
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   that nothing is impossible for Christ to do.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   He has the authority to forgive sins,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Luke 5, 24,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   to rule his church, Matthew 18,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   to grant eternal life to sinners,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   John 1, John 17,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   to strengthen the church in her weakness,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   2 Corinthians 12.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   He has authority over nature, Mark 4,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   over political kingdoms, Psalm 2,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   over both the old and the new creation,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   1 Corinthians 15 and Revelation 22.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   No fragment of space or time
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   evades his dominion over the universe.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   The gates of hell cannot prevail against his kingdom,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   and you and I have the privilege
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   of being ambassadors of this glorious king.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Praise God for this authority.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Secondly, we have in this great commission
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   not only a promise of divine authority,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   but a promise of divine delegation.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   We see here that we must persevere
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   because Christ has delegated his authority
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   to make disciples to the church.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   So the great commission
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   means that we are commanded to make disciples.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   "Go ye therefore," verse 19 begins.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   "Go ye therefore."
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   You see, Christ's authority
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   is the foundation of the apostles' commission.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   We go out and make disciples
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   because Christ's ascension, his reign, and his delegation
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   promises us that this task will be successful.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   His word will not return to him void.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Yes, there are many times we feel it will fail,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   as we heard in the last address,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   and that we comfort ourselves with the fact, don't we,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   that we've been faithful to his word,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   we've proclaimed his word,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and it's a savior of death unto death
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   as well as life unto life.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   But there's also many other times
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   where we witness by the amazing grace of God
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   that going and making disciples
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   is not only not optional for the church,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   it's required, and we are to lead the church in that
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   and exemplify evangelization from the pope as we preach,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   as we pastor, as we counsel our people,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   we are teaching them consciously, subconsciously,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   how to evangelize.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   But we're doing this all knowing that one day,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   surrounding the throne of the Lamb,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   we will meet people for whom God has used us
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   and stewarded our resources in obedience to his command
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   to usher in their salvation.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   What a phenomenal thing it is
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   that we are co-laborers with the Holy Spirit
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   for the salvation of souls,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   and that this gospel will be preached
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   to the entire world before Christ returns.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Matthew 24.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Mark's version is even more emphatic.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Preach the gospel to every creature.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Matthew 16, 15.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   So as the people of God,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   we have the privilege of being part
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   of that magnificent enterprise.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Again, as we heard last hour,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   God doesn't need us whatsoever,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   but he invites us, he invites us
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   to participate in what he is doing in the world,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   something far bigger, far better,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   far greater than ourselves,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   something that will endure forever in eternal kingdom.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Now, as I get older,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   I'm sure those of you who are
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   getting in the upper end of your years,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   you start thinking a lot more, don't you,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   about whatever you do, whatever you say,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   can it last beyond you?
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   You start thinking about eternal consequences.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   You start thinking about how you use your time.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   I want to use as much of my time as possible
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   for things that can last to all eternity.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And that means I want to really work at evangelizing,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   because if sinners are saved by the grace of God,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   you see, that lasts to all eternity.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   So all the other kind of stuff in the ministry
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   that doesn't seem to last beyond our lifetime,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I want to delegate out as much as possible,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   because I want to use everything the Lord has given me
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   for eternity, for eternal consequences.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   And that is underscored here by this command.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Go forth, go forth.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Go here actually means travel, depart, venture out,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   proceed on a journey to execute a command.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Now, evangelism doesn't always mean going to another nation,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   although it may, physically,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   but it does mean that it requires preparation,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   which can be often uncomfortable, exhausting.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   It means hard work, preparing messages
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   based on the word of God, persevering in evangelism,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   searching, begging, crying out to the Lord for wisdom
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   to speak to that unconverted person sitting next to you
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   on an airplane or wherever you go.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   You're called to do the work of an evangelist.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Whenever I would go on vacation,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I had an old elder who would always,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   when he shaked my hand and wished me well,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   he was happy when we would have a week off,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   but he would always lean forward and he whispered in my ears,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   "Don't go incognito.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Remember, remember your master."
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   You see, yes, when you're on vacation,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   wherever you are, you're looking for ways.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   You see, every unconverted person is a mission field,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   and you're looking for such people,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   and you don't bombard them rudely or belligerently,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   as we also heard last hour, but you do.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   You do find ways of talking to them, getting to know them,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   and what do you do for work, what's your family like,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   and how many kids you have, grandkids,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   and then before you know it, they'll say,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   "Well, what do you do for work?"
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Well, you tell them you're a minister of the gospel,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   and you say, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   As soon as they feel that you care about them,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   they'll open up.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   85% of people sitting next to you on the airplane
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   will open up.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Maybe it's because of anonymity, I'm not sure,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   but you can get them to open up very easily,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   and you can talk to them about the Lord.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   So as a minister of the gospel, we don't only evangelize,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   we don't only have authority to go forth in our own church
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   and make disciples, but it becomes our nature
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   to think gospel, to speak gospel,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   to declare gospel wherever we go,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   both authoritatively from the pulpit
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   and unofficially in private.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   And so it should be our prayer.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   Every morning when we get up, shouldn't it?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   "Lord, please send someone my way today
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   "that I can bring the gospel to them.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   "Open a door that I can share the gospel
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   "with someone today."
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Now, that sharing of the gospel, Jesus says,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   is not just a going forth with my whole lifestyle,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   but it's also a making of disciples.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Go forth and teach all nations.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   The word teach here literally means to make disciples.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   And in biblical times, disciples were students
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   of a wise master.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   They were like apprentices.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Discipleship requires an attitude of humility
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   because it's a lifestyle of submission to the master.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   So unlike vocational apprentices,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   or students merely seeking instruction,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   disciples were lifestyle students.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   They trained to resemble their master,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   to imitate their master,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   to assimilate the teaching of their master.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   In other words, true discipleship, Jesus is saying,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   is inseparable from submission to all my words.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   And so we're to teach Christ.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   We're to teach his word.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Contrary to other forms of discipleship,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Christ calls us to view him,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   not merely as a way of life,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   or a guide to life,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   but as life itself.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   As life itself.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   So discipleship involves taking the yoke of the master,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   which is easy and light compared to what he bore,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   and disciples are then bound together with their master
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   and are identified with him.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   And that's why,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   when we act like a minister of the gospel on the pulpit,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   but don't act in a corresponding manner in private with people,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   act in a way not befitting a minister,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   we are actually unraveling what we're doing on the pulpit.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Christ himself is the initiator
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   in the disciple-master relationship,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   summoning us to discipleship through the call of the gospel,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   and then we are to go out and make disciples in his name
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   and by the power of his spirit.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   So the goal of discipleship
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   is not just for us to pass on intellectual knowledge to someone else,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   and not just for ourselves to know about Jesus intellectually,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   but the goal of discipleship is that we ourselves
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   are with Jesus,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   and know Jesus experientially, internally,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   and love him,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   and that it oozes out from us,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   that the savor of Christ
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   goes out from us, like it says of Paul,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   the smell of Christ was upon him.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   I was really convicted when I read in Thomas Boston's diary
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   that he made a resolution to the Lord,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   and here's what he said,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   "I make a holy resolve that by the grace of the spirit
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   "I will leave the smell of Christ behind
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   "in every preaching or pastoral duty,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   "but also in every relationship I have
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   "with anyone in this world."
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   To be a godly minister
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   means to be conscious of the fact,
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   not out of false, pietistic, negative motives,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   but out of true, pietistic, godly motives,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   "I want to leave the smell of Christ behind
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   "wherever I go."
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Because making disciples
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   isn't only about imparting knowledge to people.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   It's not only talking about Jesus,
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   but it's modeling him.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   It's showing who he is.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   By the way I talk, by the way I pray,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   prayer is a very important part of discipleship,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   especially as a pastor.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   You know, many people have a hard time praying,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   really a hard time praying.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   God has gifted you with some words,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   and when you pastor people and you disciple them,
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   don't close off that meeting
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   with just some little short 30-second prayer
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   as if, "Oh, we've got to pray at the end."
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   No, pray earnestly.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Pray through what you've talked about.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Pray with compassion and passion,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   and that may well be the most important part of your visit.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   That may be the most important part of your disciple-making,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   because they will be moved by your prayer
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   to realize what they're missing
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   and become jealous of it and seek the face of God.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   So disciple-making does not mean we call anyone to follow us,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   but instead we call them to become fellow disciples,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   and we point them to the person, the words, and the deeds
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   of Jesus Christ as our Lord,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   but we do so in such a way that they can see the Lord in us.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Now that's a humbling thing,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   and we're all going to say we've come far short of that,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   but is it our passion, is it our goal,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   is it our longing that people can see Jesus Christ in us?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Go ye forth and make disciples,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   and then baptize them in the name of the Father
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   The repetition of the connective and preposition
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   in the original Greek makes the clause distributive--
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   in the name of the Father, the name of the Son,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   and the name of the Holy Ghost.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And so the invocation of each name of the Trinity in baptism
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   implies two things.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   First, it indicates that the one baptizing
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   does so in the authority of the triune God,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   and second, it indicates that the one baptized
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   does so upon profession of faith in the triune God.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   So it's bookended, and both ends, by teaching,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   and through the invocation of the threefold name in baptism,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   we declare that the gospel is Trinitarian,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   and faith in the gospel must be a Trinitarian faith.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   We have a Trinitarian gospel,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   and we better have that in our preaching as well,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   or we have no gospel at all.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   The triune God is the foundation of our salvation,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   willed by the Father, accomplished by the Son,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   applied by the Spirit.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   And so we teach with our words, we teach with our life,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   we teach with our prayers, we teach with our visits,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   we teach with our compassion,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   we teach even on those phone calls we make,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   asking people how they're doing
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   and reminding them of certain texts,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   and they go search them out in the Bible,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   and often they're blessed, because the Word is powerful.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   We spread the Word everywhere we go.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Disciple.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Make disciples.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   And then finally,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   this wonderful, great commission
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   gives us the promise, the promise,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   of divine presence.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   "Lo," verse 20, "I am with you always,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   "even unto the end of the world."
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   And notice it's in the emphatic tense in the Greek, isn't it?
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   "I Myself, I the Lord of glory,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   "I now the exalted Savior,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   "to whom all authority is given in heaven and earth,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   "who am going to now ascend into the heavens
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   "and rule over the nations from the right hand of the Father."
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Daniel 7, 14.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   "I Myself am with you
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   "as you go out in My name
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   "to disciple the nations."
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Christ is present with us, with the Church,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   both in His divine omnipresence
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   and in His communion with the Church
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   through His Word by the Spirit,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   present with His people according to His divinity,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   as well as His humanity at the right hand of the Father.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   And so what that means is
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   He will never, no, never, no, never, Hebrews 13,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   forsake or leave us.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   So whatever we are going through at the present moment,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   whatever we don't understand,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   whatever we say, "Lord, this is confusion.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   "Why is this happening to me?
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   "Why do I have to go through this trouble with this person?"
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Or, "Why did that family just leave the Church
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   "and I only have a small church to begin with?"
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Or, "Why so much agony, so much trial,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   "so much emptying process
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   "from vessel to vessel in the ministry?"
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   The answer is,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   "What I do now, thou knowest not,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   "but thou shalt know hereafter.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   "And all things work together for good
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   "to them that love God."
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   God wants to break you.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   God wants to weaken you.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   God wants to make you small in yourself,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   just a broken clay pot,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   so that He can get all the honor and glory
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   through the ministry of His Word through you.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   Because if you become something,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   it will go the wrong way.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   It will go the wrong way.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   We need to be humble,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   and God knows exactly
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   how many afflictions to place upon us,
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   how much our shoulders can bear.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   As the Puritan George Downing put it,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   "God doesn't measure afflictions He puts on us
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   "by our desires,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   "but by the strength He gives us to bear."
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Have you ever noticed that most of the men of God
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   who were greatly used in church history
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   were also men that were sorely afflicted
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   in one way or another?
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   You see, God afflicts His servants
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   to make them exactly the kind of servants
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   He wants them to be,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   and then He reassures them in all their need,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   "I will be with you.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   "I will be with you.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   "I will be with you.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   "My presence will never fail you."
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   What you don't understand now, it's okay.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   You'll understand it later.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   And how critical that is in our lives.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   I've been broken.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   I've been broken in ministry.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   You've been broken.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   And at the end of the day,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   we do have to say, don't we,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   it is good for us to have been afflicted.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Because Christ is with us.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   When are we closest to Him?
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   When do we feel His presence the most?
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Most of the time when we are afflicted the most.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   "I will be with you.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   "Always.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   "Always.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   "Always."
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Now, it wasn't that God wasn't always with His people
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   in Old Testament times, actually.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   He was always with His people from the beginning.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   He was with Israel.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   He was dwelling in the tents of the tabernacle,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   residing in the temple.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   He was above them.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   He was beyond them.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   He was over them.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   But He was also with them.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   God is a God who is Emmanuel in Christ with us.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   In the very opening chapter of Matthew 1,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   Matthew said, "Emmanuel in the flesh
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   "has come for this very purpose,
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   "to be with us."
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   But you see, now there's a difference.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   Now it's bigger, fuller, richer, augmented,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   because now, now you see
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   the radiant living King who stands before His disciples,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Jesus Christ, in whom all the promises of God
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   are eternally and irrevocably fulfilled,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   the God who has always been and always will be,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   the God who's borne the sins and put away sin of His people
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   and risen from the dead and who's going to glory,
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   this God says, "I will be with you forever in glory."
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Oh, what a faithful Jesus.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   You know, the thief on the cross,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   just ask Jesus for one thought.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Just remember me when you come into your kingdom.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   And what did Jesus say?
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   "today thou shalt be with me in paradise."
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Thou with me.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   You with me.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   That's the essence of what every Christian desires,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   and that's the essence of what every minister ought to desire.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   That's fulfilling beyond anything else.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Thou with me, this morning when I get up.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Thou with me when I preach on the Lord's Day.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Thou with me when I'm in a struggle
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   with some member of the church who's being very belligerent.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Thou with me in family difficulties.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Thou with me in heartaches, in sickness, in health.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   I will be with you always.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   Be faithful to my word.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   Go make disciples, and I will be with you always.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Heidelberg Catechism puts it so well when it asks the question,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   "But what benefits do I receive from him going into heaven?
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   "He'll be so far away."
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   And it says, "Oh, no, no, no.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   "With respect to his Godhead, his majesty,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   "his grace, and his spirit."
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Four things.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   "He is at no time absent from us."
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   No time absent from us.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   What a delight it is to know that he's here with us now.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   That we seek no favor but his favor now.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   That we have no joy except in doing his will now.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   Only redeemed humanity enjoys this blissful presence of God.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   When I evangelize people, I love to tell them that.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   I love to say to them,
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   "You know, I've had the privilege of meeting tens of thousands,
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   "hundreds of thousands of children of God
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   "all around this globe,
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   "and I've never met a single one
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   "who was sorry they were a Christian,
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   "who was sorry they spent so much time in the Bible,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   "who was sorry they spent so much time in prayer,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   "who was sorry they spent so much time
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   "evangelizing someone else."
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   You're missing the purpose of life, my friend.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   You're missing the joy of a personal relationship
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   with Jesus Christ,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   who's always with his people.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Jesus Christ is at no time absent from you, dear brother,
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   even when your faith does not actively grasp him.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   Even in your darkest hours, he's beside you.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   Like Robert Murray McShane said,
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   "How would you pray differently
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   "if when you bent your knees,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   "you knew that Jesus was standing right beside you?"
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   His answer was, "He is standing right beside you.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   "He's omnipresent. He's right there.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   "He's right there.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   "He's at no time absent from you."
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   So the church can move ahead.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   You as a minister can move ahead in your work
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   with great confidence,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   for all the powers of darkness cannot destroy the church.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   Church is the only institution
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   that's survived for thousands of years,
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   and it will go on to the end,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   because the Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   the one to whom all authority is given,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   the resurrected King of glory,
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   the beautiful Lord of lords, is with you.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   Now, that assurance of his presence
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   is also a promise of enduring presence,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   even unto the end of the world,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   or as the Greek has it more accurately,
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   all the days unto the consummation of the age.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   Do you notice in this text the fourfold all?
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   What God is, God is all of what he is.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   Notice that Christ first possesses
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   all authority in the world.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   For this reason, the church must disciple all the nations
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   by baptizing and teaching them to observe
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   all the things that Christ has commanded,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   and he will be with us all the days
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   unto the end of time itself.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   What does that teach us?
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   Well, the four uses of the word all teach us
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   that the Great Commission is a time-spanning,
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   globe-straddling project of comprehensive disciple-making
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   that will keep the church busy and blessed
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   until the Lord returns.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   So Christ declared that his presence would endure
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   with his church until the consummation of the age.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   So we live, yes we live in the now, not yet,
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   we live in the overlapping of two ages,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   but we're soon going to experience,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   sooner maybe than we think,
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   the age to come where we will be with Christ
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   and he will be all and in all,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   and we will glory in his fullness.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   We will be spiritual brides of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   and have intimate communion with him
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   beyond the intimacy of a man and his wife.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Not physical, spiritual.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   There'll be a oneness with Christ
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   that we will consciously experience in glory
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   that will go beyond our comprehension.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   And so we wait eagerly for that day.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   We long for that day to come
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   where the church will be one multitude,
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   where the promise will be fulfilled
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   that all the church given to him
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   will be gathered together, all the elect.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   Not one chair in heaven will be empty.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   Every place is reserved.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   Everyone will be brought there
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   and all good will be walled in
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   and all evil will be walled out.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   And heaven, as Jonathan Edwards said in that famous sermon,
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   will be a perfect world of perfect love.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   So brother, when you're discouraged in the ministry,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   remember your future.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Remember the assurance of Christ's promise.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   He'll be with you always through the trial
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   but also to the end and into everlasting glory
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   where he will be all and in all
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   and where you will be, by the grace of God,
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   as holy as he is holy
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   and where you'll never have to take your eyes off of him
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   and you'll never be ashamed of him.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   He'll never be ashamed of you.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   You will love him perfectly
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   and he will love you perfectly.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   You know, speaking of Samuel Rutherford,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   he has this famous letter to a friend
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   where he says, "Here on this earth,
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   "we often get only glimpses and glances
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   "and blinks of Christ
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   "because we're so often drawn away
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   "to other secular concerns.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   "But there in heaven,
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   "he will be all the focus
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   "and you and your loved ones
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   "and people from your church
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   "will all recognize one another in heaven.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   "We will not be focusing on each other
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   "but we will be focusing on him.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   "But our joy will be multiplied
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   "as you will focus upon him
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   "even with those you've ministered unto."
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   You know why I keep thinking of Rutherford,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   but Rutherford said,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   "For other souls from Anwerth with me,
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   "from my pastorate with me in heaven
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   "will make heaven a double heaven for me.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   "What joy, what joy
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   "to worship the lamb forever
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   "with those with whom you've been bounded
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   "with spiritual bonds here on earth.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   "I will be with you always
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   "even to the end
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   "and then forever.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   "Christ will be all and in all."
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   You know, here in this life,
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   we just,
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   we want to know Christ better, don't we?
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   We want to know so much more about him.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   We want to experience so much more of him.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   But we're so often hampered
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   by so many distractions.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   "But there I will gaze upon him,"
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   Revelation 19 says.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   "Gaze upon him
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   "and never have to look away again."
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   The altogether lovely one.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   Had a couple students walk into my study
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   one day from Nigeria,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   a few years back now.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   And one was a third year student,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   the other had just arrived the day before.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   And he came to introduce him to me.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   And as he introduced him,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   he noticed, and I noticed,
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   that the new student just kind of
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   looked at me like this.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   He just, he couldn't stop and look at me.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   And the older student said, "No, no, no."
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   He said, "You've got things all wrong here."
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   He said, "In Nigeria, it's an insult
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   "to look your teacher too long in the face.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   "But in America, it's an insult
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   "not to look him in the face."
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   And so then the poor guy tried
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   to look at me a little longer.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   And was like...
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   But isn't that the way you often feel?
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   Oh, that I could just gaze upon him.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   Be enamored with him.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   And grow in him.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   Well, one day, it will happen.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   More and more, and more and more.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   As John Howell said, "Tis cumulative glory
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   "to be with Christ forever."
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   So if you have this bottle of water
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   and you had a bottle that had twice the capacity,
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   see, in heaven, both will be totally full.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   Your cup will run over.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   But the capacity of knowing Christ
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   and growing in Christ
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   and delighting in the beauty of Christ
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   and communing with Christ
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   and relishing Christ
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   and living Christ
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   will just keep growing and growing.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   Forever.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   And it will never end.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   So this little mere life,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   this little short life,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   is just the beginning
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   of everlasting glory
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   of the fullness of Christ.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   So do the work of an evangelist.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   Press on, live for him.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   And know, too,
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   as Paul says,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   in fact, the New Testament says 13 times
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   that God's faithful servants,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   ministers of the gospel in particular,
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   will receive a reward for their labor,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   a gracious reward,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   on that great day
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   and for all eternity.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   What a wonderful thing.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   His presence is everything.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   No matter what he sends my way,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   if I can commune with him in it,
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   it is well with my soul.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   What a promise.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   So we take this triple promise
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   and we use it,
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   divine authority,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   divine delegation,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   divine presence,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   as we go out
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   and evangelize.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   And how do we do that then?
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   And so what I want to do
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   in my remarks now,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   as I draw to some applications
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   in closing,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   I want to look with you
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   half at this address
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   and then half tomorrow evening
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   when I address you
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   on the role of the Holy Spirit in evangelism.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   I want to look at some practical ways
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   that we evangelize
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   to the nations
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   through our own ministries
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   and through other ways
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   to reach out
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   and how we can stir up our churches
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   also to take on some of these ideas.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   And many of them you know very well,
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   but maybe some of them
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   you haven't thought of
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   in terms of,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   well, this is evangelization.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   Let me just give you
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   a few of the typical ones today,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   traditional approaches,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   and then tomorrow night
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   I want to do some more
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   of the modern approaches
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   very briefly.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   So first of all
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   is a church-based evangelism
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   where you go out and make disciples
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   through the church.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   That begins with public worship,
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   doesn't it?
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   Actually, every sermon we preach
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   in one way or another
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   should have evangelistic notes in it.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   Now, of course,
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   if the text is more evangelistic than usual,
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   the bulk of the sermon will be evangelistic.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   But we just don't assume
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   that everyone in our church is saved,
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   that all the boys and girls are saved,
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   that all the adults are saved.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   We preach in a discriminatory way,
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   in an evangelistic way,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   we distinguish the precious from the vile,
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   we teach people
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   how the Holy Spirit converts sinners,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   and we teach people
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   the necessity of repentance
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   and faith in Christ.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   So preaching is a primary tool
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   for evangelism,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   for going out and making disciples.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   Most people who've been saved
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   have been saved in world history
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   through preaching.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   This is the most common way.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   And so we need to realize
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   that we're not just,
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   we're doing that, of course,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   but we're not just comforting God's people
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   in our sermons,
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   we're also reaching the unsaved,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   and even as we do that,
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   even as we preach evangelistically,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   we're also stirring up God's own people
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   to examine themselves
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   and become more and more assured,
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   "Yes, I do have some of those fruits of the Spirit
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   "the Bible speaks about.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   "By their fruits ye shall know them."
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   And then, of course,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   you need to spearhead in your church
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   support for mission work
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   all around the world,
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   financial support,
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   prayer support,
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   encouragement support.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   You need to talk about the Great Commission,
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   and you need to talk to perhaps a young man
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   who really feels called to ministry about,
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   "Well, don't you perhaps feel to go out
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   "and to bring the gospel to unreached people groups?"
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   You may suggest those things as a minister to,
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   now God has to confirm it,
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   but there should be an eagerness,
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   there should be a zeal in our ministry
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   that is conveyed to our people,
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   "Go ye forth, therefore, and bring the gospel."
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   And then there should be all kinds
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   of evangelistic community outreaches,
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   whether it's a free conference,
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   whether it's a vacation Bible school,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   whether it's a periodical
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   you spread out in the neighborhood,
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   whether you send men to preach at a homeless shelter
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   or a soup kitchen or a nursing home or prisons
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   or juvenile detention facilities or nursing homes.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   Make use of all the opportunities
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   from within your church to go out
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   and bring the gospel to your community.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   And door to door.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   I don't know if that's possible in every area,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   but door to door was a New Testament way
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   of spreading the gospel with a couple people going
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   and having materials with you
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   and just speaking to people from heart to heart,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   mind to mind.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   Sunday school evangelism.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   In our church, we modeled it after the MetTab
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Sunday school program in London, England,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   and what a blessing.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   A couple thousand children have gone
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   through our Sunday school program over the years,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   and some of them have been saved.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   Many not so.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   It's not easy work.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   85% of them come from broken homes
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   and many of them are not well-behaved.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   But when you have a Sunday school program
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   and you bring children into the church,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   young children, with proper permission
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   from their parents, signed statements,
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   everything done in a very orderly way,
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   and you bring them the gospel,
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   it will also be rewarding for your own people.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   It will bond your own people together
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   in the gospel faith as they minister together
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   to the children of the neighborhood.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   And who can tell?
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   Eternity will reveal what it will do.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   And then there's open air evangelism.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   There are many places you can still preach
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   in many countries today.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   In the open air, people can hear you
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   and you can have people help you,
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   handing out things, talking with people.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   Who can tell what the Lord will do?
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   And a big one in my life is travel evangelism
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   because I'm playing so often.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   And I had a fellow professor in Grand Rapids
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   who told me, he was an elderly man at the time,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   when I was in my 30s, and he said,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   "Wherever I go, wherever I go,
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   "be it a bus, a train, a plane,
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   "or wherever I meet people,
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   "if I sit next to someone,
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   "no matter how busy I am,
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   "I have a holy resolution with God.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   "I will try to evangelize that person."
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   It's astonishing.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   It is astonishing when you make that effort.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   And the first few times, you feel a bit awkward, perhaps.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   But as you learn how to engage people
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   in conversation more effectively
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   and then move it over into,
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   "Well, what do you believe?"
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   Or, "What church do you go to?"
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   "Well, I don't go to church."
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   But you talk to them about the Lord
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   and what he means to you
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   and what the Word of God means
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   and what a blessing it is to have a guide for life
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   and what I do on planes is I almost always,
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   not every time, but where there's an opening,
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   I will send them books in the mail afterward,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   free of charge.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   And even if they don't want to read them,
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   they promised me on the spot they'll read them,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   so I send them.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   You never know what it will do.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   Never know what it will do.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   And I could tell you many stories of things that it did do
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   and, of course, many abject failures,
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   and I'm on my part as well,
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   even though, as I was reassured last hour,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   that it's not really a failure.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   When you get rejected,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   it's really them rejecting the Lord.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   But there's one time in your life
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   you're sitting next to that person.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   There's one more soul that's not saved, most likely.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   You've got to talk to them.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   That's your responsibility.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   Go forth, everywhere you go,
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   proclaiming the gospel.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   And then there's media-based evangelism,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   be it through tracts,
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   and I would suggest when you give out tracts,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   don't just hand them out like they used to do in ages past,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   but try to talk with the people you hand them out to.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   Try to build a relationship.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   That's more effective in general than the other way.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   Radio, internet evangelism.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   There are so many possibilities
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   for your church to get involved,
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   or just even putting your sermons in your church
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   on Sermon Audio or some other place
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   where they can be listened to by hundreds
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   or even thousands,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   who can tell what the Lord will do.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   So use these forms of evangelism
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   and whatever other ones you come up with,
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   and then tomorrow I'm going to talk to you
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   about some more personal forms of evangelism
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   and community forms as well.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   So go forth and preach the gospel.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   Go forth and share the gospel.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   Go forth in every area of your life
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   and ask, "How can I reach as many people as possible
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   "with the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   "to his glory and their salvation good?"
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   I'm going to pray,
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   and then I'm going to just talk to you about books
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   for just a few minutes.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   Great God of heaven,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   please bless this talk
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   and do grant, Lord,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   that we would go forth as evangelists,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   do the work of an evangelist,
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   according to thy divine promise,
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   according to thy divine delegation,
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   and according to thy precious divine presence.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   Help us to truly be ambassadors for Christ 24/7,
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   to never fail to bring the gospel
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   when opportunities avail us.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   And humble us beneath this gospel
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   and beneath the calling we have
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   to be gospel bringers, gospel sharers,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   gospel declarers, gospel preachers,
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   wherever possible.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   Help us to be faithful even unto death.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   Well, you know, under the tent out there,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   there are a number of wonderful books.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   I wanted to mention just a couple of them to you
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   that are evangelistic and helpful.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   One is "Turn and Live," "Turn and Live,"
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   by Nathaniel Vincent.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   This is a Puritan.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   It's in a group of books called
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   "Puritan Treasures for Today," PTT.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   And we're doing 200 of these
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   for Reformation Heritage Books,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   and the goal is to have them translated
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   in the world's 25 top languages,
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   and then we're going to distribute them free
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   in all these different countries and languages.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   And obviously we're raising donations for this task,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   but we're also editing each one of these Puritan titles
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   so that a 13 or 14-year-old could read them.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000]   Every antiquated word is replaced
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   with a modern equivalent.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   So gone are the days, forever gone are the days
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   when people say, "I can't read the Puritans."
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   16 of these.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   16 of these are now available.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   You can find them in the tent.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   There's a special price if you buy all 16.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   You'll love them, but they're just short books,
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   50 to 150 pages.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   They're in all different subjects.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   "Triumphing Over Sinful Fear" by John Flavel.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   "The Blessed Redeemer" by William Perkins
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   is the last one.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   They are so rich and yet so simple
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   and so evangelistic that I recommend them to you.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   "The Gospel of Jesus Christ" by Paul Washer.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   This is just a wonderful booklet
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   on what the gospel is.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   Longer than a track, I think it's about 25 pages,
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   and it just gives you the basics.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   And we sell these in packages of 10
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   and give them out to your church,
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   put them in your church vestibule.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   God's used them mightily.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   Over 2 million of these have been printed and spread.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   And then for you as a minister,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   "The Complete Gathered Gold" compiled by John Blanchard.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   This came out a few weeks ago.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   It's the best book of quotations,
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   Reformed, Puritan, contemporary quotations,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   I believe has ever been on the market.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   And you're going to want to have that as a pastor
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   to help you put more fizz in the coke of your sermons
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   and be able to get a little more life in there.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   And that will help you evangelistically as well.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   And then don't forget the Family Worship Bible Guide
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   because that is a way to evangelize your own family.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   And we often forget that the most important part
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   of evangelism is to start with our own household.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   And what this does, as a father,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   it gives you the two major takeaways
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   with a question at the end of each of them
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   from every single Bible chapter.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   So when you read a chapter each day,
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   and I hope you do family worship,
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   then you just read these two paragraphs,
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   ask these two questions, and it generates discussion.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   And by the time you get through the whole Bible
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   in two, three years with this,
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   you will have spoken to your children or your grandchildren
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   about every subject under the sun
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   because the Bible speaks about every subject under the sun.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   So I call this the best evangelistic tool.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   It's by far our number one best-selling book,
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   but the best evangelistic tool for the family.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   It will help you, Dad, Grandpa, Pastor,
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   reaching out to people in your own family
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   and your extended family.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   God bless you. Thank you so much.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   [applause]
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   Speaking of books,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   you have a box of giveaway books for you
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   for the conference.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   You can pick them up anytime in the conference bookstore
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   between Wednesday and Thursday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   and then Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.,
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   and the location is in the southeast corner
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   of the book tent, just so you know.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   And also, speaking of books,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   not only are there books in the book tent,
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   but also we have Grace Books,
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   which is adjacent to the church office to my right,
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   knowing that.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   And as you're walking over there,
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   you might notice that your shoes look shabby.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   It's very possible.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   And so we have a remedy for you about that.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   You can drop off your shoes to the new option
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   that you have at the shoe--
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   let me say that quickly--shoe shine station,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   and that is you can drop off your shoes anytime
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   or extra pairs of shoes that you might want shined
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   on Thursday or Friday
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   and pick them up by the end of the day,
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   which is pretty amazing.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   It comes with a new shoe travel bag and shoe inserts.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   So please refrain, however, from walking around barefoot.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   [laughter]
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   This is Southern California.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   I get that, but the '60s are way behind us.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   And also know that there is a seminar today
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   at 1 o'clock in the Master Seminary Library
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   titled "Called to Preach--
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   Discerning the Desire for Pastoral Ministry."
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   For all of you or any of you that are interested,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   all other seminars will begin at 2 o'clock.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   And here's the good part.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   Lunch today is Stonefire Grill,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   which means tri-tip.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   And so it's going to be a glorious time.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   Please refrain from eating or drinking
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   inside the worship center or the chapel,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   and please avoid parking on Roscoe Boulevard,
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   otherwise your car will be towed.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   Let me pray.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   Father, allow these men to have a rich fellowship time together
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   over this wonderful food,
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   and allow their speech with one another
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   to be filled with great gratitude,
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   knowing Your Son stands right beside them.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   We ask this in Christ's name, amen.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   [indistinct chatter]
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   [indistinct chatter]
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
