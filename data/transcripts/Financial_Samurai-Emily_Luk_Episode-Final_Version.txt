[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.800]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast. In this episode, I have a
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.680]   special guest with me, Emily Luck, co-founder and CEO of Plenty, a wealth platform for modern
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.080]   couples. Welcome to the show, Emily.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.280]   Thanks for having me, Sam.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.240]   In this episode, I would love to talk to you about your journey from college to your first
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.800]   job to working at one of the largest private startups and then leaving. I've been in the
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.640]   Bay Area since 2001, and I've seen so many people join startups, make it big, but most
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   don't make it big. Some join the big giants like Google and Facebook and Apple, and they
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.200]   end up very wealthy over a 10- to 20-year period. I'd love to understand your thought
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.960]   process and how you decided where to join after college and then your career trajectory
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.960]   after that.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.960]   Yeah, more than happy to chat through it. I think, you know, for me, it really did start
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.600]   with actually my family upbringing because both my parents and my grandparents, they'd
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.080]   each built companies for almost 20 years. And so for the longest time, that actually,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.000]   to me, was the definition of starting a company. When I was in university, I actually almost
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.080]   dropped out because I was just ready to start working. Instead, I ended up deciding to graduate
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.680]   early, but I had a chance to start working in venture capital, which for me, the VC world
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.480]   was so incredibly important because I was always an ideas person all the way through
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.980]   growing up. But being in venture and the reason why I decided to start my career in venture,
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.760]   it gave me an opportunity to have a really analytical framework to understand what ideas
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.120]   can go the distance, what is something that I could potentially think about, you know,
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.600]   decades in my life of building and really think about that from the perspective of an
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.000]   investor. I think one of the things that at the time someone had given me some really
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.940]   great advice and one quote that really stuck was, "Unlike an investor where you can make
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.820]   so many different investments, when you're working for a company, you're really making
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.020]   one bet at a time." And so if anything, it's even more important to think about whether
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.960]   or not that company is worth betting on.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.840]   As a venture capitalist, this is interesting because I think joining the VC industry after
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.680]   college is one of the most coveted types of industries to join along with investment banking,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.000]   management consulting. How did you get the opportunity to join VC? And initially, you
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.360]   know, how did you gain the confidence to be a VC? Because I've spoken to many VCs and
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.080]   there are builder VCs, VCs who've started companies so they know the operational, what
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.960]   it takes and also fundraising and all that. And then there are the MBA graduate case study
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.280]   VCs who have never built a company. And then, but then many of them still end up being successful
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.280]   investors.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.960]   Yeah. So for me, I've been doing small businesses, running little side hustles all of my life.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.040]   Probably the more meaningful business was I started a company when I was in high school.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.360]   It was selling customized clothing. It was a way to circumvent the fact that for public
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.520]   schools you had approved vendors, but student councils could circumvent that. And so I've
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.960]   been building things like that pretty much all of my teenage years. And so I already
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.760]   had a track record, I think, of thinking about that framework of ultimately you could buy
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.920]   something or you produce something and what it costs you to use in order to produce that
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.680]   good or service is going to be less than whatever you're ultimately selling, hopefully a higher
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.560]   quality product or service for.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.800]   So that framework was something that was fairly deeply ingrained. I was really lucky that
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.960]   I had that chance to start off in venture. I was 20 years old at the time when I started.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.400]   And during that time, actually, how I got that role was because I had worked on starting
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.200]   companies throughout university as well. And I got involved with a student run venture
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.760]   fund. This was like back in the days before dorm room fund even existed. And we raised
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.160]   a small amount of money from a few other corporations with the intention. And we actually did invest
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.800]   into some student run startups. During that time, we also ran a number of different pitch
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.880]   competitions for students to actually pitch other VCs. And I was one of the two people
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.600]   who was leading that at the time. And so when we invited actually some VCs to come to these
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.840]   pitch nights, I ended up meeting not only the person I end up going to work for, but
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.720]   actually also the person who is now currently one of our board members for plenty.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   Oh, wow. That's fascinating. So it sounds like starting young and getting going and
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.080]   getting your hands and feet wet is one of the key strategies to getting into VC.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.000]   I definitely would say that there's just no substitute for spending time amongst people
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.280]   who are in, you know, that world. And one thing that I have seen is I have, you know,
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.160]   talked to many people who have come out of the business schools or the business programs
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.400]   and asked how to start. And there's actually a much lower barrier to entry than some people
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.380]   might think, because there's so many of these different events that are happening nowadays
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.600]   where you just go to the event. There's, you know, tech meetups and all of that where there's
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.960]   other founders, other VCs. And it's a great environment to be able to learn from, but
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.560]   then also meet people. And I think one thing that's also been really helpful as a guiding
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.680]   principle for me my whole career has been that if you're looking to meet someone because
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.640]   you need someone's help or introduction right now, that's probably like a little late. You
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.480]   really want to start getting to know people far before you ever even have an inkling of,
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.000]   oh, maybe I actually might need an introduction from them one day. So it really gives them
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.600]   time to build a more authentic relationship.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah, it's kind of like if you've been laid off from a firm and you start pinging people
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.400]   on LinkedIn, it's probably too late. You need to be cultivating those relationships far
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.280]   in advance with no ask beforehand.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.120]   Exactly. I think that's where you build the real relationships where people are willing
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.040]   to go to bat for you because they don't feel like you're there because you need something
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.240]   for them right away.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.360]   Right. So how long were you doing VC before you moved on to, was it Stripe? What was your
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.760]   road map after that?
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.960]   Yeah. So the original plan had been to stay in venture for a couple of years. I would
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.880]   say I've always had these three to five year plans and never actually followed through
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.280]   on the entirety of those plans. And life happens and I've kind of moved along with whatever
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.960]   comes through. And so I stayed in venture for about a year and a half. But right around
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.600]   that time, I started noticing over the course of my first year in venture that a lot of
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.040]   companies that were, I was in venture in Canada, and most of the companies we invested in were
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.360]   Canadian companies expanding into the U.S. market. And one thing I noticed was that most
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.200]   of our most interesting companies that also, to me, had the savviest technical teams, had
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.440]   the most interesting businesses or business models, they almost all use Stripe. And so
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:13.760]   one thing led to another. I had an individual that I'd known for a long time. He coincidentally
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.480]   started working at Stripe and I just went to go visit. And I ended up joining them for
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.720]   a happy hour. He was like, "Yeah, come out to our office. I'll be working there. Let's
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.120]   catch up." And then one thing led to another. Turns out an individual that I'd sat next
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.480]   to was actually one of the business recruiters. I didn't think too much of it. We had mostly
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.200]   just been talking about hobbies and interests. And then a couple weeks later, I got a message
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.120]   from them about the fact that they were starting to build out their business teams and asking
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.320]   if it was something that I'd consider moving out to San Francisco for.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.600]   What year was that? And at the time, do you recall what Stripe's valuation was?
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:56.920]   Yeah. So I moved out to join Stripe in 2015. And at that time, they had just closed that
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:03.680]   $5 billion round and they were about a 150, 200 person startup at that time.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.560]   Wow. So $5 billion. And so at the time, so you said you noticed the companies you were
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.960]   investing in were using Stripe more often. What was, I guess, the selling or the value
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.040]   proposition that made you say, "Okay, I'm going to change jobs and leave my city behind
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.720]   to come to San Francisco"?
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.480]   I think one of the things that really jumped out for me for Stripe was at the time, there
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.240]   weren't really companies that were building great APIs for financial infrastructure. Stripe
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.880]   was really the first company to come along and do that. And when I actually started looking
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.800]   through the API documentation to really understand how revolutionary what they did truly was,
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.440]   if you had gone into a process where you're like, "I built a great product," or, "I
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.840]   have a company and we're trying to offer this service, and I'm just trying to get paid
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.960]   for my product or service." If you worked with most of the companies that accepted credit
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.040]   cards at that time, it was a convoluted process where the product didn't even work very well.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.280]   The documentation was terrible. They had all these limitations for what you could do. So
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.120]   they wouldn't even enable a lot of different business models, especially the marketplaces
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.120]   or platforms like Shopify or Lyft. And if you tried to get up and running with them
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.600]   quickly, their answer was, "Oh, let me put you through a sales process. Fill out a sales
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.160]   form, have multiple sales calls."
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.680]   And if you think about from the mindset of a lot of people who are builders, they want
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.520]   to move quickly and they don't necessarily need to even have a sales call. They're just
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.040]   ready. They want to see the product. If it works, they want to go test it. And Stripe
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.280]   really built for that. At the time, we used to talk a lot about arming the upstarts and
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.000]   really providing a product that helps support others, founders, and startups, and small
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.680]   business owners do whatever they need to do and not have all of the bureaucracy and all
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.120]   of the white tape.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.400]   And that was something that was, I think, such an important and vital part of Stripe
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.960]   because it made it possible where, yeah, within a week, you can start accepting payments for
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.720]   your product, which is so much of the lifeblood of what proves out a company.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.680]   So for those who are unfamiliar with what Stripe does, what does it do and how does
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.320]   it make money?
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.060]   Stripe started off being one of the first companies that made it really easy for any
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.640]   company in the world to accept credit card payments. Over the course of my time there,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.920]   Stripe really evolved from being a pure credit card payments company to really providing
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.400]   a number of different financial infrastructure products, which also enabled you to move money
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:40.360]   between people or businesses, for you to open up bank accounts, for you to issue credit
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   cards, for you to be able to set up subscription payments, fraud protection.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.200]   So a lot of the core infrastructure, if you're thinking about now moving money, either between
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.220]   people or as a business.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.240]   And that was really something that has unfolded and is the analogy of a lot of times when
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   people talk about AWS, for example, it's just core to a company being able to run.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.920]   So AWS is Amazon Web Services.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.840]   And so I think for those who are familiar with FinTech and startups, Stripe is one of
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.440]   the largest private startups and it's not really a startup anymore.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.300]   It's been around for a long time.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:23.560]   At one point it rose to a almost a hundred billion dollar valuation during the boom in
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.960]   what 2020, 2021.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.880]   And now it's kind of come back to about 50 billion.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.920]   So that's still 10 X when you joined.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:38.720]   So I'm curious, how long did you end up being at Stripe and with so much success with Stripe,
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.320]   why did you decide to leave?
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.320]   Great question.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.200]   So I was there for three years from 2015 through to 2018.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.080]   By the time I was making the decision about, you know, what to do next, the company was
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.760]   about 1,500, 1,600 people.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.040]   It was a tough decision.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:02.360]   I think, you know, I moved to San Francisco for Stripe at a time when also so much of
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.720]   my own social network were people at the company.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.380]   And so it was fairly immersive in terms of, you know, how I spent my time, who I spent
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.960]   my time with.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:18.400]   And they're really good, kindhearted people, very smart, hardworking.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.560]   And I really enjoyed getting to know and building lifelong friendships with a lot of people
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.980]   that I worked with.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.880]   So the decision to leave was actually even harder because of that.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:33.240]   But ultimately for me, I known that, you know, the reason I had been excited to join Stripe
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.640]   at the beginning was because I thought it was a really great environment for me to learn
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.140]   a lot about a lot of different parts of running a company.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.360]   And the things that I would learn the most in at that chapter when they're about 1,500
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.560]   to 1,600 people, and for that to grow to, you know, 3,000 or 5,000, the types of things
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:57.220]   I would learn would be less and less relevant to me actually starting a company one day.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.480]   And so that for me was a really big driver for that was just realizing even though it
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.940]   was a great company doing very well, great environment, what I would be learning would
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.700]   just be less, you know, relevant to what I was actually more excited to do down the road,
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.260]   which was ultimately build my own company.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.260]   Got it.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.260]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.620]   Could you talk about the pay compensation, but you don't have to talk about your specific
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:29.580]   pay compensation, but how much were people getting paid in general for various ranks
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.520]   and how much of that was stock compensation?
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   That's one question.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.320]   And then the second question is when you leave a startup, what is the process like in terms
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.580]   of buying your options or RSUs?
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.620]   Yeah, great question there.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:50.300]   So it's not uncommon for people to over time, especially as the company raises more money,
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:56.460]   has higher valuations for the stock compensation to get to almost as much as, you know, 70,
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.260]   80, 90% of your total compensation.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.620]   That's not true though at the time when it's granted.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:10.040]   And so usually is somewhere in that, you know, 20 to 150% of whatever your salary is in terms
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.940]   of what you might be making from a stock compensation in that first year.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:19.380]   What you're ultimately betting on is for that stock compensation value to grow because the
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.780]   company is doing well.
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:27.260]   And so that's also where there is such, you know, a lopsided nature to how equity compensation
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.260]   works.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.880]   The other thing that's also important is because even though, you know, a company might grow
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:38.260]   from call it 10 billion to a 20 billion valuation, usually the impact for an individual on their
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.740]   equity compensation is actually more than the 2X because there's also going to be a
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:48.460]   buffer built into it, which is at the time when you're granted, your shares, you know,
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.420]   are not considered to be liquid.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.180]   So that actually means that your shares are worth even less than what that last round
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.180]   is.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.020]   So there's actually a lot of upside that usually is more than even just how much the valuation
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.500]   grows up by.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.140]   Can you clarify that a little bit?
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.700]   So let's say I have $100,000 in stock options.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.420]   It's worth $10 billion, it goes to $20 billion.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:15.500]   Are you saying I should think that my $100,000 is worth more than $200,000 or less than $200,000?
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.340]   Usually it would mean that it's more than $200,000 because when your stock options are
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:28.020]   granted and they're valued at $100,000, let's say at a $10 billion valuation, your stock
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.820]   price that the investors paid was $1.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:37.300]   But when you're holding that, actually when you pay for it, you won't be paying $1 because
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.740]   you can't actually sell.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:44.140]   So that's what's called included, you know, the liquidity is taken into account for the
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.140]   value.
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:50.140]   So you as an individual, when you are granted that option, usually you'll be granted at
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.020]   a lower price, which might be, you know, if the investors paid $1, you might be paying
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.020]   $0.50.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.020]   Okay.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.660]   And that's pretty common?
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:04.220]   That's fairly common, fairly industry standard for valuation practices, because as an employee,
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.380]   you actually don't have as much flexibility to be able to sell.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.460]   So because you can't sell, that means, you know, you have a discount.
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.220]   That's also why when companies get closer and closer to an IPO, that discount usually
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.220]   decreases.
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.580]   So, you know, any employee holding stock, it should get closer and closer to whatever
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.860]   the price an investor would pay.
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.860]   Hmm.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:31.420]   For folks listening, I'm sure many folks work at big tech companies or startups, and
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:38.020]   it seems very important for employees to understand what exactly they're getting and at what valuation.
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.980]   Do you have any advice for employees who want to join startups on what they should ask their
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.980]   managers?
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.980]   Absolutely.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:53.220]   So one of the most important things to ask is what the last 409A price is, or said differently,
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.020]   what is the strike price of the options you're granted?
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:02.860]   That is ultimately, you know, what price are you paying in order to buy your shares?
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.180]   And that's something that a lot of times people don't ask.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:10.420]   It's extremely important because that is ultimately, you know, as you think about how much money
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.060]   you have to pay to buy into the company, that's the amount, first off, that you need to pay.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.480]   The other thing that's important is if you ever leave, you usually, the industry standard
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.480]   is that you get some number of months in order to then buy all of your shares.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.020]   And so if, let's say the price is really high, then it might make it even harder for you
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.060]   to leave one day, or it might be a reason why you might stay longer.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.700]   That's not uncommon, you know, for people to end up being in this situation because
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.140]   they didn't ask.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.840]   The other thing, especially given the current landscape of startups, that I would highly
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:50.760]   recommend are for people to really deeply understand what were the prior fundraisers
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.260]   and valuations.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.460]   Because right now we're in this really interesting time with startups where there are still a
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:02.660]   number of startups that raised at valuations one, two, or three years ago that were very
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.660]   high.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:09.540]   Based on what the current multiples are, and multiples in terms of what is the revenue
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:14.980]   times a multiple equals, you know, the valuation of a company, based on what the current multiples
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.700]   are, they're much lower in the market nowadays.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:23.800]   And so if you're someone joining a company and it was valued at $200 million, well, if
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.100]   an investor were to put money in today, they might not think the company is, even after
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.960]   it's grown, worth $200 million.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.820]   And so that's where it really hits people who are joining the company, who might be
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:40.500]   in a situation where they are granted equity that isn't worth actually anything, potentially.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.500]   Right.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.260]   It's just like if you're joining a company, you should put on your analyst hat and analyze
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:54.580]   the company's financials, expected growth, balance sheet, latest fundraising, and so
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.580]   forth.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.580]   Super important.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.900]   That's definitely what I've thought about in the past when I was working.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.760]   And now maybe same thing in the future.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.640]   In terms of leaving Stripe, because I'm assuming that you were paid quite well, did you ever
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.980]   do like a model where you said, well, if I stay at Stripe for 10 years, I'm going to
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:17.500]   earn this base salary and get potentially XYZ stock compensation, and then maybe I'd
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.500]   be set for life.
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.540]   How did you come up with that like financial decision to go leave Stripe and then join
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.260]   your own or start your own company?
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.260]   Great question.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:33.960]   So for me, I definitely did think a lot about the fact that, you know, I would be leaving
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.720]   earlier, I would be leaving potential Stripe stock on the table.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.800]   And ultimately, the thing that I thought about there, and this has actually been a guiding,
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.100]   you know, North Star for me, my whole career was the value of what I can learn will have
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:54.160]   a much bigger impact on my future earning potential than necessarily the dollar that
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.920]   I earn right now.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.220]   That's been an important guiding factor, because actually, you know, when I even took
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.480]   the role in venture, for me, it was a role where I thought I would earn a lot more.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.180]   I actually took a pay cut compared to what I could have earned at other job offers that
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.180]   I had.
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.060]   But I just thought that in a venture environment, I would just learn far more.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:17.540]   Even when I was joining Stripe from a cash salary compensation perspective, it was a
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.820]   cut based on other opportunities that I had at that time.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:26.440]   It was actually, you know, almost 40 to 50 percent lower from a cash compensation perspective.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:32.640]   But I still thought it was worth it, because even, you know, an extra 20 or 40 or 50,000,
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.000]   when I thought about it, I was like, wow, it is a lot.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.960]   But relative to the impact it could have on my future earning potential, it probably won't
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:47.640]   matter as much compared to if this opportunity I could learn, you know, twice as much or
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.720]   I had twice as much exposure to seeing how the best people in the industry do it.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.360]   So for me, that's always been a really important part of framing, especially, I would say,
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.640]   like career growth in your 20s and 30s.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.080]   And so that was actually something that, for me, guided that.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.800]   And ultimately, at Stripe, like, yes, it was a much more known amount in terms of what
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.040]   that option could be if I stayed.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.160]   But I thought I could just learn more and have the chance to do even more things hands
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.520]   on if I end up going to a smaller company.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520]   Right.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.720]   So tell me or tell us about the path after Stripe.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.860]   So I ended up getting pretty lucky where one of the early investors in Stripe had ended
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:37.080]   up introducing me to one of the companies that I ended up going to afterwards.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.080]   I pretty much had had a conversation where I was like, you know, I'm really looking for
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.120]   a much earlier stage team.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.760]   And I really want to go to a company where I feel deeply connected to the mission of
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.720]   what the company is doing.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.040]   Stripe was at a point where they were starting to build for larger enterprises, which is
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.540]   extremely valuable and important.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:00.180]   But for me, I've just always been driven by more of the stories of individual humans and
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.640]   people and families.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.040]   And so I knew I wanted to build a product that was ultimately a consumer product at
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.280]   the end of the day.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.400]   I ended up joining this company named Even right around when they were 30 people initially
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.060]   joining as chief of staff.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.280]   And then I stepped into an acting CEO role there.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.220]   The company was really focused on helping individuals living paycheck to paycheck reach
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.520]   a point of financial stability.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.000]   And I like to joke that I had the best values interview that any startup probably could
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.040]   have had because I ended up actually meeting my life partner and now my co-founder there.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.720]   And we had both joined for the mission.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   Got it.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.640]   And how long were you at Even?
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:48.120]   And how did that, I guess, journey and compensation compare to if you had stayed at Stripe?
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.920]   So for that, because of the role that I was in, I was in a more senior role.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.900]   We ended up selling the company to Walmart and won.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:05.320]   And so from an acquisition and exit perspective, it was, you know, a pretty solid startup exit.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:11.180]   We ended up selling the company into this big entity that is Walmart's new entrance
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.080]   into banking.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.960]   And as I think about, you know, part of this is from an opportunity perspective, part of
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:22.520]   this from a compensation perspective, I think it ended up working out.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.180]   The ultimate part, though, was that the type of experience that I had, because I was effectively
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:33.040]   the CEO's right hand, I ended up being able to further build, you know, the people that
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.760]   I got to know, really get to see firsthand how to operate at an executive level.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.640]   You know, we were there as a company was about 30 people to over 120 people.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.040]   And so the exposure and experience I got was one where I probably wouldn't have gotten
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.280]   an equivalent amount of exposure to kind of being firsthand making the decisions, being
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:57.480]   firsthand in all of the most important meetings as I would have had I stayed at Stripe.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.140]   And so that experience was ultimately the most important thing for me ultimately getting
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.360]   the confidence to be like, oh, I think I'm ready.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.560]   I don't think I actually have another startup that I want to go get more experience at.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:15.200]   I think I've, you know, seen how some companies are built and there's no time like now and
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.720]   now is the right time to build a company like Plenty.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.800]   I mean, that's a great arc because I think joining Stripe in 2015 and then watching it
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.160]   10x or more was kind of a really good move, right?
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.240]   Pretty lucky, pretty auspicious.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.320]   And then joining even at 30 and then selling to Walmart, probably for a multiple of the
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   valuation where you join at was also a good move.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.680]   And so could third time be the charm?
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.360]   Well, it's been two times already.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.320]   So let's talk about Plenty.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:51.600]   When did you all start and how difficult or easy was it to come up with the idea to help
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.080]   modern couples manage their money?
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.600]   And also how difficult or easy was it to raise capital and get other people to believe in
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.600]   the mission?
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:06.040]   So Plenty was started two years ago and it really started out of a lot of frustration
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.200]   that Channing and I had had when we started trying to merge our finances after we got
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.280]   engaged.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.960]   We were trying to answer what felt like fairly straightforward questions like, where should
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.360]   we put our money?
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.280]   How much do we need for a house?
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.680]   What happens if we have two kids or three kids or four kids and what does that look
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.780]   like in terms of what we would need to support that?
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.480]   And the thing that was crazy was we were like, we're not the first ones to ask these questions.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.940]   So many couples have asked these questions, are asking these questions.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.880]   So surely there must be great products and solutions for this.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.320]   The thing that was mind blowing for us was we tried every product and we're like, wait
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.320]   a second.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:49.120]   Almost all of the products that we can see from the last generation of FinTech only really
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.880]   work for you to use on your own.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:56.160]   They have all these, you know, I'm not going to name names here, but there's definitely
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.440]   companies that have joint products where both people can't even deposit.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.160]   You have companies that offer, quote, family plans, but they don't even offer joint accounts
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.400]   and there's no shared visibility.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.080]   So we started seeing all these broken holes where we were like, wait, we know that modern
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:17.020]   couples want to work together a lot more than the tools enable that right now.
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.900]   So that was a really big starting point for us.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.700]   Another starting point too was we started, you know, meeting, we actually found this
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.720]   list of Forbes top 40 financial planners for millennials.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.640]   And we were like, well, let's just see what that's like.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.800]   Maybe that is a good solution for our generation.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.240]   And after interviewing with about 20 of them as a prospective client, we just got fired
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.520]   up because we had people, what it felt like selling a snake oil where we were like, wait,
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.520]   we both come from a background in finance.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.480]   You know, I have my CPA and my CFA Channing has a degree in finance and economics.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.320]   And we were like, you're just throwing buzzwords at us to make it feel like we should trust
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.420]   you and pay you either thousands of dollars, a couple percent.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.580]   You know, we had one person even try to pitch us on three percent of our annual income in
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.760]   order to work with them as a client.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.840]   And this was one of the people on the top list too.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.200]   And we were just shocked that we were like, this can't be the solution for people who
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.800]   are just trying to do the right thing with their money.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.600]   It needs to be a lot more affordable.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.500]   And it also is just a different service offering.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.620]   People I think don't want to talk to humans to the same degree and say that every single
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.800]   question you have, you don't have the ability to answer it on your own.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.580]   You have to talk to a human and email them.
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.520]   And then, by the way, also pay them, you know, five thousand dollars a year.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.520]   Right.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.600]   So that was a really big core for what started, you know, things.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.740]   And then ultimately, one of the things that we also believe in deeply is over the course
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:50.640]   of the next 10 years, we believe that because of the last generation of fintech and especially
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:57.160]   fintech infrastructure, there will be a small number of companies that really challenge
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:03.420]   the Wells Fargo's, the Schwab's, the big banks in the U.S. and are actually able to
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:09.400]   challenge them because they've built a much better product offering that all works together.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.160]   Your taxes are integrated with your investing, which is integrated with how you apply for
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:18.580]   your mortgage, which integrates with how you manage your day to day spending and saving.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:24.160]   And we believe that will be built and aim to make plenty one of those companies.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.160]   Awesome.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:32.320]   So for 2024, let's say second half of 2024, what can plenty provide couples today?
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.880]   And where do you see the roadmap over the next three to five years?
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   Great question.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:44.220]   So right now, couples can come in and have one place where they can see what they have
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.960]   together as well as what they have on their own.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:53.080]   We treat every partnership as a partnership plus two individuals.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:58.260]   And so you have this visibility into not only all the accounts that you have not at plenty,
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.640]   but also your spending, your saving and investing and your income.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.660]   From there, we know that one of the big drivers for couples and one of actually the most positive
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:12.120]   moments of talking about money is really talking about the goals that you share and want to
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.480]   work on together.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:21.000]   So we offer plenty investment accounts so you can easily save or invest towards a home
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.800]   renovation, a home down payment, maybe for your kids to go to college for your retirement.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.280]   And so we will actually help you stand up both investing and saving where our savings
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.480]   product today, you know, interest rates always change, but right now it's the 5.1 percent
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.480]   rate.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.840]   And we also have a more advanced stock portfolio that we put together for you that uses individual
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:47.400]   stocks instead of ETFs in hopes that it ends up actually reducing future taxes that you
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.880]   might pay.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.200]   And very much our mental model for all the investment products that we offer are really
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.280]   looking at what you would get if you worked with a wealth manager.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.880]   But for most everyday families, they don't even know to ask for much less.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.880]   They don't even know that it could be right for them or how to access it.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.160]   So that's a bit of a framework for how we've thought about what products we will have as
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.120]   part of our upcoming launch.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.200]   And then for the rest of this year, we're really excited to bring banking to the forefront
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:20.720]   as well, so you can also offer a plenty checking account as well as a savings account.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.600]   And you will also be able to manage your taxes, too, from Plenty.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.080]   Got it.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.280]   Sounds like a lot is ahead and sounds really good.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:37.320]   In conclusion, can we talk a little bit diving down deep into joining a startup?
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.760]   Because I know a lot of listeners here might also want to move to San Francisco or some
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.680]   big city and join a startup and leave their boring career behind where they're not learning
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.760]   much of anything and they're just doing the same old thing over and over again.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.640]   What are your thoughts about joining a startup at various stages of funding?
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:03.320]   For example, pre-seed, I guess seed series A, B, C, D, and then I guess eventually IPO,
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.800]   which is not a startup.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:12.720]   Yeah, so I would say this with, you know, very much a lot of awareness that I've been
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.360]   incredibly lucky with the companies that I have ended up joining.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.360]   I think also one thing is at every step when I made the decision to join a startup, for
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.560]   me it wasn't just joining any startup or taking any job.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.880]   I talked to a number of different companies and opportunities.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.720]   I really evaluated every startup as if I were an investor who could only make one investment.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.120]   And so I don't think all startup jobs are necessarily equal.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:46.520]   I think it's helpful to have a foot in the door for your initial startup, if especially
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:52.320]   if you're moving from another city where there might not be as much of a startup or tech presence.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:58.520]   But ultimately I would say very early on, it matters a lot if you're at a company that
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.120]   has seen growth.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:05.320]   And so being very analytical, even if it's necessarily, you know, the perfect role, I
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:10.920]   would take not having the perfect role at a startup that is growing quickly any day
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.880]   over "the perfect role" at a company that isn't growing.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.720]   Because what ends up happening is you end up spending a lot of your time and a lot of
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.240]   the experience you gain is not actually solving growth problems.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.560]   And it also is a bit more of like a strange dynamic where at Stripe, it was so collaborative
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   because the company was growing so quickly, where everyone was just trying to help each
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.720]   other because ultimately we were trying to help the company and everything, like we needed
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.360]   all hands on deck.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.960]   And what I've also seen is sometimes when people join companies that don't grow as much
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:47.000]   or aren't growing at all, it ends up actually creating a lot more of pressure where instead
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.560]   of everyone pointing forwards, you end up having a lot more internal politics and a
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.680]   lot more internal dynamics because ultimately it's not solving the problem that, you know,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.680]   the company isn't growing or there's other issues that are bigger with the company.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.800]   So especially if you're earlier on in your career, I'd recommend like say yes to a seat
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   on something that is growing quickly.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:13.720]   I think my original title was like a sales analyst accountant.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.640]   It was like a hodgepodge title, but it was like, I'll take whatever seat and I'll just
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.840]   once I get there, like I'll do whatever we need, which I think is absolutely the mentality
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.760]   that is, you know, helpful and you also learn the most in while you're joining something.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.760]   Got it.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:32.080]   Well, it's been a great journey, Emily, and I wish you best of luck with plenty.
