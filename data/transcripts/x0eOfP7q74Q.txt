[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   I would like to call your attention this evening to the 32nd verse in the 8th chapter of Paul's
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:18.120]   epistle to the Romans. The 32nd verse in the 8th chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:27.640]   He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:36.600]   also freely give us all things? Now I would remind you that here we are considering the
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.000]   second of four challenges that the apostle puts up himself to the doctrine of the final
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.640]   perseverance of the saints that he has taught us in verses 28, 29, and 30. He does this,
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.240]   as I say, in order to strengthen our hold and our grasp upon this most comforting and
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.480]   concerning and encouraging doctrine. Having stated it positively, he puts up then all
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.760]   the possible difficulties and objections, and he deals with them one by one. And the
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.840]   result is that after he has ridiculed them out of existence, we should all be firmly
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.320]   rooted and established in this great doctrine, this final assurance that we shall be brought
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.380]   by the grace and the power of God unto that state in which we shall be made perfectly
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.200]   conformable to the image of God's Son. In other words, that we shall be finally glorified.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.760]   The argument is that if God justifies a man, that man can be sure that he is going to be
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.800]   glorified. Very well, we are now looking at the second
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.200]   objection. The first, of course, was in the 31st verse. If God before us, who can be against
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.400]   us, puts up any possible challenge to the power of God, and shows there's none, then
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.680]   here in this second challenge, he seems to raise the question, is there any possibility
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.720]   that God's love to us can somehow or another become lessened? Because if God doesn't
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.760]   love us, we are undone. If God should ever cease to love us, we are finished. So he raises
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.000]   this question, is it in any way conceivable or possible that God's love to us, as we
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.040]   go on and as we prove to be so slow to learn, so frail, so fallible, and as we may fall
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.600]   into sin, is it possible that God will cease to love us? And so, though he started this
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.120]   great process of salvation in us, he'll abandon it and leave us, and we shall be finally reprobate.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.040]   Now the business of this 32nd verse is to deal with that challenge to this doctrine.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.160]   And this is the answer, "He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.480]   us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?" Now we began considering
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.200]   this last week. We looked at the argument in general, and we saw that it's an argument
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.400]   from the general to the particular, from the greater to the less, if you like. God having
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.600]   done the greatest thing of all, he can't refuse us something which is less than that.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.080]   That's the nature of the argument. And secondly, I emphasize this, because it is of supreme
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.200]   importance that he doesn't base his case upon a general view of the love of God. He
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.440]   bases it upon what God has actually done for us in demonstration of his love, and shows
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.800]   us the significance of what he has done. In other words, we've got facts plus the doctrine
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.280]   that emerges out of these facts. Now that's most important. And then we began to consider
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.840]   the actual argument itself. And the first thing we saw was this, that he emphasizes
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.560]   that what happened on the cross on Calvary's Hill was God's action. The whole case here
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.880]   depends upon what happened on the cross on Calvary's Hill. That's the crown on which
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.960]   we can be sure that God's love will never wane, never become less than it is, or ever
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.520]   abandon us. It's what happened on the cross on Calvary's Hill. What was it? Well the
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.720]   first thing he says is, it was God doing it. He that spared not his own son. Not men, God.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.320]   It's God acting on Calvary. That's the first thing. The second thing was, we emphasize
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.800]   this expression, his own son. We've got to be clear who this person there on that middle
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   cross on Calvary's Hill is. And it's God's own son. It's not a man, not a great religious
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:11.680]   genius, not somebody who achieved divinity. It's God's eternal son. The one who was able
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.680]   to say, "I and the Father are one." The only begotten, the beloved of the Father. Very
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:29.160]   well. Now then, we go on. Point number three. He that spared not his own son. So what was
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.280]   happening there was that in a way that God was not sparing his own son. What does this
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.320]   mean? Well it's very interesting to notice that the Apostle here used a word which is
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.960]   translated as "spared not." It's an old word that is used in connection with the offering
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:56.400]   of Isaac by Abraham in Genesis 22, 16. The Septuagint translators who translated that
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.840]   Old Testament into Greek used this very word there in Genesis 22, 16, the very word that
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.400]   the Apostle uses here. Now the verse reads like this in the Authorized. "By myself have
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:17.680]   I sworn," saith the Lord, "for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:26.440]   thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee." There is no question,
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:36.080]   of course, but the offering of Isaac by Jacob is a type of what God himself did on Calvary's
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:43.360]   Hill. Here's Abraham offering his son, his specially beloved son, Isaac, his only true
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:50.960]   son. He's ready to offer him up at the behest and the demand and the commandment of God,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.560]   "Thine only son." He didn't withhold him. Now that's the very word that the Apostle
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.360]   uses here. He that spared not. He didn't hold anything back from him. That's what
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.480]   it means. And it's the most significant word. The same word is used in Acts 20, 19,
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.040]   where the Apostle prophesies to the elders of the church at Ephesus that certain wolves
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.600]   and so on shall come in, not sparing the flock. Rapacious. And they're going to attack them
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.520]   and maul them. Nothing will be spared. Nothing is going to be held back. Now that's the
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:33.320]   word that's used. And what does it mean? Well what it means, you see, is this. That
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:43.880]   God the Father did not spare his son anything in this world, either in his life, but particularly
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:52.440]   here in his death. He didn't hold back from him anything that was a part of the process
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:08:01.960]   by which he could save us. Everything that was essential to our salvation came upon the
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:09.640]   Son of God. Though he was God's own son, his dearly beloved son, he didn't spare
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:15.680]   him anything. He didn't hold anything back because it was his son. Now you and I tend
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.000]   to do that sort of thing, don't we? We spare people whom we like. We keep things back.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   If we can spare them any amount of suffering, we're always ready to do so. What we are
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.280]   told here is he didn't hold anything back at all. Nothing was kept from him. He didn't
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:38.840]   withhold anything from him at all. But that brings us to the next term, which is the word
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.720]   "but". And I've got to take this word on its own. It's the fourth statement here.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:55.760]   This expresses extreme contrast. God didn't spare him. On the contrary, it was the exact
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:02.560]   opposite. Well now, what is the exact opposite? Well, that's our next word, word five, "delivered
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:11.960]   him up." Delivered him up. Now you notice how the apostle, you see, uses a negative
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.960]   first and then a positive, and puts this strong contrast between them. What for? Well, to
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:23.760]   emphasize. He's emphasizing the thing. Far from sparing his own son anything, he delivered
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:31.400]   him up. On the contrary, it was the other extreme. Far from holding things back from
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:40.520]   him, he delivered him up. This is, of course, a vital part of the apostle's argument here.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.700]   This is the greater which God has done, the greater thing that he's done, from which we
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.240]   are going to deduce that having done that, he can't refuse the lesser. So it's essential
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.360]   that we should understand this "greater". Delivered him up for us all. Now, the apostle
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.720]   has already introduced us to this idea in the last verse of the fourth chapter, where
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:09.280]   he says this, "who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification."
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:16.960]   This is his term. Delivered for our offenses. It's exactly the same thing here. Delivered
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:26.040]   him up for us all. Now what does this mean? Well, of course, we are here face to face
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:34.720]   with the great mystery of the atonement, and what happened to our blessed Lord and Savior
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:41.160]   in order that you and I might be saved. But it is absolutely essential to the apostle's
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:47.400]   argument here that we should understand something of what was involved. And as there is a great
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:53.320]   deal of confusion about this, as there is about most matters connected with our salvation,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:11:01.760]   we must handle it carefully. So much is detracted from this again, as I was indicating last
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:08.720]   Friday night, that we really must examine it closely. Delivered him up. To whom? To
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.920]   what? What does it mean? Well, take that phrase that I read to you in the reading at the beginning
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:21.040]   in Luke 22, verse 53. When these people came to arrest our Lord, he said, "What are you
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.720]   doing?" He said, "I've been with you, I've been with you daily in the temple,
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:32.440]   you didn't lay a hand on me, you did nothing upon me." "But," he says, "this is your
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:42.560]   hour and the power of darkness." Now there's only one meaning to this. He was delivered
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.880]   up as it were to the power of darkness. He says so. This is your hour. I know what's
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:55.240]   happening. This is your hour and the power of darkness. That's the explanation as to
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.080]   why you're doing it now and you didn't do it before. This is the hour which has come
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.360]   that I've got to go through this. It's your hour now, the power of darkness.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:12.760]   There's no doubt about this. The Apostle Paul in Colossians 2, verses 14 and thereabouts,
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.640]   talks about the same thing. The principalities and powers, how our Lord triumphed over them,
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.880]   putting them to an open shame. Yes, but before he triumphed over them, he was in their power
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:33.600]   as it were. You remember how he said again to his own followers how that the evil one
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:42.720]   was coming and findeth nothing, he says, in me. But he knew that he was coming. In other
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:49.360]   words, part of this delivering up means that as it were, he is for the time being in the
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.200]   hands of the powers of darkness. That's a part of it.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.820]   But then to get further light on this, we must remind ourselves of what happened to
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.720]   him in the Garden of Gethsemane. Now there are several accounts of this. You've got
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:11.640]   it in Matthew 26 and you've got that account of it which we read just now from Luke 22.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:19.120]   It doesn't matter which of them you take, but these are the terms that are important.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.400]   He was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down and prayed, saying,
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:30.800]   "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cut from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.360]   thine, be done." Now you remember that he offered that prayer three times. And there
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.840]   appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed more
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:51.160]   earnestly, and his sweat was as it were, great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:14:00.360]   Delivered up, delivered him up for us all. That's something that throws a bit of light
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:07.200]   on it in the same way. And then of course, you have to come to that cry upon the cross,
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:20.000]   "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Matthew 27, 46. There he is on the cross and
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:29.240]   he cries out, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" You've got to take that
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.800]   in to understand what is meant by "delivered him up for us all."
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:42.600]   Then we've got the statement of the Apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 5, 21, "He, God, hath
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:52.860]   made him to be sin for us." Who knew, knows him, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:59.360]   of God in him. He delivered him up for us all. Yes, he made him to be sin for us. Who
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:06.560]   knew, knows him himself, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:15.120]   And then you've got the statement in Galatians 3, 13, which again is most expressive. "Christ
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:23.760]   hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. For it is written,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:32.440]   'Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.'" He was made a curse for us.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:41.840]   And then you've got the expression, of course, in Philippians 2, that he humbled himself,
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:52.040]   even unto death. Yea, even the death of the cross. The humbling, you see. Even, even to
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:16:00.280]   the death of the cross. And finally you've got in Hebrews 12, 2, the statement to the
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:09.400]   effect that he "endured the cross, despising the shame."
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:15.440]   Now all these words which I'm quoting here, I quote in order that we may see something
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:26.040]   of the content of this expression, of his being delivered up for us all. Now, I take
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.640]   the trouble to give you this context in order that we might understand what happened to
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:39.700]   him on the cross. Because it is, as I say, so constantly misunderstood and misinterpreted.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:46.080]   It means, of course, nothing less than this. That he was delivered up by God the Father
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:55.480]   to bear the full wrath of God himself against sin. He was delivered up to bear the full
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:04.960]   penalty of God's holy law upon sin and transgression. That's what he was delivered up to. And nothing
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.640]   was withheld. Now, it's an extraordinary thing how people
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:18.200]   try to detract from this. Only last Saturday morning, after what I'd been saying here
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:25.320]   on the Friday evening, I read in a popular morning newspaper what's called a one-minute
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:31.760]   sermon by a well-known writer. And his text was, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:42.320]   me?" And this is what he said. He said, "The cry from the cross was not in grief or protest.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:49.360]   It echoed the psalmist's prophetic song of thanksgiving, trust, and triumph." Now,
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:55.840]   the popular writer there, of course, was just saying what has often been said by people.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.480]   They seem to have a fear of saying that the cry of our Lord on the cross was a cry of
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.560]   dereliction. They say, "That's impossible, of course. It couldn't have happened to the
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.400]   Lord Jesus Christ. He was the Son of God. He knew everything. He knew he was going to
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:14.000]   triumph. He cannot have meant, therefore, 'Hast thou rarely left me?'" They say,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.240]   "The thing is inconceivable." Well, then you say, "Well, why did he utter the words?"
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:26.360]   Oh, they say, "That's quite simple. They are the opening words of Psalm 22." And Psalm
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:34.000]   22, though it opens with those words, is ultimately a song of triumph. So he says, you see, "It
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:42.080]   echoed the psalmist's prophetic song of thanksgiving, trust, and triumph." So when our Lord cried
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:48.960]   out saying, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" there was no grief. There was
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.760]   no agony. He was simply quoting Psalm 22 as if to say to all the people, "It's all right.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:01.440]   This is happening to me now, but I know that it's all going to lead to triumph." He was
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:08.560]   just quoting Psalm 22 and not in any way giving expression to what he himself was feeling
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:18.060]   at the time. Now, this to me is something which is really quite pathetic, because one
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:23.840]   understands so well the object of people who expound the statement and the cry on the cross
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:30.760]   in that way. But you see, in their anxiety to safeguard the knowledge of our God, of
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.600]   our Lord, they detract from what is perhaps the greatest glory of all of what happened
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:44.120]   on the cross, the thing the Apostle Paul here goes out of his way to emphasize. What you've
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:54.160]   got in Psalm 22 is a wonderful prophetic account of all that our Lord was going to endure upon
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:00.920]   the cross. Read it for yourselves. The thirst, the pain in the body, the consciousness of
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:07.920]   all, the agony in his bones, and so on. It's a most amazing description of death by crucifixion.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:13.520]   Of course it ends, as I say, in a note of triumph, but our Lord also on the cross was
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:21.160]   able to say, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." He was able to say, "It is finished."
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:27.520]   So on the cross you have got the note of triumph and of satisfaction. But you see, the tragedy
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:34.960]   is this, that they're so concerned about this ultimate note of thanksgiving, trust,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:42.560]   and triumph, that they don't recognize that before he came to that, he had to pass through
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:49.720]   this terrible agony and through this moment when he felt utterly abandoned.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:21:02.160]   Now let me establish the point. Our Lord, I say, before he came to the moment of satisfaction
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:08.080]   and of triumph and was able to say, "It is finished," and so on, had first of all
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:15.680]   had to pass through this terrible moment when he was utterly abandoned of his Father, and
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:21.480]   knew it and felt it to the very depths. Now, why am I so concerned about this? Well, my
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:28.040]   real reason is that we must be true to the Scripture. Now we looked at Isaiah 53 last
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:34.840]   week, but let me bring you back again to some of the terms that are used there that insist
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:40.000]   upon what I'm saying. You see, this other exposition tries to make us believe that our
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.320]   Lord was so certain of the ultimate triumph that there was no grief at all in the cry
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.960]   on the cross. He says so specifically, "The cry on the cross was not in grief." He
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:59.240]   does away with the element of grief. It was but this prophetic song of thanksgiving, trust,
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.500]   and triumph. But now listen to Isaiah, who was given this
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:09.980]   preview and who expresses it in such wonderful way, "Surely he hath borne our griefs and
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:21.160]   carried our sorrow." Listen, "The chastisement of our peace was upon him." Then listen
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:30.900]   to these terms, "He was oppressed, he was afflicted." Then there are further terms,
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:38.580]   "Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He hath put him to grief." And yet we are
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.900]   told there was no grief. He was just quoting Psalm 22 and its ultimate triumph. But Isaiah
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:55.980]   tells us, "He hath put him to grief." And then we go on to the phrase about his
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:03.420]   travel of his sorrow. Now you can't dismiss these terms. "He hath borne our griefs,
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:11.780]   carried our sorrow. He was smitten of God and afflicted." Smitten of God, by God,
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:20.780]   and he knew that. And afflicted, wounded, bruised, chastisement, oppressed, afflicted.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:28.380]   "Surely he hath put him to grief." You can't take it out. If you do, you miss the
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:38.780]   central glory of the cross. In other words, we've got to realize this, that our Lord
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:46.940]   experienced there all the torment and the suffering and the agony that results from
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:52.540]   the punishment of sin. Now, let me add further proof. Look at what
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:24:00.860]   happened in the Garden of Gethsemane. Why was our Lord in an agony of sorrow? According
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.620]   to these friends, there was no grief, there was no agony. He knew that he was ultimately
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.980]   going to triumph, that he was going to be raised from the dead. He'd always said
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.860]   that. He'd always told the apostles that he was not only going to be slain, but that
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:20.100]   he was going to be raised again on the third day. He said that repeatedly. Well, in that
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:27.380]   case, what's the meaning of the agony in the Garden? Why did he sweat great drops
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:33.460]   as of blood? Now, you can't take agony out of the Garden of Gethsemane. There was an
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:41.140]   awful soul agony. There was grief to the extent that he was sweating drops of blood. How do
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:47.900]   you explain it? Now, you see, our friends don't explain it. If there was no grief
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.100]   upon the cross, there was obviously none in the Garden, because what was happening in
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.940]   the Garden was that he was just in anticipation, beginning to realize what he was going to
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.300]   experience on the cross. Whatever the agony was in the Garden, it was much greater on
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:09.500]   the cross. There he was looking forward to it, there he was experiencing it. But they
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:14.620]   want to do away with the grief. There's no agony. It's the anticipation of the triumph,
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:23.420]   says this good evangelical writer. But you can't do that. There was real agony in the
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:32.500]   Garden and upon the cross. What is this? What is this thing that our Lord is so concerned
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:39.740]   about that three times he says to his Father, "If it be possible, let this cup pass by."
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:46.100]   And there's only one adequate answer. It wasn't that he was afraid of death. If you
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.060]   say that, you make him smaller than the saints. You make him smaller than many a man who's
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:57.980]   not a Christian at all. No, no, there's only one answer. He knew that there was to
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:06.900]   be a moment when God, having made him to be sin, God having put our sins upon him, God,
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:12.740]   his Father was going to smite him. He was going to strike him. He would avert his face
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:18.340]   from him. And he who had ever looked into the face of his Father and loved him from
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:26.540]   all eternity would be separated from him and would experience the agony and the grief and
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:35.660]   the suffering of any soul under the wrath of God against him. And the idea that our
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:42.060]   Lord didn't experience that, that he knew no grief, it is something, I say, which takes
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:48.860]   out the central glory of what happened on the cross. It vitiates and nullifies the Apostle's
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:54.940]   whole argument here. What the Apostle is saying is this. God delivered him up. He didn't
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:27:00.180]   bear him anything. When he put our sins upon him, though he was his own dearly beloved
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:07.300]   son, he didn't withhold any part of the punishment. He poured it all upon him, everything
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:14.180]   that he deserved. He kept nothing back of it. And the son submitted himself to it willingly
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:23.780]   and readily. That's the statement. He delivered him up for us all. And he poured the vials
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:32.220]   of his wrath upon him. He smote him, he struck him, he wounded him, he bruised him, he afflicted
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:38.740]   him. He's put him to grief with nothing at all being kept back.
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:46.740]   Oh, my friends, how important it is that we should take the Scripture as it tells, and
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:52.260]   not allow our philosophies about the person of the Son or that it was inconceivable that
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:56.380]   the Father in his love should ever do that to his son who was innocent. That's their
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:01.420]   argument, you see. They argue always from the love of God, and they think they understand
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.580]   it, and they think they're making the love of God bigger. Can't you see that they're
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:11.860]   making it very much smaller? The love of God is as great as this, that he did that to his
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:18.900]   son for us. He put him to grief. He smote him. There came this agony, this moment in
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.900]   which he cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" He was forsaken at that
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:29.420]   point. Sin came between him and his father, and he felt utterly forsaken, and he cries
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:34.380]   out in his agony. You see what he experienced on the cross was altogether greater than what
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.700]   he'd experienced in the garden. And there he was in such an agony, sweating blood, and
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:47.180]   he asked, "If it be possible that this God pass by." But it is, as I say, absolutely
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:56.700]   essential to the Apostle's argument here. He delivered him up to all that. He's made
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:06.380]   him to be sin for us. And he experienced to the depth of his soul all that that meant.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:13.060]   He is the Lamb of God being put to death, separated from his father, experiencing it
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:19.660]   to the very depths. Then the next word, the sixth word, is the word "for." What does
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:26.820]   this mean? Delivered him up for us all. Well, it actually means on behalf of. It isn't
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:32.100]   merely that it was done for our benefit. Now I know that the actual word used here by the
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:38.060]   Apostle is not the word that he normally uses when he wants to convey this notion "on
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:42.540]   behalf of." But that's the word he uses elsewhere, and the whole context here makes
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:50.980]   it perfectly plain that that is its real meaning here, that it was done on our behalf. He bare
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:57.420]   our sins in his own body on the tree. God delivered him up instead of all of us. That's
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.740]   what it means, to the punishment. We should be delivered to the punishment for we are
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.420]   the sinners. But instead of delivering us up for the punishment, God delivered him up
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:12.740]   for the punishment in our state and in our place. That's his argument. Then the next
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:20.900]   word, word seven of course, is the word "us." But deliver him up for us. Now we've got
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:30.860]   to give the full content to this word again. For us. What's the truth about us? Is it
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:37.700]   that we are nice, good, godly, God-fearing, holy people? No, no, it's what we were by
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:45.700]   nature, every one of us. The children of wrath, even as others. What we are by our natural
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:52.420]   descent from Adam. What we are as the result of our own actions, our own unworthy deeds.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:31:00.820]   Oh, Paul's already described us to ourselves in the fifth chapter. We were without strength,
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:06.540]   Christ died for the ungodly. God commended his love toward us in that we were, while
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:13.620]   we were yet sinners, we were worse, we were enemies. That's what we were. But you see
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:20.860]   what he says here is this, that God delivered up his own son, kept nothing back, but allowed
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:29.340]   all that should have come upon us, even us, such as we are, guilty, vile rebels, deserving
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:40.780]   nothing but hell. He delivered him, his only son, up to all that for us, even while we
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:49.380]   were enemies and haters of God. He delivered him up for us then. You see the importance
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:55.420]   of every single word in this verse. Put the full content into that "us". You see that's
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:01.100]   his argument, wasn't it? In chapter 5 verse 10, if while we were enemies we were reconciled
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.380]   to God by the death of his son, how much more being reconciled shall we be saved in his
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:12.740]   life? And the content of "us" is when we were enemies. All right, then I must take
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:21.300]   the last word "all". Delivered him up for us all. Who's he referring to? Is he referring
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.980]   to the whole of mankind? Well obviously he isn't. The "us" constitutes the same
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:31.100]   people that he's already been talking of. We know that all things work together for
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:36.620]   good. To whom? To the whole world? Oh no. To them that love God. To them who are the
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:42.660]   called according to his purpose. That's not everybody. And "us all" here is the
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:48.460]   same "us" as you've heard in the previous verses. Nobody else. He delivered him up for
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:59.380]   us all. Now this is the most important point, because what he's emphasizing is this, that
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:08.380]   he was delivered up for us, every one of us. He was delivered up for us as a whole, yes,
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:12.860]   but he was delivered up for every single one of us, us all. Why do I emphasize that? For
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.580]   this reason, that this is where the final perseverance of the saints comes in. That
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:25.500]   if God has delivered up his Son for me in particular in this "us all", he's not
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:33.940]   going to abandon me. So it's important. Every one of this "us", all of us, are covered
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:42.660]   by this action of God which he there undertook on the cross on Calvary's hill. There's
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.780]   just one other word. I feel I must bring it in. The commentators have disagreed about
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:52.260]   this. I don't think there's any hesitation. Listen. He that spared not his own Son, but
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:34:01.780]   delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also? Freely, freely give us
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:07.220]   all things. I believe that the "freely" belongs to the first part of the statement
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:15.380]   as much as it does to the last part. He doesn't only give us freely all things. He gave up
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:22.940]   his Son for us all, freely. Oh, if you want to know anything about the love of God, here
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:30.300]   it is. See, this is the love of God. He did it all freely. There was nothing in us to
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:35.960]   recommend us. He didn't do it in response to our cry or anything else. We were enemies
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:41.580]   and alienated in our minds by wicked works. We were the children of wrath, even as others.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.980]   Why did God do all this? Oh, he did it freely. He did it of his grace. It's in the very
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:53.460]   word that the apostle uses, translated here "freely". It's grace, the freeness of
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:35:00.900]   God's grace. Everything is the result of the grace of God. And so he spared not his
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:07.820]   own Son, but delivered him up for us all, freely, moved by nothing, but his own eternal
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:16.020]   and glorious grace. Now then, my friends, that is the measure
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:23.860]   of God's love. And it is the only measure of God's love. Yes, you take these people
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:30.020]   who think that they safeguard the love of God by denying this substitutionary theory
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:35.980]   of the atonement, who say that our Lord didn't cry out in agony, and who think that the way
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:41.660]   you show the love of God is this, that God says, "Though you've killed my only Son,
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:45.900]   I still love you, I'm still ready to forgive you." They think they've safeguarded the
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.700]   love of God. They've done away with this notion of wrath and God punishing sin and
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.060]   so on. And they think they've therefore made the love of God something bigger. But I do
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.100]   trust it's plain and clear to everybody in this gathering at this moment that what
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:08.100]   they're doing is to detract from the love of God. The love of God is as great as this,
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:15.860]   that he spared his own Son nothing. But the Son, having offered himself as the land of
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:25.260]   God, having given himself up that God might lay our sins upon him and punish them, God
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:31.740]   meted out the full punishment upon him, though he was his own Son. He didn't keep anything
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:38.260]   back. He poured all his wrath upon him. Don't you see how this magnifies the love? Makes
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:47.500]   it infinitely greater? It wasn't that God was just allowing people to kill his Son.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:54.860]   It was God himself who smote his Son, as Abram had been prepared to do. It was God's action
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:37:00.340]   it's the predetermined counsel and foreknowledge of God that brought that death to pass. It's
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:06.380]   the only way to forgive sin. Sin must be punished. The whole Bible teaches that. God is a God
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:10.700]   of righteousness and justice and holiness. He cannot wink at sin. He cannot pretend he
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:16.220]   hasn't seen it. He cannot just say, "I forgive you because I love you." No, no. The whole
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:23.500]   character of God demands a righteous justice and a righteous retribution. And what happened
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:30.420]   upon the cross was that that was meted out. So as Paul has already told us so wonderfully
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:37.300]   in the third chapter, in verses 25 and 26, "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:42.260]   through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:48.380]   are passed through the forbearance of God." To declare, I say at this time, his righteousness,
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:55.300]   that he might be just and at the same time the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:01.660]   Oh, this is where you see the love of God. That he loved us such as we are to such an
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:07.500]   extent that he did all that to his only Son, didn't spare him anything, delivered him
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:14.420]   up to it all, and poured upon him the final dregs of his wrath against sin and evil and
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:24.060]   the guilt involved in it all. Here's the argument. He's done all that for us. Even
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:32.700]   that, for us, that's the emphasis. Spared nothing, delivered him up, for us, such as
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:40.860]   we were when we were enemies. The rest of the argument follows, doesn't it? If God's
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:45.820]   already done that for us, there is nothing that can ever happen to us or that we can
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:50.700]   ever do that can ever separate us from the love of God. But what if I fall into sin,
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:54.420]   says somebody? My friend, you'd fallen into sin much more before, and you were an enemy
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:59.740]   and an alien and a rebel. He'd sent his Son and spared him nothing. Then for you,
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:04.260]   is he going to refuse you now when you should perhaps fall into sin when you're no longer
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:10.980]   an enemy, but just sin as a child? You see, the thing is inconceivable. But it's only
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:16.780]   inconceivable if you give the full content to sparing not and delivering up. If you don't
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:21.340]   do that, you've got no argument at all, and you miss the whole comfort and the consolation
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:26.700]   of it. Now that's his argument. As God has already done that for us, now there's nothing
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:35.060]   greater than that. I say it with reverence. Even the Almighty and the Eternal God can
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:40.660]   never show his love in a greater manner than he did on the cross on Calvary's hill, when
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:48.180]   he delivered up his own Son for us all and kept nothing back. Very well, we can be certain
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:40:00.140]   that as he's done that for us, he will surely with him also freely give us all things. What
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:05.980]   are these all things? Well, they're the same all things as verse 28. We know that all things
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.940]   work together for good to them that love God. You see, he's already said it. He's only proving
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:15.940]   here what he said before. He'll overrule everything, doesn't matter what it is. Everything is going
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:20.900]   to be overruled by God for our benefit. All things are going to be made to work together
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.860]   for good to them that love God, in order that we might come to that final glorification.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:32.340]   And here he repeats it. All things that are necessary to bringing me to the ultimate conformity
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.660]   to the image of God's Son, it'll be done. The God who's done that can't refuse anything
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.580]   less. He can't give up, can't lose interest, can't cease to love me. Whatever I may do
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:50.060]   or say, that guarantees it. If he's done that, he'll do everything else. Surely he
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:41:01.580]   will also with him freely give us all things. All things that are necessary for my perseverance.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:09.100]   Every grace that I can ever need, I shall have it. Whatever my circumstances, wherever
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:14.740]   I am, whatever the trials, troubles, tribulations, whatever my own weakness, frailty, whatever
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:24.220]   my sin, doesn't matter. He who freely did that for me, will with him also freely give
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:29.140]   me all things, so that the apostle is able to write later to the Philippians and say,
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:37.340]   my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory. The whole lot, doesn't
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:45.300]   matter what it is. Or listen to Paul again in 2 Corinthians 9, 8. God is able to make
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:53.380]   all grace abound toward you, that you always having all sufficiency in all things, may
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:42:02.020]   abound unto every good work. Or take it as John Newton put it so well in that hymn we
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:11.620]   were singing just now. This is the argument. His love in time past, and especially his
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:18.140]   love on Calvary's hill, his love in time past forbids me to think. He'll leave me
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:26.100]   at last in trouble to sink. Each sweet Ebenezer I have in review confirms his good pleasure
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:37.700]   to help me right through to the very end, until I am perfect and entire. So he concludes,
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:44.500]   since all that I meet shall work for my good, the bitter is sweet, the medicine food, though
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:54.260]   painful at present, will cease before long, and then, oh how pleasant, the conqueror's
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:05.180]   song. That's the argument. So I feel there's only one thing to say. It's again the words
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:22.500]   of this great apostle. Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift, indescribable gift,
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:33.860]   when he gave up his own son, delivered him up for us all. It's unspeakable. It's indescribable.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:41.260]   Yes, but the special glory of it is this, isn't it? That I can reason from it, that
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:52.660]   I can argue from it. He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all,
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:44:02.860]   how shall he not with him also freely give us all things that we'll ever need, in health,
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:14.140]   in sickness, in pleasure, in pain, in plenty, in penury, whatever the condition. He will
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:23.580]   freely give us all that is necessary to keep us, to hold us, to guide us, to mold us, until
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:33.380]   at last we shall see him as he is, and be made like him, and be with him in the glory
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:40.460]   everlasting. Christian people, do you work out this argument? Are you assured of your
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:46.840]   salvation? Are you assured of your final perseverance? That's what the apostle wants you to see.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:51.620]   If you haven't got this assurance, if you're not certain of your final perseverance, if
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:56.100]   you still believe that you can fall away from grace and go to final perdition, though you're
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.100]   a Christian now, do you know what it means? You've never really understood what happened
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:06.180]   on the cross on Calvary's Hill, and that's the trouble with people who deny this doctrine.
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:10.020]   They think they know about the love of God. That's just what they don't know. It's
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:17.100]   because they've never realized the depth of that love, what God really did there. But
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:24.340]   the moment you realize that, you're bound to come to this inevitable conclusion. He
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:30.620]   that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not surely,
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:38.140]   that's the word that I told you was left out, surely he shall with him also freely
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:50.260]   give us all things. It's guaranteed. If he's foreknown you, he's predestinated you.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:54.820]   And if he's predestinated you, he's called you. If he's called you, he's justified
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:46:00.780]   you. If he's justified you, he's already glorified you. It's all right. His love
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:05.300]   sees the end from the beginning, and he's given you an absolute proof there, so that
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:12.460]   you may enjoy the assurance and the happiness of it all, even while you're in this world
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:22.900]   of sin and woe and evil and shame. Are you working out this mighty logic? Let us pray.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:34.620]   O Lord, our God, we can but come back unto thee and pause in thy presence and utter our
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:47.340]   sense of astonishment and amazement that thou shouldest have delivered him up for us. O
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:56.780]   Lord, receive our praise and the love of our hearts. Help us, we pray thee, by thy Spirit
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:05.980]   to realize this more and more and more, until we shall be utterly certain of it, rejoicing
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:18.060]   in it, relying upon it, and lost in wonder, love, and praise. O God, receive us and our
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:25.940]   unworthy praise in his most blessed name. And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:33.580]   Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:40.780]   and continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:49.340]   earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall be with him in the glory and made conformable
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:55.640]   to his blessed image. Amen.
