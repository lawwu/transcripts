[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   I love to spend money on things that make my life convenient so you can just see people's eyes light
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.480]   up and then I ask them what if you could quadruple your spending on it people get kind of uncomfortable
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.020]   they get stuck they go oh I would eat out at Chipotle four times a week blah blah blah I go
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.700]   are you sure you'd still eat at Chipotle you wouldn't maybe invite somebody out and pay for
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.940]   their bill and they're like oh yeah actually I would love to do that so I start to show them how
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.920]   money can be multi-dimensional it's not just doing more of the same thing the whole point of this is
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.160]   to get people to realize that money is not something you just worry about it's also not
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.460]   something that you try to minimize as much as possible the hyper frugality world loves to look
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.120]   at cost only how much does it cost how much does it cost that cost too much I could get a 20% cheaper
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.580]   I'm like get a life there's more to life than just saving money on three dollar expenses there's also
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.300]   sometimes where you spend a lot of money because you just want to
