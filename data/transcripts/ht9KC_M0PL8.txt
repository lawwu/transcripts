[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   It's Monday, a new week ahead,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.120]   and we have new tasks ahead,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.640]   and new burdens ahead,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.000]   and new mercies ahead.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.120]   And podcast listener Fabian writes in to ask this.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.080]   Dear Pastor John, this phrase,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.120]   "God will never give us more than what we can handle,"
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.040]   is often used when someone is facing life challenges,
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.800]   sufferings, and trials.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800]   Based on the Bible is this phrase,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.480]   that God will never give us more than what we can handle.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.960]   Is it biblically correct?
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.360]   Whether that statement,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.720]   God will never give us more than we can handle,
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.800]   is biblically correct,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.240]   depends on what we mean by we,
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.300]   and handle.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.440]   What does we mean?
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.960]   What does handle mean?
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.520]   Does we,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.080]   nothing we can't handle,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.520]   does we mean God watches us,
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.520]   takes into account our independent possibilities,
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.680]   based on our track record of handling trouble,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.360]   and thus measure out that trouble to us
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.280]   so that it doesn't go beyond what we independently,
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.320]   by our own resources, can handle?
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.960]   Is that what we means?
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.680]   Or does we mean what we can handle
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.680]   if we receive it by faith in divine assistance,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.960]   and that God knows what he himself will give us by grace
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.660]   in enabling us to handle what he gives us,
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.160]   so he's not thinking of we as independent,
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.960]   but we as dependent on the grace
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.680]   that comes with the difficulty?
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.680]   Which of those two does this statement ask about?
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.920]   And handle, what's handle mean?
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.880]   Does handle mean you never collapse under it?
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.760]   Does it mean you never fail in any task?
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.340]   Does it mean you never mess up?
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.760]   Does it mean you never fail to get a B+
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.740]   on every one of life tests?
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.880]   Or does handle mean you never fail
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.220]   so that you never recover or repent,
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.920]   or restore reconciliation,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.920]   and that you are finally lost because you fail?
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.680]   Which does handle mean?
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.480]   So to answer all of that and give my answer to the question,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.720]   let's just look at the key text
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.760]   that I think he probably has in mind.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.720]   1 Corinthians 10, 13, "No temptation or test,"
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.640]   it's the same word in Greek,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   "No test has overtaken you, but what is common to man,
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.080]   "God is faithful, he will not let you be tempted,
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.080]   "tested beyond your ability or beyond what you're able,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.080]   "but with the temptation,
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.480]   "he will also provide the way of escape
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.060]   "that you may be able to endure it."
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.140]   When Paul says he won't give what's beyond what you're able,
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.560]   he means not beyond what you're able with God's help.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.420]   We know that because of a couple other things he says.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.160]   For example, in 2 Corinthians 9, 8, he says,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.940]   "God is able to make all grace abound to you
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.940]   "so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.940]   "you may abound in every good work."
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.180]   In other words, in every test or temptation,
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.780]   the question is, will I do what I ought to do?
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.760]   And Paul says, "There will be grace."
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.160]   Not just, I'm dependent on you to use your resources
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.520]   without depending on grace.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.620]   I'm giving you grace so there will be grace to do it.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.240]   Not you independent of my powers to help.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.500]   And he said, in 1 Corinthians 15, 10,
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.980]   "By the grace of God, I am what I am,
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.800]   "and his grace towards me was not in vain.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.540]   "On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them,
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.280]   "though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me."
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.040]   In other words, if I survive any test
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.680]   or accomplish any work when I'm tested,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   it is grace, decisively grace, not decisively me.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.920]   So my answer to the first query is,
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.180]   what does we mean in this statement?
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.840]   God will never give us more than we can handle.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.840]   Is that we means we helped by sovereign grace,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.520]   not we independent of the power of God's help.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.240]   And then the question is, what does handle mean?
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.480]   Never stumble, never fail, never get a C-
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.880]   or an F on a particular test that God gives?
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.760]   And my answer is, no, it doesn't mean that.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   If we had perfect reliance on all that he is for us
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.700]   in Christ, we would pass every test glowingly,
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.500]   but God does not promise that kind of perfect reliance
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.400]   on his omnipotent grace.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.640]   Well then, what is being promised when he says
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.400]   that we will always have with every test an escape,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   and when he says that we will have grace for every good work?
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.720]   And I think what is promised is ultimately
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   that he will never let us so stumble or so fail
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.080]   that we don't recover and repent and are restored.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.200]   In other words, he will never let us sin our way
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.280]   into apostasy and damnation.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   He will enable us to bear the fruits of genuine faith
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.120]   and perseverance to the end.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.040]   And here are the texts that make me think that.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.800]   He who began a good work in you will bring it
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.120]   to completion at the day of Christ, Philippians 1:6,
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.920]   Romans 8:30, those whom he predestined he called,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.400]   those whom he called he justified,
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.280]   and those whom he justified he glorified.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.840]   He's gonna keep you.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.600]   Or Luke 22, 31, Simon, Simon, Jesus says to Peter,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.180]   "Behold, Satan demanded to have you
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.160]   "that he might sift you like wheat."
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.980]   Get your faith out of you.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.760]   "But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.040]   "And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers."
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.080]   I prayed for you.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.920]   Yes, you're gonna deny me tonight,
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.640]   but I'm bringing you back.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.200]   You're gonna get an F on this test tonight,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.200]   and I'm gonna make you pass your life test.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.840]   Or 1 Peter 1, 5, "By God's power,
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.240]   "we are being guarded through faith for our salvation."
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.900]   God's power is guarding me.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.360]   He won't let me fail in any test utterly.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.020]   And last one, 1 Corinthians 1, 8,
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.160]   "He will sustain you to the end,
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.980]   "guiltless in the day of Christ."
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.580]   So, conclusion.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.260]   Is the statement, "God will never give us more
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.340]   "than we can handle," biblically correct?
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.620]   Yes.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.620]   If we mean God will never give his people trials
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.520]   in which he will not sustain them
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.020]   and bring them through to everlasting glory,
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.020]   we will be enabled to do all we must do to get there.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.520]   Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.400]   And thank you, Fabian, for the excellent question.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.960]   Tomorrow's question is a good one, too.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.800]   It's about that text in 1 Thessalonians 4, 11
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.880]   that encourages Christians to aspire to live a quiet life
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.220]   and to mind our own business.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.120]   So, should Christians live quietly,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.920]   or should we spark revolutions?
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.400]   That's the question on the table tomorrow.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.240]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.140]   We'll see you then.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.300]   (upbeat music)
