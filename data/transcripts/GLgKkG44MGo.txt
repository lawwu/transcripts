[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.640]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.620]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.220]   Today, my guest is Dr. Jack Feldman.
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.520]   Dr. Jack Feldman is a distinguished professor of neurobiology
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.280]   at the University of California, Los Angeles.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.360]   He is known for his pioneering work
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.800]   on the neuroscience of breathing.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.400]   We are all familiar with breathing
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.920]   and how essential breathing is to life.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.460]   We require oxygen, and it is only by breathing
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.760]   that we can bring oxygen to all the cells
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.400]   of our brain and body.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.220]   However, as the work from Dr. Feldman and colleagues
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.920]   tells us, breathing is also fundamental
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.760]   to organ health and function
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.160]   at an enormous number of other levels.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.680]   In fact, how we breathe, including how often we breathe,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.700]   the depth of our breathing,
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.260]   and the ratio of inhales to exhales
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.560]   actually predicts how focused we are,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.640]   how easily we get into sleep,
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.920]   how easily we can exit from sleep.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.160]   Dr. Feldman gets credit for the discovery
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.760]   of the two major brain centers
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.320]   that control the different patterns of breathing.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.080]   Today, you'll learn about those brain centers
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.840]   and the patterns of breathing they control
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.760]   and how those different patterns of breathing
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.720]   influence all aspects of your mental and physical life.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.880]   What's especially wonderful about Dr. Feldman and his work
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.320]   is that it not only points to the critical role
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.640]   of respiration in disease, in health, and in daily life,
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.960]   but he's also a practitioner.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.640]   He understands how to leverage particular aspects
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.120]   of the breathing process in order to bias the brain
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.320]   to be in particular states that can benefit us all.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.480]   Whether or not you are a person
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.120]   who already practices breath work,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.160]   or whether or not you're somebody
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160]   who simply breathes to stay alive,
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.040]   by the end of today's discussion,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.400]   you're going to understand a tremendous amount
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.360]   about how the breathing system works
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.600]   and how you can leverage that breathing system
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.640]   toward particular goals in your life.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.000]   Dr. Feldman shares with us
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.160]   his own particular breathing protocols that he uses,
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.800]   and he suggests different avenues for exploring respiration
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.720]   in ways that can allow you, for instance,
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.360]   to be more focused for work,
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.040]   to disengage from work in high stress endeavors,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.400]   to calm down quickly.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.780]   And indeed, he explains not only how to do that,
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.360]   but all the underlying science in ways that will allow you
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.600]   to customize your own protocols for your needs.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.040]   All the guests that we bring on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.800]   are considered at the very top of their fields.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.760]   Today's guest, Dr. Feldman,
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.360]   is not only at the top of his field, he founded the field.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.060]   Prior to his coming into neuroscience
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.400]   from the field of physics,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.880]   there really wasn't much information
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.480]   about how the brain controls breathing.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.120]   There was a little bit of information,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.800]   but we can really credit Dr. Feldman and his laboratory
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.080]   for identifying the particular brain areas
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.920]   that control different patterns of breathing
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.400]   and how that information can be leveraged
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.060]   towards health, high performance, and for combating disease.
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.360]   So today's conversation,
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.400]   you're going to learn a tremendous amount
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.580]   from the top researcher in this field.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.420]   It's a really wonderful and special opportunity
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.580]   to be able to share his knowledge with you.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.800]   And I know that you're not only going to enjoy it,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.180]   but you are going to learn a tremendous amount.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.600]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.320]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.200]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.680]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.200]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.160]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.980]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.240]   Our first sponsor is Thesis.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.840]   Thesis is a company that makes nootropics.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.200]   Now I've talked before on the podcast and elsewhere
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.480]   about the fact that I don't really like the term nootropics,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.200]   which means smart drugs,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.360]   because smart means many different things
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.660]   in many different contexts.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.480]   You've got creativity, you've got focus,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.060]   you've got task switching.
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.700]   So the idea that there will be one pill or one formula
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.460]   that could make us smarter and better
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.560]   at all those things at once just doesn't stand up to logic.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.320]   In fact, different chemicals and different brain systems
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.680]   underlie our ability to be creative
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.560]   or our ability to task switch or to be focused.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.460]   And that's the basis of Thesis.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.840]   Thesis is a company that makes targeted nootropics
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.880]   for specific outcomes.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.800]   In other words, specific nootropics to get your brain
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.480]   into states that are ideal
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.720]   for what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.800]   Thesis uses very high quality ingredients,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.900]   many of which I've talked about before on the podcast,
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.360]   such as DHA, ginkgo biloba, and phosphatidyl steering.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.960]   I talked about those in the ADHD podcast.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.920]   Those are some of the ingredients
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.800]   in their so-called logic formula.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.640]   There's a lot of research showing that ginkgo biloba
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.400]   can be very helpful for increasing levels of focus
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.520]   and even for people with ADHD.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.920]   However, I can't take it.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.860]   When I take it, I get really bad headaches.
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.240]   And I know some people who do
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.040]   and some people who don't get headaches
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.320]   when they take ginkgo biloba.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.080]   This is a great example of why nootropics
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.440]   need to be personalized to the individual.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.640]   Thesis gives you the ability to try different blends
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.680]   over the course of a month
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.080]   and discover which nootropic formulas work best
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.680]   for your unique brain chemistry and genetics
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.700]   and which ones are best for particular circumstances.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.660]   So they have a formulation, for instance,
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.200]   which is motivation.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.320]   They have another formulation, which is clarity.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.120]   They've got another formulation, which is logic.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.800]   And each of these is formulated specifically to you
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.120]   and formulated to a specific endpoint
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.320]   or goal state of mind for your particular work.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.880]   So as a consequence, the formulations that you arrive at
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.800]   will have a very high probability
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.980]   of giving you the results that you want.
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.000]   In addition to that detailed level of personalization,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.140]   thesis takes a step further by offering free consultations
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.760]   with a brain coach to help you optimize your experience
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.160]   and dial in your favorite and best formulas.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.280]   I've been using thesis for close to six months now,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.120]   and I can confidently say that their nootropics
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.060]   have been a total game changer for me.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.660]   My favorite of the formulations is their motivation formula
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.160]   that they've tailored to me.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.760]   When I use that formula, I have very clear state of mind.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.440]   I have even energy and I use that early in the day
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.420]   until the early afternoon to get the bulk
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.440]   of my most important work done.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.840]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.000]   you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.080]   take a three minute quiz,
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   and thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.640]   to try in your first month.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.440]   That's takethesis.com/huberman

[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.440]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.880]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.120]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.520]   I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.080]   and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.760]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.600]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.680]   is that it covers all of my vitamin mineral
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.920]   and probiotic foundational needs.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.720]   There's now a wealth of data showing
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.760]   that not only do we need vitamins and minerals,
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.460]   but we also need to have a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.140]   The gut microbiome is a set of nerve connections
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.120]   that link the microbiota, literally,
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.760]   micro bacteria that live in our guts
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.400]   and that are healthy for us with our brain function.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.040]   And our brain is also talking to our gut
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.200]   in a bidirectional way.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.660]   And that conversation is vital for metabolism,
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.160]   for the endocrine system, meaning the hormonal system,
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.660]   and for overall mood and cognition.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.560]   There's just so much data now pointing to the fact
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.660]   that we need a healthy gut microbiome
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.400]   and a healthy brain gut axis, as it's called.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.500]   By taking Athletic Greens once or twice a day,
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.840]   I can get the vitamins, the minerals,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.960]   and the probiotics needed for all those systems
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.200]   to function optimally.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.600]   And again, it tastes great.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   It's great for me.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.080]   In fact, if people ask me what's the one supplement
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.160]   that I should take, and they can only take one supplement,
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.200]   I recommend Athletic Greens for all the reasons I mentioned.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.500]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.120]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.200]   to claim a special offer.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.240]   They're giving you five free travel packs,
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.280]   which are these little travel packs
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.880]   that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.920]   while you're on the road or in the car or on the plane,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.480]   et cetera, and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.960]   There is also a wealth of evidence showing
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.760]   that vitamin D3 is vital to our overall health,
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.280]   and K2 is important for cardiovascular health
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.740]   and other systems as well.
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.360]   Most of us are not getting enough vitamin D3 or K2,
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.360]   even if we're getting some sunshine.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.800]   So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.160]   you get the five free travel packs,
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.000]   a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.180]   athleticgreens.com/huberman is where you go
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.880]   to claim that special offer.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.680]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.240]   Headspace is a meditation app
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.560]   that's supported by 25 published studies
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.280]   and benefits from over 600,000 five-star reviews.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.800]   I've long been a believer in meditating.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.880]   There's so much data now pointing to the fact
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.120]   that regular meditation leads to reduced stress levels,
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.860]   heightened levels of focus, better task switching,
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.580]   and cognitive ability.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.660]   It just goes on and on.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.840]   I mean, there are literally thousands
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.400]   of peer-reviewed studies now in quality journals
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.740]   pointing to the benefits
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.160]   of having a regular meditation practice.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.020]   The problem with meditation is many people,
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.680]   including myself, have struggled
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.580]   with sticking to that practice.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.360]   With Headspace, it makes it very easy
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.400]   to start and continue a meditation protocol.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.160]   The reason for that is they have meditations
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.920]   that are of different lengths and different styles,
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.780]   so you don't get bored of meditation.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.480]   And even if you just have five minutes,
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.860]   there are five-minute meditations.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.040]   If you've got 20 minutes, which would be even better,
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.960]   there are 20-minute meditations.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.560]   Ever since I started using Headspace,
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.340]   I've been consistent about my meditation.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.260]   I do meditation anywhere from five to seven times a week
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.640]   in my best weeks, and sometimes that's drops to three.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.880]   And then I find with Headspace,
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.000]   I can quickly get back to doing meditation every day
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.640]   because of the huge variety
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.520]   of great meditations that they have.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.660]   If you want to try Headspace,
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.240]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.680]   And if you do that, you can get a free one-month trial
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.780]   with Headspace's full library of meditations
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.080]   for every situation.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.980]   That's the best deal offered by Headspace right now.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.480]   So again, if you're interested,
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.280]   go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.520]   One quick mention before we dive
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.680]   into the conversation with Dr. Feldman.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.840]   During today's episode,
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.840]   we discuss a lot of breathwork practices.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.040]   And by the end of the episode,
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.000]   all of those will be accessible to you.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.520]   However, I'm aware that there are a number
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.800]   of people out there that want to go even further
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.400]   into the science and practical tools of breathwork.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.200]   And for that reason, I want to mention a resource to you.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.040]   There is a cost associated with this resource,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.300]   but it's a terrific platform
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.960]   for learning about breathwork practices
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.240]   and for building a number of different routines
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.160]   that you can do or that you could teach.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.780]   It's called Our Breathwork Collective.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.000]   I'm not associated with the Breathwork Collective,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.360]   but Dr. Feldman is an advisor to the group
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.140]   and they offer daily live guided breathing sessions
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.120]   and an on-demand library that you can practice anytime,
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.700]   free workshops on breathwork.
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.880]   And these are really developed by experts in the field,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.540]   including Dr. Feldman.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.720]   So as I mentioned, I'm not on their advisory board,
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.220]   but I do know them in their work
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.980]   and it is of the utmost quality.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.040]   So anyone wanting to learn or teach breathwork
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.120]   could really benefit from this course, I believe.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.000]   If you'd like to learn more,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.820]   you can click on the link in the show notes
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.800]   or visit ourbreathcollective.com/huberman

[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.780]   And if you do that,
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.840]   they'll offer you $10 off the first month.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.660]   Again, it's ourbreathcollective.com/huberman
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.920]   to access the Our Breath Collective.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.840]   And now for my conversation with Dr. Jack Feldman.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.080]   Thanks for joining me today.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.820]   - It's a pleasure to be here, Andrew.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.380]   - Yeah, it's been a long time coming.
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.840]   You're my go-to source for all things respiration.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.040]   I mean, I breathe on my own,
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.580]   but when I want to understand how I breathe
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.160]   and how the brain and breathing interact,
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.640]   you're the person I call.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.580]   - Well, I'll do my best.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.720]   As you know, there's a lot that we don't understand,
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.080]   which still keeps me employed and engaged,
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.600]   but we do know a lot.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.200]   - Why don't we start off by just talking about
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.320]   what's involved in generating breath?
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.320]   And if you would,
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.020]   could you comment on some of the mechanisms
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.560]   for rhythmic breathing versus non-rhythmic breathing?
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.920]   - Okay, so on the mechanical side,
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.560]   which is obvious to everyone,
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.880]   we want to have air flow in, inhale,
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.720]   and we need to have air flow out.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.960]   And the reason we'd need to do this
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.340]   is because for body metabolism, we need oxygen.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.080]   And when oxygen is utilized
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.680]   through the aerobic metabolic process,
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.100]   we produce carbon dioxide.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.280]   And so we have to get rid of the carbon dioxide
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.820]   that we produce, in particular because the carbon dioxide
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.440]   affects the acid-base balance of the blood, the pH.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.260]   And all living cells are very sensitive
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.600]   to what the pH value is.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.120]   So your body is very interested in regulating that pH.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.520]   So we have to have enough oxygen for our normal metabolism,
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.420]   and we have to get rid of the CO2 that we produce.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.160]   So how do we generate this air flow?
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.240]   Well, the air comes into the lungs.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.880]   We have to expand the lungs.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.840]   And as the lungs expand,
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.960]   basically it's like a balloon that you would pull apart.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.700]   The pressure inside that balloon drops,
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.220]   and air will flow into the balloon.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.220]   So we put pressure on the lung to pull it apart,
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.820]   that lowers the pressure in the air sacs called alveoli,
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.180]   and air will flow in because pressure outside the body
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.140]   is higher than pressure inside the body
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.400]   when you're doing this expansion, when you're inhaling.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.700]   What produces that?
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.820]   Well, the principal muscle is the diaphragm,
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.300]   which is sitting inside the body just below the lung.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.540]   And when you want to inhale,
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.060]   you basically contract the diaphragm, and it pulls it down.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.700]   And as it pulls it down,
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.620]   it's inserting pressure forces on the lung.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.340]   The lung wants to expand.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:06.140]   At the same time, the rib cage is gonna rotate up and out,
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.000]   and therefore expanding the cavity, the thoracic cavity.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.620]   At the end of inspiration,
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.100]   under normal conditions when you're at rest,
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.220]   you just relax, and it's like pulling on a spring.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.740]   You pull down a spring, and you let go, and it relaxes.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.840]   So you inhale, and you exhale.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.820]   Inhale, relax, and exhale.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.620]   - So the exhale is passive?
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.220]   - At rest, it's passive.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.580]   We'll get into what happens when you need to increase
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.720]   the amount of air you're bringing in
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.780]   because your ventilation,
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.420]   your metabolism goes up like during exercise.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.340]   Now, the muscles themselves,
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.180]   the skeletal muscles don't do anything unless
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.520]   the nervous system tells them to do something.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.540]   And when the nervous system tells them to do something,
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.940]   they contract.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.700]   So there are specialized neurons in the spinal cord,
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.180]   and then above the spinal cord,
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.000]   the region called the brain stem,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.140]   which go to respiratory muscles,
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.660]   in particular for inspiration, the diaphragm,
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.980]   and the external intercostal muscles in the rib cage,
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.460]   and they contract.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.740]   So these respiratory muscles,
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.420]   these inspiratory muscles become active.
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.700]   And they become active for a period of time,
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.380]   then they become silent, and when they become silent,
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.020]   the muscles then relax back to their original resting level.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.560]   Where does that activity in these neurons
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.860]   that innervate the muscle, which are called motor neurons,
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.840]   where does that originate?
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.760]   Well, this was a question that's been bandied around
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.820]   for thousands of years.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.740]   And when I was a beginning assistant professor,
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.560]   it was fairly high priority for me
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.840]   to try and figure that out because I wanted to understand
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.920]   where this rhythm of breathing was coming from,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.280]   and you couldn't know where it was coming from
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.080]   until you knew where it was coming from.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.660]   And I didn't phrase that properly.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.920]   You couldn't understand how it was being done
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.780]   until you know where to look.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.040]   So we did a lot of experiments, which I can go into detail,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   and finally found there was a region in the brainstem,
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.020]   that's once again this region sort of above the spinal cord,
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.300]   which was critical for generating this rhythm.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.340]   It's called the pre-Butzinger complex,
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.340]   and we can talk about how that was named.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.940]   This small site, which contains in humans
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.260]   a few thousand neurons, it's located on either side,
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.160]   and it works in tandem.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.160]   And every breath begins with neurons in this region
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.560]   beginning to be active.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.540]   And those neurons then connect ultimately
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.560]   to these motor neurons going to the diaphragm
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.780]   and to the external intercostals,
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.960]   causing them to be active
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.600]   and causing this inspiratory effort.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.980]   When the neurons in the pre-Butzinger complex
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.680]   finish their burst of activity,
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.680]   then inspiration stops, and then you begin to exhale
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.980]   because of this passive recall of the lung and rib cage.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.400]   - Could I just briefly interrupt you
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.160]   to ask a few quick questions before we move forward
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.740]   in this very informative answer?
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.740]   The two questions are, is there anything known
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.340]   about the activation of the diaphragm
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.820]   and the intercostal muscles between the ribs
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.220]   as it relates to nose versus mouth breathing?
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.700]   Or are they activated in the equivalent way,
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.400]   regardless of whether or not someone is breathing
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.780]   through their nose or mouth?
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.880]   - I don't think we fully have the answer to that.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.140]   Clearly, there are differences
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.700]   between nasal and mouth breathing.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.780]   At rest, the tendency is to do nasal breathing
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.460]   because the air flows that are necessary
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.140]   for normal breathing are easily managed
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.660]   by passing through the nasal cavities.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.420]   However, when your ventilation needs to increase,
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.340]   like during exercise, you need to move more air,
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.040]   you do that through your mouth
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.740]   because the airways are much larger then,
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.900]   and therefore you can move much more air.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.620]   But at the level of the intercostals and the diaphragm,
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.620]   their contraction is almost agnostic
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.380]   to whether or not the nose and mouth are open.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.140]   - Okay, so if I understand correctly,
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.420]   there's no reason to suspect that there are particular,
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.660]   perhaps even non-overlapping sets of neurons
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.580]   in pre-Butzinger area of the brainstem
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.960]   that trigger nasal versus mouth inhales?
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:59.500]   - No, I would say that it's not
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.940]   that the pre-Butzinger complex is not concerned
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.780]   and cannot influence that,
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.500]   but it does not appear as if there's any
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.420]   modulation of whether or not it's,
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.800]   where the air is coming from,
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.880]   whether it's coming through your nasal passages
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.500]   or through your mouth.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.920]   - Thank you, and then the other question I have
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.360]   is that these intercostal muscles between the ribs
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.860]   that move the ribs up and out, if I understand correctly,
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.540]   and the diaphragm, are those skeletal,
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.740]   or as the Brits would say, skeletal muscles,
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.220]   or smooth muscles?
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.300]   What type of muscle are we talking about here?
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.740]   - As I said earlier, these are skeletal,
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.160]   I didn't say they were skeletal muscles,
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.100]   but they're muscles that need neural input
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.340]   in order to move.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.700]   You talked about smooth muscles.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.380]   They're specialized muscles like we have in the gut
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.740]   and in the heart, and these are muscles that are capable
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.420]   of actually contracting and relaxing on their own.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.980]   So the heart beats.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.700]   It doesn't need neural input in order to beat.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.160]   The neural inputs modulate the strength of it
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.080]   and the frequency, but they beat on their own.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.060]   The skeletal muscles involved in breathing
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.460]   need neural input.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.920]   Now, there are smooth muscles that have an influence
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.500]   on breathing, and these are muscles that are lining
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.500]   the airways, and so the airways have smooth muscle,
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.500]   and when they become activated, the smooth muscle
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.500]   can contract or relax, and when they contract inappropriately
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.780]   is when you have problems breathing like in asthma.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.100]   Asthma is a condition where you get inappropriate
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.880]   constriction of the smooth muscles of the airways.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.660]   - So there's no reason to think that in asthma,
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.500]   that the pre-bot singer or these other neuronal centers
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.820]   in the brain that activate breathing,
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.500]   that they are involved or causal for things like asthma?
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.500]   - As of now, I would say the preponderance of evidence
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.180]   is that it's not involved, but we've not really
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.680]   fully investigated that.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.520]   - Thank you.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.140]   Sorry to break your flow, but I was terribly interested
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.260]   in knowing answers to those questions,
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.060]   and you provided them, so thank you.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.740]   - Now, remind me again where I was in my--
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.220]   - We were just landing in pre-bot singer,
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.460]   and we will return to the naming of pre-bot singer
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.340]   'cause it's a wonderful and important story, really,
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.540]   that I think people should be aware of.
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:27.180]   But yeah, maybe you could march us through the brain centers
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.740]   that you've discovered and others have worked on as well
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.520]   that control breathing, pre-bot singer
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.700]   as well as related structures.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.500]   - So when we discovered the pre-bot singer,
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.820]   we thought that it was the primary source
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.780]   of all rhythmic respiratory movements,
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.120]   both inspiration and expiration.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.860]   The notion of a single source is like day or night.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.940]   It's like they're all coming, they all have the same origin
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.600]   that the Earth rotates and day follows night.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.860]   And we thought that the pre-bot singer complex
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.860]   would be inhalation, exhalation.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:10.020]   And then in a series of experiments we did
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.280]   in the early part of 2000, we discovered
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.180]   that there seemed to be another region
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.420]   which was dominant in producing expiratory movements,
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.980]   that is the exhalation.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:28.580]   We had made a fundamental mistake
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.620]   with the discovery of the pre-bot singer
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.180]   not taking into account that at rest
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.480]   expiratory muscle activity or exhalation is passive.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.600]   So if that's the case, a group of neurons
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.720]   that might generate active expiration,
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.040]   that is to contract the expiratory muscles
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.280]   like the abdominal muscles or the internal intercostals
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.820]   are just silent.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.800]   We just thought it wasn't there, it was coming
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.480]   from one place.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.760]   But we got evidence that in fact it may have been coming
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.180]   from another place.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.880]   And following up on these experiments,
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.400]   we discovered that there was a second oscillator
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.440]   and that oscillator is involved in generating
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.880]   what we call active expiration.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.560]   That is this active.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.760]   - Like if I go shh.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.120]   - Yeah, or when you begin to exercise,
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.220]   you have to go, and actually move that air out.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.860]   This group of cells, which is silent at rest,
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.120]   suddenly becomes active to drive those muscles.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.320]   And it appears that it's an independent oscillator.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.520]   - Maybe you could just clarify for people
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.080]   what an oscillator is.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.200]   - Okay, an oscillator is something that goes
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.560]   in a cycle.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.760]   So you can have a pendulum as an oscillator
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.200]   going back and forth.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.680]   The earth is an oscillator because it goes around
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.760]   and it's day and night.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.640]   - Some people's moods are oscillating.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.480]   - Oscillating.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.240]   And it depends how regular they are.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   You can have oscillators that are highly regular
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.400]   that are in a watch, or you can have those
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.240]   that are sporadic or episodic.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.100]   Breathing is one of those oscillators that for life
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.720]   has to be working continuously, 24/7.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.320]   It starts late in the third trimester
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.840]   because it has to be working when you're born,
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.240]   and basically works throughout life.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.320]   And if it stops, if there's no intervention
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.800]   beyond a few minutes, it will likely be fatal.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.480]   - What is this second oscillator called?
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.480]   - Well, we found it in a region around the facial nucleus.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:40.360]   So we initially, when this region was initially identified,
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.440]   we thought it was involved in sensing carbon dioxide.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.000]   It was what we call a central chemoreceptor.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.600]   That is, we wanna keep carbon dioxide levels,
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.960]   particularly in the brain, at a relatively stable level
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.400]   'cause the brain is extraordinarily sensitive
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.240]   to changes in pH.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.520]   If there's a big shift in carbon dioxide,
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.480]   there'd be a big shift in brain pH,
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.240]   and that'll throw your brain, if I can use
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.840]   the technical term, out of whack.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.000]   And so you wanna regulate that.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.760]   The way to regulate something in the brain
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.800]   is you have a sensor in the brain.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.440]   And others basically identified that the ventral surface
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.760]   of the brainstem, that is the part of the brainstem
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.520]   that's on this side, was critical for that.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.520]   And then we identified a structure
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.200]   that was near the trapezoid nucleus.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.240]   It was not named in any of these neuroanatomical atlases.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.480]   So we just picked the name out of the hat
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.520]   and we called it the retrotrapezoid nucleus.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.600]   - I should clarify for people,
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.320]   when Jack is saying trapezoid,
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.640]   it doesn't mean the trapezoid muscles.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.960]   Trapezoid refers to the shape of this nucleus,
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.240]   this cluster of neurons.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.800]   Para-facial makes me think that this general area
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.600]   is involved in something related to mouth or face.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.280]   Is it an area rich with neurons
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.080]   controlling other parts of the face?
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.920]   Eye blinks, nose twitches, lip curls, lip smacks?
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.360]   - If you go back in an evolutionary sense,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.760]   and a lot of things that are hard to figure out
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.600]   begin to make sense when you look at the evolution
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.240]   of the nervous system.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.080]   When control of facial muscles going back
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.320]   to more primitive creatures,
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   because they had to take things in their mouth for eating.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.720]   So we call that the face sort of developed.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.960]   The eyes were there, the mouth is there.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.920]   These nuclei that contained the motor neurons,
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.320]   a lot of the control systems for them
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.080]   developed in the immediate vicinity.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.880]   So if you think about the face,
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.080]   there's a lot of subnuclei around there
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.640]   that had various roles at various different times
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.840]   in evolution.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.480]   And at one point in evolution,
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.320]   the facial muscles were probably very important
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.440]   in moving fluid in and out of the mouth
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.920]   and moving air in and out of the mouth.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.560]   And so part of these many different subnuclei
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.760]   now seems to be in mammals to be involved
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.200]   in the control of expiratory muscles.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.000]   But we have to remember that mammals are very special
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.200]   when it comes to breathing,
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.480]   because we're the only class of vertebrates
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.440]   that have a diaphragm.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.480]   If you look at amphibians and reptiles,
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.280]   they don't have a diaphragm.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.440]   And the way they breathe is not by actively inspiring
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.480]   and passively expiring.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:46.160]   They breathe by actively expiring and passively inspiring
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.560]   because they don't have a powerful inspiratory muscle.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:55.560]   And somewhere along the line, the diaphragm developed.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.280]   And there are lots of theories about how it developed.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.760]   I don't think it's particularly clear.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   There was something you can find in alligators and lizards.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.920]   That could have turned into a muscle that was a diaphragm.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.280]   The amazing thing about the diaphragm
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.960]   is that it's mechanically extremely efficient.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.680]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.160]   Well, if you look at how oxygen gets from outside the body
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.000]   into the bloodstream, the critical passage
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.920]   is across the membrane in the lung.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.080]   It's called the alveolar capillary membrane.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.440]   The alveolus is part of the lung
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.960]   and the blood runs through capillaries,
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.600]   which are the smallest tubes in the circulatory system.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   And at that point, oxygen can go from the air-filled alveolus
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.320]   into the blood.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.880]   - Which is amazing.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.920]   I find that amazing.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.600]   Even though it's just purely mechanical,
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.320]   the idea that we have these little sacs in our lungs,
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.740]   we inhale and the air goes in
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.000]   and literally the oxygen can pass into the bloodstream.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.480]   - Passes into the bloodstream.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.200]   But the rate at which it passes
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.600]   will depend on the characteristics of the membrane,
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.960]   what the distance is between the alveolus
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.720]   and the blood vessel, the capillary.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.000]   But the key element is the surface area.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.800]   The bigger the surface area,
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.320]   the more oxygen that can pass through.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.240]   It's entirely a passive process.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.700]   There's no magic about making oxygen go in.
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.700]   Now, how do you pack a large surface area in a small chest?
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.900]   Well, you start out with one tube, which is the trachea.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.840]   The trachea expands.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.840]   Now you have two tubes.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.340]   Then you have four tubes and it keeps branching.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.580]   At some point, at the end of those branches,
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.060]   you put a little sphere, which is an alveolus.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:56.400]   And that determines what the surface area is going to be.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.640]   Now, you then have a mechanical problem.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.340]   You have the surface area.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.540]   You have to be able to pull it apart.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:08.140]   So imagine you have a little square of elastic membrane.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.020]   It doesn't take a lot of force to pull it apart.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.620]   But now if you increase it by 50 times,
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.020]   you need a lot more force to pull it apart.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.860]   So amphibians who were breathing,
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.780]   not by compressing the lungs
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.980]   and then just passively expanding it,
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.280]   weren't able to generate a lot of force.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.600]   So they have relatively few branches.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.600]   So if you look at the surface area
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.260]   that they pack in their lungs,
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.580]   relative to their body size, it's not very impressive.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.320]   Whereas when you get to mammals,
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.520]   the amount of branching that you have
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.880]   is you have four to 500 million alveoli.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.840]   - If we were to take those four to five million alveoli-
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.760]   - 100 million, 400 to 500 million.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.220]   - 100 million, excuse me, and lay those out flat,
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.020]   what sort of surface area are we talking about?
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.020]   - About 70 square meters,
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.960]   which is about a third the size of a tennis court.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.800]   - Wow.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.240]   - So you have a membrane inside of you,
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.400]   a third the size of a tennis court,
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.680]   that you actually have to expand every breath.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.480]   And you do that without exerting much of a,
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.780]   you don't feel it.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.020]   And that's because you have this amazing muscle,
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.360]   the diaphragm, which because of its positioning,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.360]   just by moving two thirds of an inch down
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.460]   is able to expand that membrane enough
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.760]   to move air into the lungs.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.760]   Now, at rest, the volume of air in your lungs
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.280]   is about two and a half liters.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.380]   Do we need to convert that to courts?
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.220]   - No.
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.320]   - All right, it's about two and a half liters.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.080]   When you take a breath,
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.680]   you're taking another 500 milliliters or half a liter.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.820]   That's the size maybe a little of my fist.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.120]   So you're increasing the volume by 20%,
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.100]   but you're doing that by pulling
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.920]   on this 70 square meter membrane.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.020]   But that's enough to bring enough fresh air into the lung
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.600]   to mix in with the air that's already there,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.720]   that the oxygen levels in your bloodstream
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.000]   goes from a partial pressure of oxygen,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.180]   which is 40 millimeters of mercury
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.120]   to 100 millimeters of mercury.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.600]   So that's a huge increase in oxygen
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.940]   and that's enough to sustain normal metabolism.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.940]   So we have this amazing mechanical advantage
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.640]   by having a diaphragm.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.580]   - Do you think that our brains are larger
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.920]   than that of other mammals in part
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.180]   because of the amount of oxygen
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.800]   that we have been able to bring into our system?
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.500]   - I would say a key step in the ability
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.700]   to develop a large brain that has a continuous demand
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.520]   for oxygen is the diaphragm.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.000]   Without a diaphragm, you're an amphibian.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And there's another solution to increasing oxygen uptake,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.780]   which is the way birds breathe,
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.000]   but birds have other limitations
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.160]   and they still can't get brains as big as mammals have.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:24.160]   The brain utilizes maybe 20% of all the oxygen
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.720]   that we intake and it needs it continuously.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.920]   The brain doesn't wanna be neglected.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.800]   So this puts certain demands on breathing system.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.440]   In other words, you can't shut it down for a while,
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.000]   which poses other issues.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.520]   You're born and you have to mature.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.200]   You have the small body, you have a small lung,
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.120]   you have a very pliant rib cage,
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.200]   and now you have to develop into an adult
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.120]   which has a stiffer rib cage.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.760]   And so there are changes happening in your brain
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.880]   and your body where breathing,
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.660]   the neural control of breathing has to change on the fly.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.520]   It's not like for things like vision
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.800]   where you have the opportunity to sleep.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.880]   And while you're sleeping,
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.520]   the brain is capable of doing things
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.620]   that are not easy to do during wakefulness,
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.720]   like the construction crew comes in during sleep.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.000]   Breathing has been,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   the change in breathing have been described
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.620]   as trying to build an airplane while it's flying.
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.760]   - Basically what Jack is saying
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.720]   is that respiration science is more complex
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.280]   and hardworking than vision science,
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.540]   which is a direct jab at me
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.560]   that some of you might've missed,
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.120]   but I definitely did not miss.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.040]   And I appreciate that you always take the opportunity
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.600]   like a good New Yorker to give me
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.640]   a good, healthy, intellectual jab.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.120]   A question related to diaphragmatic breathing
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.620]   versus non-diaphragmatic breathing,
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.000]   because the way you describe it,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.760]   the diaphragm is always involved.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.820]   But over the years,
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:56.580]   whether it be for yoga class or a breath work thing,
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.340]   or you hear online that we should be breathing
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.300]   with our diaphragm,
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.760]   that rather than lifting our rib cage when we breathe
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.600]   and our chest, that it is healthier, in air quotes,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.160]   or better somehow to have the belly expand when we inhale.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.180]   I'm not aware of any particular studies
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.180]   that have really examined the direct health benefits
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.120]   of diaphragmatic versus non-diaphragmatic breathing.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:24.120]   But if you don't mind commenting on anything you're aware of
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.400]   as it relates to diaphragmatic
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.380]   versus non-diaphragmatic breathing,
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.880]   whether or not people tend to be diaphragmatic breathers
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.240]   by default, et cetera,
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.080]   that would be, I think, interesting to a number of people.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.520]   Well, I think by default, we are obligate diaphragm breathers.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.840]   There may be pathologies where the diaphragm is compromised
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.360]   and you have to use other muscles,
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.500]   and that's a challenge.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.800]   It certainly,
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:56.260]   at rest, other muscles can take over.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.160]   But if you need to increase your ventilation,
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.840]   the diaphragm is very important.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.360]   It would be hard to increase your ventilation otherwise.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.920]   - Do you pay attention to whether or not
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.320]   you are breathing in a manner where your belly
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.860]   goes out a little bit as you inhale?
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.120]   Because I can do it both ways, right?
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.440]   I can inhale, bring my belly in,
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.260]   or I can inhale, push my diaphragm and belly out,
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.080]   not the diaphragm out.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.060]   And that's interesting, right?
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.840]   Because it's a completely different muscle set
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.260]   for each version.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:33.260]   - Well, in the context of things like breath practice,
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:37.540]   I'm a bit agnostic about the effects
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.580]   of some of the different patterns of breathing.
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:44.780]   Clearly, some are gonna work through different mechanisms,
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.660]   and we can talk about that.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.500]   But at a certain level, for example,
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.720]   whether it's primarily diaphragm
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.940]   where you move your abdomen or not,
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.620]   I am agnostic about it.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:00.260]   I think that the changes that breathing induces
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.540]   in emotion and cognition,
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.920]   I have different ideas about what the influence is.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.220]   And I don't see that primarily as how,
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.140]   which particular muscles you're choosing.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.100]   But that just could be my own prejudice.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:17.940]   - Okay.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.860]   And we will return to that as a general theme
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.700]   in a little bit.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.780]   I wanna ask you about sighing.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:30.780]   One of the many great gifts that you've given us
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:35.460]   over the years is an understanding of these things
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.260]   that we call physiological sighs.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.380]   Could you tell us about physiological sighs,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.380]   what's known about them,
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.820]   what your particular interest in them is,
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.560]   and what they're good for?
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.260]   - Very interesting and important question.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.260]   So everyone has a sense of what a sigh is.
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:02.140]   We certainly, when we're emotional in some ways,
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.860]   we're stressed, we're particularly happy,
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.180]   we'll take a, we'll sigh.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:12.600]   It turns out that we're sighing all the time.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.140]   And when I would ask people
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.980]   who are not particularly knowledgeable
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.800]   that haven't read my papers or James Nestor's book
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.980]   or listened to your podcast,
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.080]   they're usually off by two orders of magnitude
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.260]   about how frequently we sigh on the low side.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:35.260]   In other words, they say once an hour, 10 times a day.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.700]   We sigh about every five minutes.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:42.660]   And I would encourage anyone who finds that
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.660]   to be a unbelievable fact is to lie down in a quiet room
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:53.100]   and just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.840]   and just pay attention to your breathing.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.060]   And you'll find that every couple of minutes
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:03.060]   you're taking a deep breath and you can't stop it.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.680]   You know, it just happens.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.020]   Now why?
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.480]   Well, we have to go back to the lung again.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.680]   The lung has these 500 million alveoli
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.380]   and they're very tiny.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.500]   They're 200 microns across.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.180]   So they're really, really tiny.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:24.100]   And you can think of them as fluid-filled.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.220]   They're fluid-lined.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.580]   And the reason they're fluid-lined
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:31.580]   has to do with the esoterica of the mechanics of that.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.340]   It makes it a little easier to stretch them
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.640]   with this fluid line, which is called surfactant.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.860]   And surfactant is important during development.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:44.860]   It is a determining factor when premature infants are born.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.620]   If they do not have lung surfactant,
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:52.020]   it makes it much more challenging to take care of them
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.620]   than after they have lung surfactant,
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.860]   which is sometime, if I remember correctly,
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.820]   in the late second, early third trimester, which it appears.
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.780]   In any case, it's fluid-lined.
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:06.100]   Now think of a balloon that you would blow up,
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.180]   but now before you blow it up, fill the balloon with water.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.660]   Squeeze all the water out.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.260]   And now when you squeeze all the water out,
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:18.300]   you notice the size of the balloons stick to each other.
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.420]   Why is that?
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.260]   Well, that's because water has what's called surface tension
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.940]   and when you have two surfaces of water together,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.420]   they actually tend to stick to each other.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.900]   Now, when you try and blow that balloon up,
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.080]   you know that it, or you'll notice
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.620]   if you've ever done it before,
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:39.000]   that the balloon is a little harder to inflate
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.900]   than if we're dry on the inside.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:41.740]   Why is that?
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:45.740]   Because you have to overcome that surface tension.
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:50.740]   Well, your alveoli have a tendency to collapse.
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.080]   There's 500 million of them.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.500]   They're not collapsing at a very high rate,
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.860]   but it's a slow rate that's not trivial.
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.340]   And when an alveolus collapses,
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:06.340]   it no longer can receive oxygen or take carbon dioxide out.
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.680]   It's sort of taken out of the equation.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.820]   Now, if you have 500 million of them and you lose 10,
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:15.460]   no big deal, but if they keep collapsing,
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.980]   you can lose a significant part
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.680]   of the surface area of your lung.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:24.240]   Now, a normal breath is not enough to pop them open,
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.500]   but if you take a deep breath, it pops them open.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.600]   - Through nose or mouth.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.800]   - Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.340]   Or it's just increased that lung volume
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.700]   'cause you're just pulling on the lungs, they'll pop open.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.300]   About every five minutes.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.540]   And so we're doing it every five minutes
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.740]   in order to maintain the health of our lung.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.580]   In the early days of mechanical ventilation,
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.760]   which was used to treat polio victims
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.020]   who had weakness of their respiratory muscles,
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:00.060]   they'd be put in these big steel tubes
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.760]   and the way they would work is that the pressure
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.100]   outside the body would drop.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:09.100]   That would put a expansion pressure on the lungs,
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.300]   excuse me, on the rib cage.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.900]   The rib cage would expand and then the lung would expand
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.020]   and then the pressure would go back to normal
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:19.760]   and the lung and rib cage would go back to normal.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.180]   There was a, this was great for getting ventilation,
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.580]   but there was a relatively high mortality rate.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:31.020]   It was a bit of a mystery and one solution
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.580]   was to just give bigger breaths.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.860]   They gave bigger breaths and the mortality rate dropped.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.660]   And it wasn't until, I think it was the '50s,
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.860]   where they realized that they didn't have to increase
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.900]   every breath to be big.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.940]   What they needed to do is every so often
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.180]   they'd have one big breath.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.140]   So you have a couple of minutes of normal breaths
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.400]   and then one big breath,
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.460]   just mimicking the physiological size
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.080]   and then the mortality rate dropped significantly.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:03.080]   And if you see someone on a ventilator in the hospital,
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.680]   if you watch every couple of minutes
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.920]   that you see the membrane move up and down,
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.280]   every couple of minutes there'll be a super breath
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.640]   and that pops it open.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:17.640]   So there are these mechanisms for these physiological size.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.620]   So just like with the collapse of the lungs
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:25.360]   where you need a big pressure to pop it open,
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.960]   it's the same thing with the alveoli.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.760]   You need a bigger pressure
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.960]   and a normal breath is not enough.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.480]   So you have to take a big inhale. (exhales)
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.460]   And what nature has done is instead of requiring us
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.000]   to remember to do it, it does it automatically.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.440]   And it does it about every five minutes.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.740]   And one of the questions we asked is,
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.960]   how is this happening?
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.320]   Why every five minutes?
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.440]   What's doing it?
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.440]   And we got into it through a back door.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.660]   Typical of the way a lot of science gets done,
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:05.660]   there's a serendipitous event where you run across a paper
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:10.620]   and something clicks and you just, you follow it up.
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.420]   Sometimes you go down blind ends,
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.260]   but this turned out to be incredibly productive.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.720]   One of the guys in my lab was reading a paper about stress.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.320]   And during stress, lots of things happen in the body.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.520]   One of which is that the hypothalamus,
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.460]   which is very reactive to body state,
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.160]   releases peptides, which are specialized molecules
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.080]   which then circulate throughout the brain and body
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.920]   that have particular effects,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.920]   usually to help deal better with the stress.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.460]   And one class of the peptides that are released
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.560]   are called bombicin-related peptides.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:51.800]   And he also realized, because he was a breathing guy,
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.640]   that when you stress, you sigh more.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.020]   So we said, all right, maybe they're related.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.500]   Bombicin is relatively cheap to buy.
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.160]   We said, let's buy some bombicin,
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.660]   throw it in the brain stem, let's see what happens.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:12.660]   And one of the nice things about some experiments
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:16.560]   that we try to design is to fail quickly.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.620]   So here we had the idea, we throw bombicin in
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.640]   and if bombicin did nothing,
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.200]   nothing lost, maybe $50 to buy the bombicin.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.460]   But if it did something, it might be of some interest.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.440]   So one afternoon, he did the experiment
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.060]   and he comes to me, he says,
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.900]   I won't quote exactly what he said
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.280]   because it might need to be censored,
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.780]   but he said, look at this.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.460]   And it was in a rat.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.180]   Rats sigh about every two minutes.
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.400]   They're smaller than we are
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.640]   and they need to sigh more often.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.640]   Their sigh rate went from 20 to 30 per hour
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.360]   to 500 per hour when he put bombicin into
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.820]   the pre-Botsinger complex.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.920]   - Amazing.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.620]   - And the way he did that is he took a very,
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:07.620]   very fine glass needle and anesthetized a rat
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.540]   and inserted that needle directly
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.440]   into the pre-Botsinger complex.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.040]   So it wasn't a generalized delivery of the peptide,
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.160]   it was localized to the pre-Botsinger
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.040]   and the sigh rate went through the roof.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.160]   - And I would add that that was an important experiment
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.080]   to deliver the bombicin directly to that site
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.160]   because one could have concluded that the injection
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.720]   of the bombicin increased sign because it increased stress
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.960]   rather than directly increase sign.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.800]   - Amongst hundreds of other possible interpretations.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.320]   So the precision here is very important
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.160]   and that goes back to what I said at the very beginning.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.520]   Knowing where this is happening allows you
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.240]   to do the proper investigations.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.500]   If we didn't know where the inspiratory rhythm
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.180]   is originating, we never could have done this experiment.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.860]   And so then we did another experiment.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:00.860]   We said, okay, what happens if we take the cells
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:04.860]   in the pre-Botsinger that are responding to the peptide?
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:08.060]   So neurons will respond to a peptide
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:11.740]   because they have specialized receptors for that peptide.
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:15.260]   And not every neuron expresses those receptors.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.300]   In the pre-Botsinger complex,
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.560]   it's probably a few hundred out of thousands.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:25.420]   So we used the technique we had used before.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:28.700]   And this is a technique developed by Doug Lappe
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:33.700]   down in San Diego where you could take a peptide
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:39.400]   and conjugate it with a molecule called saprin.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.660]   Saprin is a plant-derived molecule
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.220]   which is a cousin to ricin.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.820]   And many of your listeners may have heard of ricin.
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.740]   - It's a ribosomal toxin.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.180]   - It's very nasty.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:56.540]   A single stab with an umbrella will kill you,
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.340]   which is something that supposedly happened
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.380]   to a Bulgarian diplomat by a Russian operative
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.020]   on a bridge in London.
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:04.940]   He got stabbed.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.460]   And the way ricin works is it goes inside a cell,
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.340]   crosses the cell membrane, goes inside the cell,
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.180]   kills the cell, then it goes to the next cell,
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.620]   and then the next cell, and then the next cell.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.560]   It's extremely dangerous.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.100]   In fact, it's firstly impossible to work on in a lab
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.180]   in the United States.
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:26.660]   They won't let you touch it. - Ricin.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:27.500]   - Ricin.
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.420]   - 'Cause we've worked with saprin many times.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:35.060]   - Saprin is safe because it doesn't cross cell membranes.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.220]   So you get an injection of saprin,
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.820]   it won't do anything 'cause it stays outside of cells.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.220]   Please, nobody do that,
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.060]   even though it doesn't cross cell membranes.
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.860]   Please, nobody inject saprin,
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:49.020]   whether or not you are a operative or otherwise.
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.340]   - Thank you, Andrew, for protecting me there.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:56.860]   But what Doug Lappe figured out is that
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:01.260]   when a ligand binds to a receptor,
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.200]   that's when a molecule binds to its receptor,
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:09.020]   in many cases, that receptor ligand complex
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.820]   gets pulled inside the cell.
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.420]   So it goes from the membrane of the cell inside the cell.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.060]   - It's sort of like you can't go to the dance alone,
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.260]   but if you're coupled up, you get in the door.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.160]   - That's right.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.060]   So what he figured out is he put saprin to the peptide,
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:26.580]   the peptide binds to its receptor, it gets internalized,
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.740]   and then when it's inside the cell,
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.760]   saprin does the same thing that ricin does.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.920]   It kills the cell, but then it can't go into the next cell.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.820]   So the only cells that get killed,
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:40.340]   or the more polite term, ablated,
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.940]   are cells that express that receptor.
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.780]   So if you have a big conglomeration of cells,
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.900]   you have a few thousand,
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.940]   and only 50 of them express that receptor,
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.440]   then you inject the saprin conjugated to the ligand,
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.100]   to the peptide, and only those 50 cells die.
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:03.680]   So we took bombicin conjugated to saprin,
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:07.740]   injected in the pre-butzinger complex of rats,
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.860]   and it took about a couple of days
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:14.860]   for the saprin to actually ablate cells.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.420]   And what happened is that the mice started sighing
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:22.860]   less and less, excuse me, the rats started sighing less
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:26.640]   and less and less and less, and essentially stopped sighing.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:31.580]   - So your student, or postdoc was it,
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.680]   murdered these cells, and as a consequence,
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.540]   the sighing goes away.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.660]   What was the consequence of eliminating sighing
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:44.660]   on the internal state or the behavior of the rats?
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:49.980]   Did they, in other words, if one can't sigh,
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.500]   generate physiological sighs,
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.140]   what is the consequence on state of mind?
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.060]   You would imagine that carbon dioxide
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.220]   would build up more readily or to higher levels
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.660]   in the bloodstream,
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.300]   and that the animals would be more stressed.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.620]   That's the kind of logical extension of the way
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:07.660]   we set it up.
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:11.100]   - It was less benign than that.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.460]   When the animals got to the point where they weren't sighing,
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:19.260]   then, and we did not determine this,
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.780]   but the presumption was that their lung function
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:26.780]   significantly deteriorated, and their whole health
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:31.500]   deteriorated significantly, and we had to sacrifice them.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.420]   So I can't tell you whether they were stressed or not,
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:38.060]   but their breathing got to be significantly
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:44.420]   deteriorated that we sacrificed them at that point.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:48.140]   Now we don't know whether that is specifically related
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:50.220]   to the fact they didn't sigh,
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.460]   or that there was secondary damage due to the fact
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.060]   that some cells die, so we never determined that.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:00.660]   Now, after we did this study,
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:04.180]   to be candid, it wasn't a high priority for us
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.780]   to get this out the door and publish it.
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.260]   So it stayed on the shelf.
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:13.300]   And then I got a phone call from a graduate student
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:17.620]   at Stanford, Kevin Yackel, who starts asking me
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:22.380]   all these interesting questions about breathing.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.660]   And I'm happy to answer them, but at some point,
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.780]   it concerned me because he was working
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:32.220]   for a renowned biochemist who worked on lung
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:36.300]   in Drosophila, fruit flies, Mark Krasnow.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.980]   - Yeah, got my next door colleague.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.820]   - Right, and I said, "Why are you asking me this?"
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.540]   And he said, "I was an undergraduate at UCLA,
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.180]   "and you gave a lecture in my undergraduate class,
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.580]   "and I was curious about breathing ever since."
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.060]   So that's one of those things which, as a professor,
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.700]   you love to hear, that actually is something
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.660]   you really affected the life of a student.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:57.980]   - Well, and you birthed a competitor,
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.580]   but you had only yourself to blame.
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.220]   - No, I don't look at that as a competitor.
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:06.300]   I think that there's enough interesting things to go on.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.320]   I know some of our neuroscience colleagues say,
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.040]   "You can work on my lab, but then when you leave my lab,
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.500]   "you gotta work on something different."
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.260]   - No one I ever trained with said that.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.100]   It's open field.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.000]   You wanna work on something, you hop in the mix.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.360]   - But there are people like that, neuroscientists like that.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.200]   I never felt like that.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.380]   - I hear that their breathing apparatus are disrupted,
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.060]   and it causes a brain dysfunction that leads to the behavior
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.280]   you just described.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.380]   It's actually not true.
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:35.740]   But in terms of the, so before we talk about
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:41.480]   the beautiful story with Yackel and Krasnow and Feld lab,
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:46.180]   I want to just make sure that I understand.
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:49.180]   So if physiological sighs don't happen,
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:54.260]   basically breathing overall suffers.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.660]   - Well, that would go back to the observations
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.260]   in polio victims in these iron lungs
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:04.260]   where the principle deficit was there was no hyperinflation
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:07.960]   in the lungs and many of them deteriorated and died.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.620]   - And just to stay on this one more moment
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:14.040]   before we move to what you were about to describe,
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:19.060]   we hear often that people will overdose on drugs
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:22.180]   of various kinds because they stop breathing.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.080]   So barbiturates, alcohol combined with barbiturates
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.740]   is a common cause of death for drug users
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:32.300]   and contraindications of drugs and these kinds of things.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.200]   You hear all the time about celebrities dying
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.480]   because they combined alcohol with barbiturates.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.700]   Is there any evidence that the sighs that occur
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:43.700]   during sleep or during states of deep, deep relaxation
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:51.900]   and sedation that sighs recover the brain?
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.500]   Because you could imagine that if these sighs don't happen
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:58.880]   as a consequence of some drug impacting these brain centers,
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.260]   that that could be one cause
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:03.300]   of basically asphyxiation and death.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:08.300]   - If you look at the progression of any mammal to death,
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:15.220]   you find that their breathing slows down,
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:18.160]   a death due to quote natural causes.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.760]   Their breathing slows down.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.960]   It will stop and then they'll gasp.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:28.960]   So we have the phrase dying gas, super large breaths.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:34.540]   They're often described as an attempt to auto resuscitate.
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.620]   That is you take that super deep breath
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.880]   and that maybe it can kickstart the engine again.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:45.060]   We do not know the degree to such things as gas
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.700]   are really sighs that are particularly large.
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:52.940]   And so if you suppress the ability to gasp
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:57.220]   in an individual who is subject to an overdose,
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.980]   then whereas they might been able
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:03.100]   to re-arouse their breathing,
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.820]   if that's prevented, they don't get re-aroused.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.980]   So that is certainly a possibility.
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:13.520]   But this has not been investigated.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:17.400]   I mean one of the things that I'm interested in
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.640]   is in individuals who have
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   diseases which will affect pre-Butzinger complex.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:32.400]   And there's data in Parkinson's disease
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.060]   and multiple system atrophy,
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.640]   which is another form of neurodegeneration
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.400]   where there's loss of neurons in pre-Butzinger.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:46.780]   And the question is, and it also may happen in ALS,
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:50.160]   sometimes referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease,
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.060]   and mitral foot glottal sclerosis.
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:57.860]   These individuals often die during sleep.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:03.560]   We have an idea that we have not been able
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.260]   to get anyone to test,
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:11.260]   is that patients with Parkinson's, patients with MLS,
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:16.480]   typically breathe normally during wakefulness.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.240]   The disturbances that they have in breathing
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.080]   is during sleep.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:24.380]   So Parkinson's patients at the end stages of the disease
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:28.020]   often have significant disturbances in their sleep pattern,
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.040]   but not during wakefulness.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.860]   And we think that what could be happening
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:37.260]   is that the proximate cause of death is not heart failure,
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.020]   is that they become apneic,
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.380]   they stop breathing and don't resuscitate.
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:46.820]   And that resuscitation may or may not be due
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.740]   to an explicit suppression of size,
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.720]   but to an overall suppression of the whole apparatus
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.800]   of the pre-Butzinger complex.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.180]   - Got it, thank you.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.400]   So Yackel calls you up.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:04.400]   - So he calls me up and he's great kids, super smart.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:10.000]   And he tells me about these experiments that he's doing
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.240]   where he's looking at a database
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.000]   to try and find out what molecules are enriched
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.440]   in regions of the brain that are critical for breathing.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.420]   So we and others have mapped out these regions
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:25.200]   in the brain stem.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.540]   And he was looking at one of these databases
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:29.460]   to see what's enriched.
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.120]   And I said, that's great.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.560]   We'd be willing to sort of share our work together.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.420]   He says, no, my advisor doesn't want me to do that.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:43.340]   So I said, okay, but Kevin's a great kid.
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:48.180]   And I enjoyed talking to him and he's a smart guy.
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:53.180]   And what I found in academia is that the smartest people
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:58:00.120]   only wanna hire people smarter than them
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.520]   and have the preference to interact
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.400]   with people smarter than them.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.700]   The faculty who are not at the highest level
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:12.400]   and at every institution, there's a distribution.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.620]   There are ones above the mean and those below the mean.
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.760]   Those who below the mean are very threatened by that.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:23.660]   And I saw Kevin as like a shining light
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.720]   and I didn't care whether he was gonna out-compete me
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:29.820]   because whatever he did was gonna help me in the field.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:34.020]   So I did whatever I can to help to work with Kevin.
[00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:37.880]   So at one point, I got invited to give grand rounds
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.160]   in neurology at Stanford.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:43.200]   Turns out an undergraduate student who had worked with me
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.020]   was now head of the training program for neurologists
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:49.040]   at Stanford and he invited me.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.000]   And at the end of my visit,
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.400]   I go to Mark Krausner's office and Kevin is there
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.560]   and a postdoc Pungley who was also working
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.920]   on a project was there.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.740]   And towards the end of the conversation,
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:13.780]   Mark says to me, "You know, we found this one molecule
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:18.100]   "which is highly concentrated in an important region
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.140]   "for breathing."
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:22.700]   I said, "Oh, that's great, what is it?"
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.140]   And he says, "I can't tell you
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.780]   "because we wanna work on it."
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:31.460]   So of course I'm disappointed but I realized
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:35.820]   that the ethic in some areas of science
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:38.100]   or the custom in some areas of science
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:40.100]   is that until you get a publication,
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.820]   you'll be relatively restricted in sharing information.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.520]   Mark and I are gonna have a chat when I get back.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.300]   Well, he may remember the story differently
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.760]   but I said, "Okay."
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.700]   And as I'm walking out the door,
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:54.720]   I remember these experiments I described to you
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.920]   about bombastin and that was the only unusual molecule
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.200]   we're working in.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.480]   So the reason I'm rushing out the door
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.280]   is I have a flight to catch.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.540]   So I stick my head in and I said,
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:09.580]   "Is this molecule related to bombastin?"
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.140]   And then I run off, I don't even wait for them to reply.
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:16.500]   I get to the airport, Mark calls me and he says,
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:20.120]   "Bombastin, the peptide we found is related to bombastin,
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   "what does it do?"
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.480]   And I said, "I'm not telling."
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.160]   (laughing)
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.480]   - Oh my.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.720]   - I'm so glad I wasn't involved in this collaboration.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.880]   - No, no, but that was sort of a tease
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.880]   'cause I said, "Well, let's work together on this."
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:36.720]   And then we worked together on this.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.060]   - It was a prisoner's dilemma at that point, yeah.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:46.380]   So Kevin Yackel is spectacular, has his own lab at UCSF
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:50.360]   and the work that I'm familiar with from Kevin
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.460]   is worth mentioning now, or I'll ask you to mention it,
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.120]   which is this reciprocal relationship
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.560]   between brain state,
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.040]   where we could even say emotional state and breathing.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.680]   And I'd love to get your thoughts
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.680]   on how breathing interacts with other things in the brain.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.800]   You've beautifully described how breathing controls
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.640]   the lungs, the diaphragm and the interactions
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.660]   between oxygen and carbon dioxide and so forth.
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:19.620]   But as we know, when we get stressed, our breathing changes.
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:22.800]   When we're happy and relaxed, our breathing changes.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.760]   But also if we change our breathing,
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.020]   we in some sense can adjust our internal state.
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:33.240]   What is the relationship between brain state and breathing?
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.780]   And if you would, because I know you have a particular love
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.440]   of one particular aspect of this,
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.680]   what is the relationship between brain rhythms,
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.480]   oscillations, if you will, and breathing?
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.840]   - This is a topic which has really intrigued me
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.600]   over the past decade.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.720]   I would say before that, I was in my silo,
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.840]   just interested about how the rhythm of breathing
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.640]   is generated and didn't really pay much attention
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.180]   to this other stuff.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:06.040]   For some reason, I got interested in it.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.120]   And I think it was triggered by an article
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.120]   in the New York Times about mindfulness.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.080]   Now, believe it or not, although I'd lived in California
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.480]   for 20 years at that time, I never heard of mindfulness.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.000]   It's staggering how isolated you can be from the real world.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.080]   And I Googled it, and there was a mindfulness institute
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.280]   at UCLA, and they were giving courses in meditation.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:33.580]   So I said, oh, this is great, because I can now see
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:36.880]   whether or not the breathing part of meditation
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.280]   has anything to do with the purported effects of meditation.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.080]   So I signed up for the course.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.880]   And as I joked to you before, I had two goals.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.600]   One was to see whether or not breathing had an effect,
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.680]   and the other was to levitate.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.480]   Because I grew up with all these kung fu things,
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.800]   and all the monks could levitate when they meditated,
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.680]   so why not?
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.320]   We have a model in the lab.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.640]   You can't do anything interesting
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.380]   if you're afraid of failing.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:08.000]   And if I fail to levitate, well, at least I tried.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.080]   And I should tell you now, I still haven't done it yet,
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.880]   but I haven't given up yet.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.840]   I haven't given up.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.160]   So I took this course in mindfulness,
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:22.160]   and it became apparent to me that the breathing part
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.120]   was actually critical.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.720]   It wasn't simply a distraction or a focus.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:32.720]   They could move your index finger to the same effect.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.560]   But I really believed that the breathing part was involved.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.660]   Now, I'm not an unbiased observer,
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:43.200]   so the question is, how can I demonstrate that?
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.640]   I didn't feel competent to do experiments in humans,
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.020]   and I didn't feel I could design
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.280]   the right experiments in humans,
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.340]   but I felt maybe I could study this in rodents.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.680]   So we got this idea that we're gonna teach rodents
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:03.680]   to meditate, and that's laughable.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.280]   But we said, but if we can,
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.200]   then we can actually study how this happens.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.840]   So believe it or not,
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.240]   I was able to get a sort of a starter grant,
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.240]   an R21 from NCCIH.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.960]   That's the National Complementary Medicine Institute.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.760]   - A wonderful institute I should mention.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.000]   Our government puts major tax dollars
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.760]   toward studies of things like meditation,
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.240]   breath work, supplements, herbs, acupuncture.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.160]   This is, I think, not well known,
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.920]   and it's an incredible thing
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.000]   that our government does that,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.480]   and I think it deserves a nod, and more funding.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.960]   - I totally agree with you.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.200]   I think that it's the kind of thing that many of us,
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.240]   including many scientists,
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.760]   thinks is too woo-woo and unsubstantiated.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.060]   But we're learning more and more.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.920]   We used to laugh at neuroimmunology,
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.440]   that the nervous system didn't have anything
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.040]   to do with the immune system.
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.400]   And pain itself can influence your immune system.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.560]   I mean, there are all these things that we're learning
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.320]   that we used to dismiss,
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.880]   and I think there's real nuggets to be learned here.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.040]   So they went out on a limb,
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.720]   and they funded this particular project.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.120]   And now I'm gonna leap ahead,
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.160]   because for three years,
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.500]   we threw stuff up against the wall that didn't work.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:37.500]   And recently, we had a major breakthrough.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:42.720]   We found a protocol by which we can get mice
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.680]   to breathe slowly, awake mice to breathe slowly.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.480]   I won't tell you.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.860]   - Normally, they don't breathe slowly.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.700]   - No, no.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.140]   In other words, whatever their normal breath is,
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:55.220]   we could slow it down by a factor of 10,
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:56.660]   and they're fine doing that.
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:59.220]   So we could do that for,
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.660]   we did that 30 minutes a day
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.360]   for four weeks, okay?
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.720]   Like a breath practice.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:06.720]   - Do they levitate?
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.360]   - We haven't measured that yet.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.440]   I would say a priori,
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.800]   we haven't seen them floating to the top of their cage,
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.800]   but we haven't weighed them.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.440]   Maybe they weigh less.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.680]   You know, maybe, you know, levitation is graded.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.280]   And so maybe if you weigh less,
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   it's sort of a partial levitation.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.120]   In any case,
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:30.800]   we then tested them.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:34.560]   And we had control animals, mice,
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.120]   where we did everything the same,
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.600]   except the manipulation we made
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.960]   did not slow down their breathing.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.100]   So, but they went through everything else.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:47.380]   We then put them through a standard fear conditioning,
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.920]   which we did with my colleague, Michael Fanzolo,
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.680]   who's one of the real gurus of fear.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:58.200]   And we measured a standard test
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.740]   is to put mice in a condition
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:05.260]   where they're concerned that we receive a shock,
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.840]   and their response is that they freeze.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.560]   And the measure of how fearful they are
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.960]   is how long they freeze.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.880]   This is well validated,
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   and it's way above my pay grade to describe
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.600]   the validity of the test, but it's very valid.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:26.800]   The control mice had a freezing time,
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.640]   which was just the same as ordinary mice would have.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.440]   The ones that went through our protocol
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.120]   froze much, much less.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.200]   According to Michael,
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.960]   the degree to which they showed less freezing
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.180]   was as much as if there was a major manipulation
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:48.600]   in the amygdala, which is a part of the brain
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.040]   that's important in fear processing.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.500]   It's a staggering change.
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.960]   The problem we have now is the grant ran out of money,
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.160]   the postdoc working on it left,
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.160]   and now we have to try and piece together everything.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.040]   But the data is spectacular.
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.500]   - Well, I think I'll just pause you for a moment there,
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.180]   because I think that you're talking about a rodent study,
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:14.120]   but I think the benefits of doing rodent studies
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.740]   that you can get deep into mechanism,
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:20.440]   and for people that might think,
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.760]   well, we've known that meditation has these benefits,
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.660]   why do you need to get mechanistic science?
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.160]   I think that one thing that's important
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.080]   for people to remember is that, first of all,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.720]   as many people as one might think are meditating out there
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.440]   or doing breath work,
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.920]   a far, far, far greater number of people are not, right?
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.320]   I mean, the majority of people don't take any time
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.320]   to do dedicated breath work nor meditate.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:50.620]   So whatever can incentivize people would be wonderful.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:53.360]   But the other thing is that it's never really been clear
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.260]   to me just how much meditation is required
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.700]   for a real effect, meaning a practical effect.
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.840]   People say 30 minutes a day, 20 minutes a day,
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.780]   once a week, twice a week, same thing with breath work.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.620]   Finding minimum or effective thresholds
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.820]   for changing neural circuitry
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:13.740]   is what I think is the holy grail of all these practices.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.140]   And that's only going to be determined
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.380]   by the sorts of mechanistic studies that you describe.
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.480]   So this is wonderful.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.340]   I do hope the work gets completed,
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.500]   and we can talk about ways that we can ensure
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.280]   that that happens, but-
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:28.320]   - But let me add one thing to what you're saying, Andrew.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.720]   One of the issues I think for a lot of people
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.400]   is that there's a placebo effect.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.140]   That is, in humans, they can respond to something
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.440]   even though the mechanism has nothing to do
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.440]   with what the intervention is.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.580]   And so it's easy to say that the meditative response
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.640]   has a big component, which is the placebo effect.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.420]   My mice don't believe in the placebo effect.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:58.240]   And so if we could show there's a bona fide effect in mice,
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.160]   it is convincing in ways that no matter
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.220]   how many human experiments you did,
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.720]   the control for the placebo effect
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.880]   is extremely difficult in humans.
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.580]   In mice, it's a non-issue.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:12.060]   So I think that that in and of itself
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.480]   would be an enormous message to send.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.480]   - Excellent, and indeed a better point.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:22.620]   I think a 30-minute-a-day meditation in these mice,
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:27.100]   if I understand correctly, the meditation,
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:27.940]   we don't know what they're thinking about.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:28.780]   - Well, it's breath practice really.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.200]   - Right, so it's breath practice.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.660]   So because we don't, presumably they're not thinking
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.280]   about their third eye center, lotus position, levitation,
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.120]   whatever it is, they're not instructed as to what to do.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.440]   And if they were, they probably wouldn't do it anyway.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:44.460]   So 30 minutes a day in which breathing is deliberately slowed
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.100]   or is slowed relative to their normal patterns of breathing.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:48.940]   Got it.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:54.340]   What was the frequency of sighing during that 30 minutes?
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:55.320]   Unclear? - We don't know yet.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.560]   Well, no, we have the data.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.420]   We just, we're analyzing the data.
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:01.220]   - To be determined or to be announced at some point.
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:06.220]   So the fear centers are altered in some way
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:10.880]   that creates a shorter fear response to a foot shock.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.500]   - Right.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.700]   What are some other examples that you are aware of
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.280]   from work in your laboratory or work in other laboratories
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.140]   for that matter about interactions between breathing
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.420]   and brain state or emotional state?
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:25.380]   - So this gets back to our prior conversation.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.180]   I sort of went off on that tangent.
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:33.540]   We need, I think we need to think separately
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:37.860]   of the effect of volitional changes of breathing
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:42.860]   on emotion versus the effect of brain state on breathing.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:49.700]   So the effect of brain state on breathing,
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:54.260]   like when you're stressed is an effect
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:57.460]   or presumably originating in higher centers,
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.160]   if I can use that term, affecting breathing.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.680]   It's the reciprocal is that when you change breathing,
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.700]   it affects your emotional state.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:11.180]   I think of those two things as different
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.100]   than they ultimately be tied together.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.540]   So there's a landmark paper published in the '50s
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:20.500]   where they stimulated in the amygdala of cats.
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.460]   And depending on where they stimulated,
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:25.340]   they got profound changes in breathing.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.860]   There's like every pattern of breathing
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.500]   could possibly imagine they found a site in the amygdala
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.300]   which could produce that.
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.420]   So there's clearly a powerful descending effect
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:38.140]   coming from the amygdala, which is a major site
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.140]   for processing emotion, fear, stress, and whatnot
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:43.180]   that can affect breathing.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:45.820]   And clearly we have volitional control over breathing.
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.700]   So we have profound effects there.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.100]   Now I should say about emotional control of breathing,
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:55.280]   I need to segue into talking about locked-in syndrome.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.260]   Locked-in syndrome is a devastating lesion
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.980]   that happens in a part of the brainstem
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:07.980]   where signals that controlled muscles are transmitted.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:12.620]   So the fibers coming from your motor cortex
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:16.580]   go down through this part of the brainstem,
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:19.260]   which is called the ventral pons.
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:21.900]   And if there's a stroke there,
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:25.180]   it can damage these pathways.
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:28.100]   What happens in individuals who have locked-in syndrome
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.860]   is they lose all volitional movement
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.380]   except lateral movement of the eyes
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.460]   and maybe the ability to blink.
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:39.700]   The reason they're able to still blink and move their eyes
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:44.700]   is that those control centers are rostral,
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:47.580]   closer to, are not interrupted.
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.480]   In other words, the interruption is below that.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:55.780]   They continue to breathe because the centers for breathing
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:58.380]   don't require that volitional command.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.060]   In any case, they're below that.
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.380]   So they're fine.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.500]   So these people continue to breathe.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:08.500]   Normal intelligence, but they can't move.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.060]   There's a great book called
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.540]   "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:16.540]   about a young man who this happens to
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.980]   and he describes his life.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.860]   And it's a real testament to the human condition
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.220]   that he does this.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.340]   It's a remarkable book.
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:27.440]   It's a short book.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.860]   - Did he write the book by blinking two translators?
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:32.580]   - He did it by blinking to his caretaker.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.460]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.180]   And there was a movie which I've never seen
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.760]   with Javier Bardin as the protagonist,
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.480]   but the book I highly recommend to anyone to read.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.420]   So I had colleagues studying an individual
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.720]   who had locked in syndrome.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.660]   And this patient breathed very robotically,
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:57.620]   totally consistent, very regular.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:01.340]   They gave the patient a low oxygen mixture to breathe.
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:03.060]   Ventilation went up.
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.620]   A CO2 mixture to breathe, ventilation went up.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.420]   So all the regulatory apparatus for breathing was there.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.540]   They asked the patient to hold his breath
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.340]   or to breathe faster.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:15.000]   Nothing happened.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.040]   Just the patient recognized the command,
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.060]   but couldn't change it.
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.820]   Then all of a sudden the patient's breathing
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.740]   changed considerably.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.220]   And they said to the patient, "What happened?"
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.140]   They said, "You told a joke and I laughed."
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:29.940]   And they went back.
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:33.220]   Whenever they told a joke that the patient found funny,
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.540]   the patient's breathing pattern changed.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:39.740]   And you know your breathing pattern when you laugh is,
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:42.300]   you know, you inhale, you go ha ha ha ha.
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.940]   But it's also very distinctive.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.220]   We have some neuroscience colleagues who will go unnamed,
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:50.340]   who if you heard them laugh 50 yards away,
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.720]   you know exactly who they are.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.620]   - Yeah, well, I'll name them.
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.900]   Eric Kandel has an inspiratory laugh.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:00.020]   - He's famous for a, as opposed to a ha ha.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.580]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:04.860]   So it's very stereotyped,
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.780]   but it's maintained and these people
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.180]   lose volitional control of breathing.
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:13.700]   So there's an emotive component controlling your breathing,
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:17.780]   which has nothing to do with your volitional control.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:19.780]   And it goes down to a different pathway
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:22.380]   'cause it's not disrupted by this lockdown syndrome.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:27.380]   If you look at motor control of the face,
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.180]   we have the volitional control of the face,
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.780]   but we also have emotional control of the face,
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:36.180]   which most of us can't control.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:38.340]   So when we look at another person,
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.220]   we tend, we're able to read a lot
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.820]   about what their emotional state is.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.500]   And that's a lot about how primates communicate,
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.000]   humans communicate.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.260]   And you have people who are good deceivers,
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.700]   probably used car salesman, poker players,
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:58.440]   or now poker players have tells,
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.320]   but many of them now wear dark glasses
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.640]   because a lot of the tells you blink or whatnot.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.480]   - Pupil size is a tell.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.580]   - Pupil size, pupil size is a tell,
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.700]   which is an autonomic function,
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:13.500]   not a skeletal muscle function.
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.580]   But we have all these skeletal muscles
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:18.460]   which we're controlling, which give us away.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.260]   I've tried to get my imaging friends
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.100]   to image some of the great actors
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.540]   that we have in Los Angeles.
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:28.620]   - You mean brain imagers?
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:29.820]   - Brain imagers, I'm sorry.
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:30.660]   - No, that's all right.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:32.340]   - I mean, yeah, brain imagers.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:37.340]   Because I think when I asked you to smile,
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:41.700]   I could tell that you're not happy,
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.700]   that you're smiling because I asked you to smile.
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.540]   - I think you're about to crack a joke,
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:48.060]   but we're old friends, so.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:53.060]   - No, I'm not, that when you see a picture
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:56.660]   like at a birthday or whatnot and say cheese,
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:58.700]   you could tell that at least half of the people
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.180]   are not happy they're saying cheese.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:06.180]   Whereas a great actor, when they're able to dissemble
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.960]   in the fact that they're sad or they're happy,
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.660]   you believe it, they're not faking it.
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.020]   It's like that's great acting.
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.040]   And I don't think everyone could do that.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.120]   I think that the individuals who are able to do that
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.820]   have some connection to the parts
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.380]   of their emotive control system
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:25.040]   that the rest of us don't have.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.920]   Maybe they develop it through training and maybe not,
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.480]   but I think that this can be imaged.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:33.000]   So I would like to get one of these great actors
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   in a imager and have them go through that
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.280]   and then get a normal person
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.420]   and see whether or not they can emulate that.
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:42.760]   And I think you're gonna find big differences
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.880]   in the way they control this emotive thing.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.360]   So this emotive control of the facial muscles,
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.600]   I think is in large part similar
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.440]   to the emotive control of breathing.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.840]   So there's that emotive control
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:58.240]   and there's that volitional control and they're different.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.360]   They're different.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.760]   Now, you asked me about the Yakko stuff.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.680]   The Yakko paper had to do with ascending,
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.460]   that the effect of breathing on emotion.
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:14.480]   What Kevin found was that there was a population
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.400]   of neurons in the pre-Butsinger complex
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.280]   that were always looking to things
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.400]   that are projecting ultimately emotive neurons.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.060]   He found the population of cells
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.960]   that projected to locus coeruleus.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.840]   Locus coeruleus, excuse me,
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.300]   is one of those places in the brain
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.360]   that seemed to go everywhere.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.680]   - It's like a sprinkler system.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.560]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.800]   And influence mood and you've had podcasts about this.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.220]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on with the amygdala.
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.600]   So, I'm sending the locus coeruleus.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.940]   So you get into the locus coeruleus,
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:50.720]   you can now spray information out
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.160]   throughout the entire brain.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:56.440]   He found specific cells that projected
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:59.480]   from pre-Butsinger to locus coeruleus.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:03.520]   And that these cells are inspiratory modulator.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:09.920]   Now, it's been known for a long time, since the '60s,
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:13.620]   that if you look in the locus coeruleus of cats
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:16.080]   when they're awake, you find many neurons
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.800]   that have respiratory modulation.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.600]   No one paid much attention to them.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.520]   Why bother?
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:23.940]   Not why bother paying attention,
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:26.880]   but why would the brain bother to have these inputs?
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.920]   So what Kevin did with Lindsey Schwartz
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:35.920]   and Leshun Lozliya, is they killed, or bladed,
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:41.320]   those cells going to locus coeruleus from pre-Butsinger.
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.760]   And the animals became calmer.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.680]   And their EEG levels changed in ways
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.900]   that are indicative that they became calmer.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.820]   - And as I recall, they didn't just become calmer,
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:55.520]   but they weren't really capable of high arousal states.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:56.980]   They were kind of flat.
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:01.800]   - I don't think we really pursued that in the paper.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:08.120]   And so we'd have to ask Johnny Huguenin about that, but I-
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.280]   - He's on the other side of my lap, so we'll ask him.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:16.280]   - But nonetheless, that beautifully illustrates
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:21.600]   how there is a bi-directional control, right?
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.440]   - Well, that's a-
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.800]   - Emotion, well, no, the two stories
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:30.720]   of the locked-in syndrome, plus the Yakl paper,
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.480]   shows that emotional states influence breathing,
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.580]   and breathing influences emotional states.
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:38.900]   But you mentioned inspiration,
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.120]   which I always call inhalation,
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.660]   but people will follow, no, no, it's fine.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.160]   Those are interchangeable, people can follow that.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.680]   There's some interesting papers from Noam Sobel's group
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:51.360]   and from a number of other groups that as we inhale,
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.400]   or right after we inhale,
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.560]   the brain is actually more alert and capable
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.480]   of storing information than during exhales,
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.640]   which I find incredible, but it also makes sense.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:04.360]   I'm able to see things far better when my eyes are open
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.800]   than when my eyelids are closed for that matter.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.320]   - Maybe.
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:13.400]   - I don't doubt, Noam's work is great.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:19.840]   Let me backtrack a bit, because I want people to understand
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.560]   that when we're talking about breathing
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.440]   affecting emotional cognitive state,
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.740]   it's not simply coming from pre-Butzinger.
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:33.080]   There are at least, well, there are several other sites,
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.940]   and let me sort of, I need to sort of go through that.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.020]   One is olfaction.
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:41.520]   So when you're breathing, normal breathing,
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.040]   you're inhaling and exhaling.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.200]   This is creating signals coming from the nasal mucosa
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.760]   that is going back into the olfactory bulb
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.920]   that's respiratory modulated.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.620]   And the olfactory bulb has a profound influence
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:00.900]   and projections through many parts of the brain.
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:05.700]   So there's a signal arising from this rhythmic moving of air
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:08.760]   in and out of the nose that's going into the brain
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:12.400]   that has contained in it a respiratory modulation.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.040]   So that signal is there.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.720]   The brain doesn't have to be using it,
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:18.760]   but when it's discriminating over and whatnot,
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.860]   that's riding on a oscillation which is respiratory related.
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:27.240]   Another potential source is the vagus nerve.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.640]   The vagus nerve is a major nerve
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:34.480]   which is containing afferents from all of the viscera.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.540]   - Afferents just being signals too.
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.120]   - Signals from the viscera.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.340]   It also has signals coming from the brain stem down
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.920]   which are called efferents,
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.260]   but it's getting major signals from the lung, from the gut,
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:51.740]   and this is going up into the brain stem.
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:52.980]   So it's there.
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:58.060]   There are very powerful receptors in the lung
[01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:02.260]   that are responding to the lung volume, the lung stretch.
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:04.040]   - Is there barrier receptors?
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:08.480]   - I'm sorry, we have a number like the piezo receptors
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:11.120]   of this year's Nobel Prize, yeah.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:14.960]   - So they're responding to the expansion
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.920]   and relaxation in the lung.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.060]   And so if you record from the vagus nerve,
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:22.800]   you'll see that there's a huge respiratory modulation
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.040]   due to the mechanical changes in the lung.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.560]   Now, why that is of interest is that
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:32.840]   for some forms of refractory depression,
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.640]   electoral stimulation of the vagus nerve
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.720]   can provide tremendous relief.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.600]   Why this is the case still remains to be determined,
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.120]   but it's clear that signals in the vagus nerve,
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.800]   at least artificial signals in the vagus nerve,
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.700]   can have a positive effect on reducing depression.
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:57.200]   So it's not a leap to think that under normal circumstances
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:00.440]   that that rhythm coming in from the vagus nerve
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:04.260]   is playing a role in normal processing.
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:07.040]   Okay, let me continue.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.300]   Carbon dioxide and oxygen levels.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:11.580]   Now, under normal circumstances,
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:14.600]   your oxygen levels are fine.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.800]   And unless you go to altitude,
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.120]   they don't really change very much.
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.280]   But your CO2 levels can change quite a bit
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.240]   with even a relatively small change
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.920]   in your overall breathing.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.820]   That's gonna change your pH level.
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:32.400]   I have a colleague, Alicia Marrette,
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.360]   who is working with patients who are anxious,
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.780]   and many of them hyperventilate.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.560]   And as a result of that hyperventilation,
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.460]   their carbon dioxide levels are low.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:51.620]   And she has developed a therapeutic treatment
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:56.000]   where she trains these people to breathe slower
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.160]   and to restore their CO2 levels back to normal,
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:04.160]   and she gets relief from their anxiety.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:09.800]   So CO2 levels, which are not gonna affect brain function
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.640]   on a breath by breath level,
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:14.820]   although it does fluctuate breath by breath,
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:19.040]   but sort of as a continuous background, can change.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.120]   And if it's changed chronically,
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.760]   we know that highly elevated levels of CO2
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.940]   can produce panic attacks.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:32.820]   And we don't know the degree to that gets exacerbated
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:36.380]   by people who have a panic attack
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:39.020]   to the degree to which their ambient CO2 levels
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:42.860]   are affecting their degree of discomfort.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:46.420]   - What about people who tend to be too calm,
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.420]   meaning that they're feeling sleepy,
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:53.000]   they're underbreathing as opposed to overbreathing?
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.460]   Is there any knowledge of what the status of CO2 is
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:57.440]   in their system?
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:00.000]   - I don't know, which doesn't mean there's no knowledge,
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.660]   but I'm unaware, but that's blissfully unaware.
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:07.420]   I have not looked at that literature, so I don't know.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:09.760]   - And I have a feeling, I mean, most people,
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.620]   or excuse me, most of the scientific literature
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.980]   around breathing in humans that I'm aware of
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.380]   relates to these stressed states
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:17.300]   because they're a little bit easier to study in the lab,
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:19.840]   whereas people feeling understimulated
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.120]   or exhausted all the time,
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.420]   it's a complicated thing to measure.
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:25.100]   I mean, you can do it, but it's not as straightforward.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.020]   - Well, CO2 is easy to measure.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:29.380]   - But in terms of the sort of the measures
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:33.420]   for feeling fatigued, they're somewhat indirect.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:35.900]   Whereas stress, we can get at pulse rates
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.220]   and HRV and things of that sort.
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:41.180]   - Well, I imagine that these devices that we're all wearing
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.580]   will soon be able to measure,
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:45.780]   well, now they can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation.
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:46.820]   - Which is amazing.
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:51.820]   - Yeah, but oxins will pretty much stay above 90%
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:57.500]   unless there's some pathology or you go to altitude.
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.500]   But CO2 levels vary quite a bit.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.380]   And CO2, in fact, because they vary,
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:06.820]   your body is so sensitive, the control of breathing,
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:09.140]   like how much you breathe per minute,
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:14.060]   is determined in a very sensitive way by the CO2 level.
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:17.180]   So even a small change in your CO2
[01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:20.380]   will have a significant effect on your ventilation.
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:23.300]   So this is another thing that not only changes
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.500]   your ventilation, but affects your brain state.
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:30.100]   Now, another thing that could affect breathing,
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.780]   how breathing practice can affect your emotional state
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:36.340]   is simply the descending command.
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:39.340]   Because breathing practice involves volitional control
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:43.060]   of your breathing, and therefore there's a signal
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:46.160]   that's originating somewhere in your motor cortex.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.580]   That is not, of course, that's gonna go down
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:52.420]   to pre-Butzinger, but it's also gonna send off collaterals
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:53.660]   to other places.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:55.660]   Those collaterals could obviously influence
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:56.740]   your emotional state.
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:01.700]   So we have quite a few different potential sources.
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.380]   None of them are exclusive.
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:07.180]   There's an interesting paper which shows that
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:11.940]   if you block nasal breathing,
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:16.060]   you still see breathing-related oscillations in the brain.
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:21.060]   And this is where I think the mechanism is occurring
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:25.380]   is that these breathing-related oscillations in the brain,
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.800]   they are playing a role in signal processing.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.520]   And maybe, should I talk a little bit about the role
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.180]   that oscillations may be playing in signal processing?
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:35.820]   - Definitely, but before you do,
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:39.900]   I just want to ask you a intermediate question.
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:41.540]   We've talked a lot about inhalation,
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:43.560]   inspiration, and exhalation.
[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:46.440]   What about breath holds?
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.780]   You know, in apnea, for instance,
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:50.100]   people are holding their breath,
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:53.780]   whether or not it's conscious or unconscious,
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:55.340]   they're holding their breath.
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:57.660]   What's known about breath holds
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:59.940]   in terms of how it might interact with brain state
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:01.860]   or oxygen CO2?
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:03.980]   And I'm particularly interested in how
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.420]   breath holds with lungs empty
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:07.820]   versus breath holds with lungs full
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.240]   might differ in terms of their impact on the brain.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.140]   I'm not aware of any studies on this.
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.960]   Looking at a mechanistic level,
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.480]   but I find it really interesting.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.820]   And even if there are no studies,
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:20.680]   I'd love it if you'd care to speculate.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:23.460]   - Well, one of the breath practices that intrigued me
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:27.460]   is where you basically hyperventilate for a minute
[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:29.460]   and then hold your breath for as long as you can.
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:33.720]   - Tummo style, Wimlof style, or we call it in the laboratory
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.940]   because frankly, before Tummo and before Wim,
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:42.980]   it was referred to as cyclic hyperventilation.
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:46.400]   So it's basically, right, followed by a breath hold.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.900]   And that breath hold could be done with lungs full
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.180]   or lungs empty.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:52.940]   - So I had a long talk with some colleagues
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:57.480]   about what they might think the underlying mechanisms are,
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.720]   particularly for the breath hold.
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:04.720]   And I certainly envisioned that there's a component
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:10.060]   with respect to the presence or absence of that rhythmicity
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.560]   in your cortex, which is having effect.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.340]   But the other thing with the hyperventilation,
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:17.480]   hypoventilation, or the apnea,
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:23.360]   is your CO2 levels are going from low to high.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.740]   - Anytime you're holding your breath.
[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:26.880]   - Anytime you're holding your breath, okay?
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.560]   And those are gonna have a profound influence.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:34.480]   Now, I have to talk about episodic hypoxia
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:38.020]   'cause there's a lot of work going on,
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:39.380]   particularly with Gordon Mitchell,
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:42.580]   at the University of Florida, is doing some extraordinary work
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.820]   on episodic hypoxia.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:47.480]   So in the '80s, David Millhorn
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.780]   did some really intriguing work.
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:55.700]   If I ask you to hold your breath, excuse me,
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:32:00.700]   if I gave you a low oxygen mixture for a couple of minutes,
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:03.340]   your breathing level would go up
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:05.660]   'cause you wanna have more oxygen.
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:06.480]   - You're starving for air.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:07.980]   - Yeah, no, you're starving for oxygen.
[01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.440]   - Right. - Okay.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:13.620]   And for a couple of minutes, you'd go up,
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:16.320]   you'd reach some steady state level.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.700]   Not so hypoxic that you can't reach an equilibrium.
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.960]   And then I give you a room air again,
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.720]   your ventilation quickly relaxes back down to normal.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:31.020]   If on the other hand, I gave you three minutes of hypoxia,
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.220]   five minutes of normoxia,
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:36.140]   three minutes of hypoxia, five minutes of normoxia,
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.180]   three minutes of hypoxia, five minutes of normoxia.
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:40.500]   - Normoxia being normal. - Normal air.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:45.160]   Your ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.420]   After the last episode, your breathing comes down
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:50.820]   and doesn't continue to come down,
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:55.420]   but rises again and stays up for hours, okay?
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:58.740]   This is well validated now.
[01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:00.220]   This was originally done in animals,
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.660]   but in humans all the time.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.580]   It seems to have profound benefit
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:08.240]   on motor function and cognitive function.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.340]   - In what direction?
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.660]   - Positive, positive.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:14.260]   I've often toyed with the idea of getting a 5%,
[01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:17.380]   an 8% oxygen, don't do this listeners,
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:21.220]   getting an 8% oxygen tank by my desk
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:24.420]   when I'm writing a grant and doing like in Blue Velvet
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:28.220]   and going through the episodic hypoxia
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:30.380]   to improve my cognitive function.
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:31.780]   'Cause certainly could use improvement
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:32.780]   when I'm writing grants.
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:35.940]   - But you could do this without the low oxygen.
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:38.100]   I mean, you could do this through breath work, presumably.
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:42.380]   - It's hard to lower your oxygen enough, okay?
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:44.620]   We're going in the experimental studies,
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:47.140]   they typically use 8% oxygen.
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.240]   It's hard to hold your breath long enough.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.240]   And there is another difference here.
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.380]   That is what's happening to your CO2 levels.
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.220]   When you hold your breath,
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:33:59.380]   your oxygen levels are dropping,
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.660]   your CO2 levels are going up.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:06.340]   When you're doing episodic hypoxia,
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:10.180]   your CO2 levels are going to stay pretty normal.
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:12.300]   'Cause you're still breathing,
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.820]   it's just the oxygen levels are gone.
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:16.580]   - So unlike normal conditions, which you described before,
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:21.220]   where oxygen is relatively constant and CO2 is fluctuating
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:23.400]   depending on emotional state and activity
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.420]   and things of that sort.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:29.060]   In episodic hypoxia, CO2 is relatively constant,
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:30.700]   but you're varying the oxygen level
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:32.340]   coming into the system quite a bit.
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:33.620]   - I would say it's relatively,
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:36.940]   I would say CO2 is relatively constant,
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:40.380]   but it's not going to go in a direction
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:43.780]   which is going to be significantly far from normal.
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:45.780]   Whereas when you're holding your breath,
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.460]   you're going to become both hypoxic
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:49.580]   and hypercapnic at the same time.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:50.500]   - We should explain to people
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.160]   what hypoxic and hypercapnic are,
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.000]   because we haven't done that.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.060]   - Hypoxic is just the technical term
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:55.980]   for low levels of oxygen.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:59.020]   Hyper, or you could say hypoxic, low.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:03.940]   Hyper is high, so hyperoxia, or hypocapnia, low CO2,
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.740]   or hypercapnia, high levels of CO2.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:13.940]   So when you're in episodic hypoxia,
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:16.620]   if anything, you're going to become hypocapnic,
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:20.880]   not hypercapnic, and that could play an influence on this.
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.900]   One example that I remember,
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:27.180]   and Gordon will have to forgive me if I'm misquoting this,
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:32.180]   is they had a patient who had a stroke
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:36.220]   and had weakness in ankle flexion.
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:41.220]   That is, excuse me, ankle extension to extend the ankle.
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:44.300]   And so they had the patient in a seat
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:46.940]   where they could measure ankle extension,
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:49.300]   and then they measured it,
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:53.420]   and then they exposed the patient to episodic hypoxia,
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:57.500]   and they measured again the strength of the ankle extension
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.100]   went way up.
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:01.100]   And so Gordon is looking at this.
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:04.260]   They're looking at this now for spinal cord rehab.
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:08.140]   - And I imagine for all sorts of neuromuscular performance,
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:09.860]   it could be beneficial.
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:12.820]   - Gordon is looking into athletic performance.
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:14.900]   We have a project which we haven't been able
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:18.740]   to push to the next level to do golf.
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:20.580]   So I think- - Why golf?
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:21.820]   'Cause you love golf.
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:26.100]   - Well, it's because it's motor performance, coordination,
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:29.100]   so it's not simply running as fast as you can.
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.100]   It's coordination, it's concentration,
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:33.060]   it's a whole variety of things.
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:36.500]   And so the idea would be to get a group of golfers
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:39.420]   and give them their placebo control
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:41.860]   so they don't know whether they're breathing a gas mixture
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:45.600]   which is just normal air or hypoxic gas mixture,
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.140]   although they may be able to figure it out
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:48.440]   based on their response.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:51.580]   Do it under controlled circumstances
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:53.340]   or do it into a net.
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:55.540]   Measure their length of their drives,
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:58.620]   their dispersion and whatnot, and see what happens.
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:03.160]   Look, if we could find that this works for golfers,
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.460]   forget about cognitive function.
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:09.460]   We could sell this for unbelievable amounts of money.
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.260]   - That sounds like a terrible idea.
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:16.140]   - By the way, I'm not serious about selling it.
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:17.220]   - I know you're joking.
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:19.300]   Maybe people should know that you are joking about that.
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.860]   - No, I think that anything that can improve
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:23.500]   cognitive and neuromuscular performance
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.860]   is gonna be of interest for a wide range
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:30.220]   of both pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera.
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:33.200]   I mean, one of the most frequent questions I get
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:37.180]   is about recovery from concussion or traumatic brain injury.
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:39.220]   A lot of people think sports, they think football,
[01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:41.020]   they think rugby, they think hockey.
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:44.540]   But if you look at the statistics on traumatic brain injury,
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.820]   most of it is construction workers,
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:48.820]   car crashes, bicycle accidents.
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:52.740]   I mean, the sports part of it is a tiny, tiny
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:54.620]   minuscule fraction of the total amount
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:56.420]   of traumatic brain injury out there.
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:59.900]   I think these protocols tested in the context of golf
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:02.300]   would be very interesting because of the constraints
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:03.700]   of the measures, as you mentioned,
[01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:05.860]   and it could be exported to a number of things.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:08.940]   I wanna just try and imagine whether or not
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:13.940]   there is any kind of breathing pattern or breath work,
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:15.780]   just to be direct about it,
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:19.500]   that even partially mimics what you described
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.540]   in terms of episodic hypoxia.
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:24.260]   I've done a lot of tumor Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:25.140]   type breathing before.
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:26.620]   My lab studies this in humans.
[01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:29.860]   And what we find is that if people do
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:32.380]   cyclic hyperventilation, so for about a minute,
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:35.280]   then exhale, hold their breath for 15 to 60 seconds,
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.300]   depending on what they can do,
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:39.000]   and just keep repeating that for about five minutes,
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.380]   it seems to me that it at least partially mimics
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:43.620]   the state that you're talking about.
[01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:46.660]   Because afterwards people report heightened levels
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:51.660]   of alertness, lower levels of kind of triggering
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:54.540]   due to stressful events.
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:56.060]   They feel comfortable at a higher level
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.500]   of autonomic arousal, cognitive focus,
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.780]   a number of improvements that are pretty impressive
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:02.620]   that any practitioner of Wim Hof or tumor
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:03.780]   will be familiar with.
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:09.180]   Is that pattern of breathing even,
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:11.540]   can we say that it maps to what you're describing
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:12.940]   in some general sense?
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:17.500]   Well, the expert in this would be Gordon Mitchell.
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:20.680]   I would say it moves in that direction,
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:23.020]   but it's not as extreme, because I don't think
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:26.180]   you can get down to the levels of hypoxia
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:28.400]   that they do clinically.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:32.060]   I know that our pals at our breath collective
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:34.060]   actually just bought a machine,
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:36.340]   'cause you buy a machine that does this,
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:37.860]   and they bought it and they're gonna do their own
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:40.820]   self-testing to see whether or not this has any effect
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:43.020]   on anything that they can measure.
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.820]   Of course, you have to be concerned
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:46.340]   about self-experimentation,
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:50.980]   but I applaud their curiosity in going after it.
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:52.660]   - Hyperbaric chambers.
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:55.060]   I hear a lot nowadays about hyperbaric chambers.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:56.540]   People are buying them and using them,
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:59.400]   and what are your thoughts on hyperbaric chambers
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:00.460]   as it relates to any of the-
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:01.700]   - Hyper or hypo?
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:03.100]   - Hyperbaric chambers.
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:04.420]   - Okay, so you're not talking about altitude.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:05.900]   - No.
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:08.380]   - I don't really have much to say.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:12.380]   I mean, your oxygen levels will probably go up a little bit,
[01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:14.340]   and that could have a beneficial effect,
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:17.420]   but that's way outside my area of confidence.
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:20.780]   - I think 2022, I think, is going to be the year
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:22.460]   of two things I keep hearing a lot about,
[01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:25.900]   which is the deliberate use of high salt intake
[01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:29.100]   for performance, increasing blood volume, et cetera,
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:31.420]   and hyperbaric chambers seem to be catching on
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:33.780]   much in the same way that ice baths were
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:35.700]   and saunas seem to be right now.
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.740]   But anyway, a prediction we can return to
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:39.500]   at some point.
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:43.980]   I want to ask you about some of the studies
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:46.540]   that I've seen out there exploring
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:50.220]   how deliberately restricting one's breathing
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:53.280]   to nasal breathing can do things like improve memory.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.240]   There's a couple of papers in Journal of Neuroscience,
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.900]   which is a respectable journal in our field,
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:59.500]   one looking at olfactory memory.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.260]   So that kind of made sense
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:03.460]   because you can smell things better through your nose
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:07.020]   than your mouth, unless you're some sort of elk
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.460]   or something where they can,
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:10.260]   presumably they have some sense of smell
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:11.580]   in their mouth as well.
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:13.840]   But humans generally smell with their nose.
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.280]   That wasn't terribly surprising,
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.460]   but there was a companion study that showed
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:21.140]   that the hippocampus, an area involved in encoding memories
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:25.460]   in one form or another, was more active, if you will,
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:28.620]   and memory and recall was better
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:31.060]   when people learned information while nasal breathing
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.300]   as opposed to mouth breathing.
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:36.500]   Does that make sense from any mechanistic perspective?
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:40.020]   - Well, given that there's a major pathway
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.980]   going from the olfactory system into the brain
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:49.480]   and you cut that, and not one from any receptors
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.060]   in the mouth, the degree of respiratory modulation
[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:56.540]   you're gonna see throughout the forebrain
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:01.380]   is gonna be less with mouth breathing than nose breathing.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:05.260]   So it's certainly plausible.
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:10.260]   I think there are a lot of experiments
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:19.160]   that need to be done to distinguish
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:23.480]   between the two that is the nasal component
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:25.180]   and the non-nasal component
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:27.720]   of these breathing-related signals.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.800]   There's a tendency sometimes when you have a strong effect
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:35.840]   to be exclusive, and I think what's going on here
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:39.440]   is that there are many inputs that can have an effect.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.920]   Now, whether they're parceled,
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.240]   that some affect this part of behavior
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:44.800]   and some affect that part of behavior
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.760]   remains to be investigated.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.760]   There's certainly a strong olfactory component.
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.240]   My interest is trying to follow the central component
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.880]   'cause we know that there's a strong central component
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:58.720]   in this.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.640]   In fact, there's a strong central projection
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.740]   to the olfactory bulb.
[01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:04.860]   So regardless of whether or not there's any
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.720]   effluent in and out of the nose,
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:09.720]   there's a respiratory input into the olfactory bulb,
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:13.040]   which combines with the respiratory modulated signals
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.280]   coming from the sensory receptors.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.280]   - Interesting.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:20.880]   And as long as we are poking around, forgive the pun,
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.880]   the nose, what about one nostril versus the other nostril?
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:28.700]   I know it sounds a little crazy to imagine,
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:32.120]   but there have been theories in yoga traditions and others
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:34.300]   that breathing through one nostril
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:37.500]   somehow activates certain brain centers,
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:40.040]   maybe hemispherically one side of the brain versus the other,
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:42.500]   or that right nostril and left nostril breathing
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:46.460]   might differ in terms of the levels of alertness
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:48.100]   or calmness they produce.
[01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:50.240]   I'm not aware of any mechanistic data on that,
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:54.360]   but if there's anything worthwhile about right nostril
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.660]   versus left nostril breathing that you're aware of,
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:57.520]   I'd love to know.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:00.540]   - Well, it's certainly plausible.
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:02.800]   I don't know of any data demonstrating it
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.800]   except the anecdotal reports.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.820]   As you know, the brain is highly lateralized
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:12.740]   and we have speech on one side
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:16.480]   and a dominant hand is on one side.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:20.300]   And so the notion that if you have this huge signal
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.840]   coming from the olfactory system
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:25.140]   and to some degree it's lateralized,
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:27.540]   it's not perfectly symmetrical, that is,
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:31.020]   one side is not going evenly to both sides,
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:35.560]   then you can imagine that once the signal gets distributed
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:39.380]   in a way that's not uniform,
[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:41.900]   that the effectiveness or the response
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:44.660]   is gonna be particular to the cortex
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.740]   in which either the signal still remains
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:50.620]   or the signal is removed from.
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:51.460]   - I see.
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:56.860]   What are some of the other features of our brain and body,
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:59.740]   be it blinking or eye movements
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:03.800]   or ability to encode sounds
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:08.380]   or any features of the way that we function
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:12.140]   and move and perceive things that are coordinated
[01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:15.080]   with breathing in some interesting way?
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:16.580]   - Thank you for that question.
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:19.780]   Almost everything.
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:24.340]   So we have, for example, on the autonomic side,
[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:26.860]   we have respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:30.220]   That is, during expiration, the heart slows down.
[01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:34.180]   Your pupils oscillate with the respiratory cycle.
[01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:37.660]   I don't know what the functional basis for that is,
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:40.020]   but they do oscillate with the respiratory cycle.
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:42.400]   - When we inhale, our pupils constrict, presumably,
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:44.520]   'cause there's an increase in heart rate
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.820]   and sympathetic tone, I would think of constriction.
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.360]   I'm guessing as you relax, the pupil will get,
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.200]   then you exhale- - I think you're right,
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:54.560]   but I always get the valence of that.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.680]   - Well, it's counterintuitive 'cause people wouldn't think
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.680]   that when the pupils get, I mean, it depends.
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:04.700]   I mean, you can get very alert and aroused for stress
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:08.180]   or for good reasons, and the pupils get wider,
[01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:09.640]   but your visual field narrows,
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.780]   and then the opposite is true.
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.920]   Anyway, I guess the idea is that the pupils
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:15.480]   are changing size, and therefore the aperture
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.760]   of your visual window is changing
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:19.700]   in coordination with breathing.
[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:24.700]   - Your fear response changes with the respiratory cycle.
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:26.560]   - Tell us more about that.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.320]   - Well, there's a paper by Zolano,
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.240]   which I think showed rather clearly
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:34.560]   that if you show individuals fearful faces,
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:43.920]   that their measured response of fearfulness
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:46.760]   changes between inspiration and expiration.
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:50.560]   You know, I don't know why, but it does.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.560]   Your reaction time changes.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:58.120]   So you talk about blinking,
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:02.040]   the reaction time changes between inspiration and expiration.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:04.920]   If I asked you to punch something,
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:08.560]   the time will change between inspiration and expiration.
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.500]   In fact, I don't know the degree
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.420]   to which martial artists exploit that.
[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:14.040]   You know, you watch the breathing pattern
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:18.200]   and your opponent will actually move slower
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.000]   during one cycle compared to the other.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.960]   - Meaning as they're, in which direction?
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.160]   If they're exhaling, they can punch faster.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:29.240]   - I have to say, I don't keep a table
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:31.440]   of which direction things move in,
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:34.640]   'cause I'm out of the martial arts field now.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:39.640]   - My vague understanding is that exhales on strikes
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.080]   is the more typical way to do that.
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:47.520]   And so as people strike, they exhale.
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:53.160]   - As you exhale, but there are other components
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:57.320]   to striking because you want to stiffen your rib cage,
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.740]   you want to make a valsalva maneuver.
[01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:02.400]   So that's, you know, both an inspiration and an expiration.
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:03.600]   It's at the same time.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.600]   So I don't know enough about when you say during expiration,
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.960]   I would assume that when you make your strike,
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:14.280]   you actually sort of want to stiffen here,
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.360]   which is a valsalva-like maneuver.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:17.960]   - And oftentimes they'll clench their fist
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.660]   at the last moment, because anyway,
[01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:22.800]   there's a whole set of motor things that we should,
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:24.320]   we can talk to some fighters.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.640]   We know people who know fighters, so we can ask them.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.000]   Interesting, what are some other things
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.760]   that are modulated by breathing?
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:37.240]   - You know, I think anything anyone looks at
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.740]   seems to have a breathing component
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:43.960]   because it's all over your brain.
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.080]   And it's hard to imagine it not being effective.
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:52.080]   Now, whether it's incidental or just background
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:57.800]   and doesn't really have any behavioral advantage is possible.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.000]   In other cases, it might have a behavioral advantage.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:06.000]   I mean, the big, this eye-opening thing for me,
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:10.640]   probably a decade ago, was digging into literature
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:15.640]   and seeing how much of cortical activity
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.400]   and subcortical activity had a respiratory
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:20.500]   modulated component to it.
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:24.760]   And I think a lot of my colleagues who are studying cortex
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:26.960]   are oblivious to this.
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:32.000]   And they find, I heard a talk the other day
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.720]   with a person we'll go on named,
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:36.680]   who find a lot of things correlated
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:39.640]   with a particular movement.
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:43.000]   And I think it all, when I looked, I said,
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.200]   "Gee, that's a list of things that are respiratory modulated."
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:48.360]   And rather than it being correlated
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:50.500]   to the movement they were looking at,
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:52.920]   I think the movement they were looking at
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:56.040]   was modulated by breathing, as was everything else.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:58.280]   So there wasn't that the movement itself
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:49:59.880]   was driving that correlation,
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:02.440]   it was that they were all correlated to something else,
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:04.080]   which is the breathing movement.
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:07.680]   And whether or not that is a behaviorally relevant
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:11.600]   or behaviorally something you can exploit, I don't know.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:15.000]   - I suspect you're right, that breathing is,
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.080]   if not the foundational driver of many,
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:20.120]   if not all of these things,
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:22.360]   that it's at least one of the foundational drivers.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.520]   - It's in the background, it's in the brain,
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:29.520]   and oscillations play an important part in brain function.
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:35.040]   And they vary in frequency from maybe 100 hertz
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:40.000]   down to, well, we can get to circadian
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.740]   and sort of monthly cycles.
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:47.740]   But breathing occupies a rather unusual place in all that,
[01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:51.480]   because, so let me talk about what people think
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:54.480]   the oscillations are doing, particularly the faster ones.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:59.140]   They're important in coordinating signals across neurons.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:03.480]   Just like in a computer, a computer steps.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.240]   So a computer knows when information is coming
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:08.160]   from another part of a computer,
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:11.880]   that it was originated at a particular time.
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:14.480]   And so that discrete step-by-step thing
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:16.000]   is important in computer control.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.280]   Now the brain is not a digital device,
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:19.960]   it's an analog device.
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:24.840]   But when I have a signal that coming in my ear and my eye,
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.840]   which is Andrew Huberman speaking,
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:30.360]   and I'm looking at his face, I see that as a whole,
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:33.000]   but the signal is coming into different parts of my brain,
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.760]   how do I unify that?
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:38.480]   Well, my neurons are very sensitive to changes
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:41.960]   in signals arriving by fractions of a millisecond.
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:44.960]   So how do I assure that those signals coming in
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:47.240]   represent the same signal?
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:50.680]   Well, if I have to have my brain in oscillation,
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:53.920]   and the signals ride on that oscillation,
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:55.880]   let's say the peak of the oscillation,
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:58.400]   I can then have a much better handle
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:00.400]   on the relative timing and say,
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:03.000]   those two signals came in at the same time,
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.880]   they may relate to the same object,
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:08.000]   and aha, I see you as one unified thing,
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.440]   spouting, you know, talking.
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:13.400]   And so these oscillations come
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:16.480]   in many different frequency ranges,
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.760]   and are important in memory formation
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:20.960]   and all sorts of things.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:23.120]   I don't think people pay much attention to breathing
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:27.080]   because it's relatively slow to this,
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:30.440]   the range when you think about milliseconds.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:33.520]   But we have important things
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:36.480]   that are thought to be important in cognitive function,
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:39.400]   which are a few cycles per second
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:42.480]   to 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second.
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:46.600]   Breathing in humans is maybe 0.2 cycles per second,
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:48.800]   every five seconds, although in rodents,
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:52.400]   they're up to four per second, which is pretty fast.
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:57.880]   So, but breathing has one thing which is special,
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:53:00.440]   that is, you can readily change it.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:03.080]   So the degree to which the brain is using
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:05.480]   that slow signal for anything,
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:09.920]   if that becomes part of its normal signal processing,
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:16.240]   you now change it, that signal processing has to change.
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:20.400]   And as that signal processing changes,
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.360]   acutely, there's a change.
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:26.440]   So, you asked about breath practice,
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.120]   how long do you have to do it?
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:31.760]   Well, a single breath will change your state.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:36.120]   You know, you're nervous, you take a deep breath,
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:39.560]   and it seems to help relax, so even a sigh.
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:43.560]   Call it what you will, call it what you will.
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:47.360]   It seems to work.
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:50.280]   Now, it doesn't have a permanent change,
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:52.000]   but you know, when I'm getting up to bat
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.600]   or getting up to the first tea or getting to give a big talk
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:58.680]   or coming to do a podcast, get a little bit anxious,
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:00.920]   a deep breath or a few deep breaths
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:05.120]   are tremendously effective in calming one down.
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:10.120]   And so, you can get a transient disruption,
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:12.400]   but on the other hand,
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:17.280]   let's take something like depression.
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:21.800]   I think you can envision depression
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.480]   as activity sort of going around in a circuit.
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:29.320]   And because it's continuous in the nervous system,
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:33.440]   as signals keep repeating, they tend to get stronger.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.480]   And then get so strong, you can't break them.
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.680]   So, you can imagine depression being something
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:44.040]   going on and on and on, and you can't break it.
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:46.440]   And so, we have trouble when we get
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:47.880]   to certain levels of depression.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.320]   I mean, all of us get depressed at some point,
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.640]   but if it's not continuous, it's not long lasting,
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:55.360]   we're able to break it.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:58.440]   But if it's long lasting and very deep, we can't break it.
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:00.800]   So, the question is, how do we break it?
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:03.320]   Well, there are extreme measures to break it.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:06.440]   We could do electroconvulsive shock.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.120]   We shock the whole brain.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:10.440]   That's disrupting activity in the whole brain.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:14.600]   And when the circuit starts to get back together again,
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:15.720]   it's been disruptive.
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:19.440]   And we know that the brain, when signals get disrupted
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:22.680]   a little bit, we can weaken the connections.
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:24.520]   And weakening the connections, if it's then
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:26.680]   in the circuit involved in depression,
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:27.880]   we may get some relief.
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:30.840]   And electroconvulsive shock does work
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:33.400]   for relieving many kinds of depression.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:34.680]   That's pretty heroic.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:39.920]   Focal deep brain stimulation does the same thing,
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:43.680]   but more localized or transcranial stimulation.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:45.480]   You're disrupting a network.
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:47.640]   And while it's getting back together,
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:49.640]   it may weaken some of the connections.
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:54.920]   If breathing is playing some role in this circuit,
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:56:00.840]   and now instead of doing like a one-second shock,
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:04.560]   I do 30 minutes of disruption by doing slow breathing
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.960]   or other breathing practice,
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:11.200]   those circuits begin to break down a little bit.
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:13.280]   And I get some relief.
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:16.720]   And if I continue to do it before the circuit
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:18.680]   can then build back up again,
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:20.760]   I gradually can wear that circuit down.
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:22.760]   I sort of liken this.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:25.800]   I tell people it's like walking around on a dirt path.
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:28.440]   You build a rut, the rut gets so deep,
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:29.520]   you can't get out of it.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:31.840]   And what breathing is doing is sort of filling in the rut
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:35.760]   bit by bit to the point that you can climb out of that rut.
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:40.400]   And that is because breathing, the breathing signal
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:45.160]   is playing some role in the way the circuit works.
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:47.080]   And then when you disrupt it,
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:49.720]   the circuit gets a little thrown off kilter.
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.320]   And as you know, when circuits get thrown off,
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:57.640]   the nervous system tries to adjust in some way or another.
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:01.080]   And it turns out at least for breathing,
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.480]   for some evolutionary reason or just by happenstance,
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:06.840]   it seems to improve our emotional function
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.520]   or our cognitive function.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:12.080]   And we're very fortunate that that's the case.
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:17.000]   - It's a terrific segue into what I want to ask you next.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.400]   And this is part of a set of questions
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:23.920]   I want to make sure we touch on before we wrap up,
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:27.800]   which is what do you do with all this knowledge
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:29.720]   in terms of a breathing practice?
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:33.080]   You mentioned that one breath can shift your brain state
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:35.000]   and that itself can be powerful.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.200]   I think that's absolutely true.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:40.080]   You've also talked about 30 minute breath work practices,
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:41.520]   which is 30 minutes of breath work
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:45.560]   is a pretty serious commitment, I think,
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:47.320]   but it's doable.
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:52.320]   Certainly a zero cost except for the time in most cases.
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:55.460]   What do you see out there in the landscape of breath work
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:58.160]   that's being done that you like?
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:57:59.840]   And why do you like it?
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:05.400]   What do you think or what would you like to see more of
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:08.200]   in terms of exploration of breath work?
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:09.160]   And what do you do?
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:16.120]   - Well, I'm a relatively new convert to breath work.
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:19.640]   Through my own investigation of it,
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:22.300]   I became convinced that it's real.
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:27.300]   And I'm basically a beginner in terms of my own practice.
[01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:32.000]   And I like to keep things simple.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000]   And I think I've discussed this before.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.540]   I liken it to someone who's a couch potato
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:39.760]   who's told they got to begin to exercise.
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:42.040]   You don't go out and run a marathon.
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.200]   So, you know, couch potato, you say,
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:46.960]   okay, get up and walk for five minutes and 10 minutes.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:49.860]   And then, okay, now you're walking for a longer period.
[01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:50.840]   You begin to run.
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:54.640]   And then you reach a point and say, well, gee,
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:57.000]   I'm interested in this sport.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.300]   And there may be particular kinds of practices
[01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:01.680]   that you can use that could be helpful
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:04.840]   in optimizing performance of that sport.
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:06.360]   I'm not there yet.
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:11.360]   I find I get tremendous benefit by relatively short periods
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:16.680]   between five and maybe 20 minutes of doing box breathing.
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:20.280]   It's very simple to do.
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:24.840]   I have a simple app, which helps me keep the timing.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:25.960]   - Do you recall which app it is?
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:27.540]   Is it the Apnea Trainer?
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:28.380]   Is that the one?
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:30.440]   - Well, I was using Calm for a long time,
[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:32.920]   but I let my subscription relapse
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:34.800]   and I have another one whose name I don't remember.
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:39.800]   But it's, so it's very simple and it works for me.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:45.280]   Now trying this Tummo because I'm just curious
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:47.880]   and exploring it because it may be acting
[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:48.720]   for a different way.
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:52.140]   And I want to see if I respond differently.
[01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:57.920]   So I don't have a particular point of view now.
[01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:01.100]   I have friends and colleagues who are into, you know,
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:03.600]   particular styles like Wim Hof.
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:06.080]   And I think what he's doing is great
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:08.720]   in getting people who are interested.
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:11.760]   I think the notion is that I would like
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:15.160]   to see more people exploring this.
[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:19.000]   And to some degree, as you point out, 30 minutes a day,
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:24.000]   some of the breath patterns that some of these styles
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.080]   like Wim Hof are a little intimidating to newbies.
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:31.560]   And so I would like to see something very simple
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:33.240]   that people, what I tell my friends is look,
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:34.680]   just try it five or 10 minutes.
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:37.120]   See if you feel better, do it for a few days.
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:40.080]   If you don't like it, stop it, it doesn't cost anything.
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:43.860]   And invariably they find that it's helpful.
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:47.560]   I will often interrupt my day
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:52.760]   to take five or 10 minutes.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:56.400]   Like if I find that I'm lagging, you know,
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:59.000]   there's a, I think there's some pretty good data
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.560]   that your performance after lunch declines.
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:06.240]   And so very often what I'll do after lunch,
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:08.640]   which I didn't do today is take five or 10 minutes
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:10.640]   and just sort of breath practice.
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:13.400]   - And lately, what does that breath practice look like?
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:15.440]   - It's just box breathing for five or 10 minutes.
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:18.340]   - And the duration of your inhales and holds and exhales
[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:20.260]   and holds is set by the app, is that right?
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:22.920]   - Well, I do five seconds.
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:25.720]   - So five seconds, inhale, five second hold,
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:28.000]   five second exhale, five second hold.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000]   - And sometimes I'll do doubles.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.000]   I'll do 10 seconds just because I get bored, you know,
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.680]   it's just, I feel like doing it.
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:42.440]   And it's very helpful.
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:47.000]   I mean, now that's not the only thing I do with respect
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.440]   to trying to maintain my sanity and my health.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.560]   - No, I can imagine there'll be a number of things.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.080]   Although you seem, because you seem very sane
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:57.120]   and very healthy, I in fact know that you are.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:58.120]   Both of those things.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:01:59.360]   - Well, you suspect that I am.
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:01.780]   - I suspect, but there's data.
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:07.080]   A while back, we had a conversation, a casual conversation,
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:08.960]   but you said something that really stuck in my mind,
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:13.960]   which is that it might be that the specific pattern
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:18.360]   of breath work that one does is not as important
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.020]   as experiencing transitions between states
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:25.640]   based on deliberate breath work or something to that extent,
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:29.040]   which I interpreted to mean that if I were to do
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:31.840]   box breathing with five second in, five second hold,
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:35.160]   five second exhale, five second hold for a couple of days,
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:36.400]   or maybe even a couple of minutes,
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:39.600]   and then switch to 10 seconds, or then switch to Tummo,
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:44.380]   that there's something powerful perhaps in the transitions
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:47.040]   and realizing the relationship between different patterns
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:48.280]   of breathing and those transitions.
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:52.840]   Much in the same way that you can get into one of these cars
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:55.000]   at an amusement park that just goes at a constant rate
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.080]   and then stops.
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:58.660]   Very different than learning how to shift gears.
[02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:01.120]   I used to drive a manual, I still can,
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:02.560]   so I'm thinking about a manual transmission,
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:04.240]   but even with an automatic transmission,
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:07.200]   you start to get a sense of how the vehicle behaves
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:08.800]   under different conditions.
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:11.280]   And I thought that was a beautiful seed
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.360]   for a potential breath work practice that,
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:16.020]   at least to my awareness, nobody has really formalized,
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:18.300]   which is that you introduce some variability
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:20.780]   within the practice that's somewhat random
[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:23.120]   in order to be able to sense the relationship
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:25.740]   between different speeds and depths of inhales, exhales,
[02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:27.040]   and holds, and so forth.
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:29.020]   And essentially it's like driving around the track,
[02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:31.880]   but with obstacles at different rates,
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:33.960]   and braking, and restarting, and things of that sort.
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:35.780]   That's how you learn how to drive.
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:37.200]   What do you think about that?
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:39.760]   And if you like it enough,
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:41.520]   can we call it the Feldman protocol?
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:42.360]   - Oh, please.
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:48.200]   I was asked in this BBC interview once,
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:50.800]   why didn't I name it the Feldman complex
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:52.280]   instead of the pre-butzinger complex?
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:54.080]   Because I already have a Feldman complex.
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.480]   - Well, it sounds like a psychiatric disorder,
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.480]   but I think the primary effect
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:06.280]   is this disruptive effect, which I described.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:11.280]   And, but the particular responses may clearly vary
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:14.620]   depending on what that disruption is.
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:18.560]   I don't know of any particular data
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:21.000]   which are some well-controlled experiments,
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.260]   which can actually work through
[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:25.580]   the different types of breathing patterns,
[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:29.840]   or simply with a box pattern, just varying the durations.
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:32.120]   I mean, Prayama is sort of similar,
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.160]   but the amount of time you spend
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:35.860]   going around the box is different.
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:38.820]   So I don't really have much to say about this.
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:42.120]   I mean, this is why we need
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.960]   better controlled experiments in humans.
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:49.000]   And I think this is where being able to study it in rodents,
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:54.000]   where you can have a wide range of perturbations
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:58.400]   while you're doing more invasive studies
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:01.640]   to really get down as to which regions are affected,
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:04.680]   how is the signal processing disrupted,
[02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:07.640]   which is still a hypothesis, but how it's disrupted,
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:12.320]   could tell us a lot about maybe there's a resonant point
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:14.280]   at which there's an optimal effect
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:17.200]   when you take a particular breathing practice.
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:21.040]   And then when we talked about the fact
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:23.040]   that different breathing practices
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.880]   could be affecting the outcome through different pathways.
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:30.040]   You have the olfactory pathway,
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:33.560]   you have a central pathway, you have a vagal pathway,
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:35.440]   you have a descending pathway,
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:40.400]   how different practices may change
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:43.040]   the summation of those things,
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:46.440]   because I think all those things are probably involved.
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:49.480]   And we're just beginning to scratch the surface.
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:54.480]   And I just hope that we can get serious neuroscientists
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:59.160]   and psychologists to do the right experiments
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:02.640]   to get at this, because I think there's a lot of value
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:05.240]   to human health here.
[02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:06.800]   - I do too, and it's one of the reasons
[02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:09.600]   my lab has shifted to these sorts of things in humans.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:11.640]   I'm delighted that you're continuing to do
[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:14.200]   the hardcore mechanistic work in mice
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:18.840]   and probably do work in humans as well if you're not already.
[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:21.320]   And there are other groups, Apple Lab at UCSF
[02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:23.560]   and a number of, I'm starting to see some papers out there
[02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:25.520]   about respiration in humans a little bit,
[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:26.840]   some more brain imaging.
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:32.920]   I can't help but ask about a somewhat unrelated topic,
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:36.480]   but it is important in light of this conversation
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:37.760]   because you're here.
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:40.520]   And one of the things that I really enjoy
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:44.280]   about conversations with you as it relates to health
[02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:47.120]   and neuroscience and so forth is that
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:51.120]   you're one of the few colleagues I have
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:56.120]   who openly admits to exploring supplementation.
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:07:00.000]   I'm a long time supplement fan.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.760]   I think there's power in compounds,
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:09.320]   both prescription, non-prescription, natural, synthesized.
[02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:11.480]   I don't use these haphazardly,
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:13.680]   but I think there's certainly power in them.
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:16.560]   And one of the places where you and I converge
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:18.240]   in terms of our interest in the nervous system
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:22.860]   and supplementation is vis-a-vis magnesium.
[02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:27.600]   Now I've talked endlessly on the podcast and elsewhere
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:29.900]   about magnesium for sake of sleep
[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:33.140]   and improving transitions to sleep and so forth,
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:37.640]   but you have a somewhat different interest in magnesium
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:39.480]   as it relates to cognitive function
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:41.880]   and durability of cognitive function.
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:43.440]   Would you mind just sharing with us a little bit
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:46.280]   about what that interest is, where it stems from,
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:49.720]   and because it's the Huberman Lab podcast
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:51.360]   and we often talk about supplementation,
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:54.720]   what you do with that information.
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:58.520]   - So I need to disclose that I am a scientific advisor
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:00.320]   to a company called Neurocentria,
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:04.360]   which my graduate student called Song Liu was CEO.
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:08.680]   So that said, I can give you some background.
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:11.480]   Guo Song, although when he was in my lab,
[02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:13.440]   worked on breathing, had a deep interest
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:15.680]   in learning and memory.
[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:17.960]   And when he left my lab, he went to work for it
[02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:21.500]   with a renowned learning and memory guy at Stanford,
[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:23.020]   Dick Chen.
[02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:26.280]   And when he finished there,
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:29.400]   he was hired by Susumu Tonogawa at MIT.
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:31.180]   - Who also knows a thing or two about memory.
[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:34.340]   I'm teasing, Susumu has a Nobel for his work
[02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:37.440]   on immunoglobulins, but then is a world-class
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:38.520]   memory researcher.
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:41.140]   - Yeah, and more.
[02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:43.460]   - He's many things.
[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:48.460]   - And Guo Song had very curious, very bright guy,
[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:53.560]   and he was interested in how signals between neurons
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:55.160]   get strengthened, which is called
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:58.080]   long-term potentiation or LTP.
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:03.080]   And one of the questions that arose was if I have
[02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:08.740]   inputs to a neuron and I get LTP, is the LTP bigger
[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:16.040]   if the signal is bigger or the noise is less?
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:19.220]   So we can imagine that when we're listening to something,
[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:21.160]   if it's louder, we can hear it better.
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:23.420]   Or if there's less noise, we can hear it better.
[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:26.280]   And he wanted to investigate this.
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:31.280]   So he did this in tissue culture of hippocampal neurons.
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:36.300]   And what he found was that if he lowered the background
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:41.680]   activity in all of the neurons, that the LTP he elicited
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:47.500]   got stronger, and the way he did that was increasing
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:50.600]   the level of magnesium in the bathing solution.
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:54.920]   This gets into some esoteric electrophysiology,
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:59.100]   but basically there's a background level of noise
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:03.780]   in all neurons, and that part of it is regulated
[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:07.700]   by the degree of magnesium in the extracellular bath.
[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:10.540]   - And you mean electrical noise.
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:12.860]   - Electrical noise, I'm sorry, electrical noise.
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:17.860]   And if you, in what's called the physiological range,
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:22.700]   which is between 0.8 and 1.2 millimolar,
[02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:24.180]   which don't worry about the number.
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:25.540]   - I can't believe I remember the millimolar
[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:26.860]   of the magnesium in the bath.
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:28.820]   - I'm always frightened that I get, you know,
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:31.500]   I say micro or femto or something,
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:33.500]   I go off by several orders of magnitude,
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:37.820]   but so in that physiological range,
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:40.780]   there's a big difference in the amount of noise
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:44.540]   in a neuron between 0.8 and 1.2 millimolar.
[02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:47.500]   So he played around with the magnesium,
[02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:50.700]   and he found out that when the magnesium was elevated,
[02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:52.700]   there was more LTP.
[02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:55.060]   All right, that's an observation in a tissue culture.
[02:10:55.060 --> 02:10:57.260]   - Right, and I should just mention that more LTP
[02:10:57.260 --> 02:11:00.180]   essentially translates to more neuroplasticity,
[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:03.580]   more rewiring of connections in essence.
[02:11:03.580 --> 02:11:08.580]   - So he tested this in mice
[02:11:08.580 --> 02:11:11.460]   and basically offered them a,
[02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:16.180]   he had control mice, which got a normal diet
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:18.780]   and one that had more than the rich magnesium
[02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:22.260]   and the ones that lived enriched with magnesium
[02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:25.820]   had higher cognitive function, lived longer,
[02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:29.100]   everything you'd want in some magic pill.
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:32.460]   Those mice did that, excuse me, rats.
[02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:38.380]   The problem was that you couldn't imagine
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:43.380]   taking this into humans because most magnesium salts
[02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:46.700]   don't passively get from the gut
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:49.020]   into the bloodstream into the brain.
[02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:52.660]   They pass via what's called a transporter.
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:56.100]   Transporter is something in a membrane that grabs
[02:11:56.100 --> 02:12:00.460]   a magnesium molecule or atom
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:02.980]   and pulls it into the other side.
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:06.100]   So if you imagine you have magnesium in your gut,
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:08.020]   you have transporters that pull the magnesium
[02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:10.260]   into the gut into the bloodstream.
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:14.300]   Well, if you had to take a normal magnesium supplement
[02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:16.580]   that you can buy at the pharmacy,
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:19.340]   it doesn't cross the gut very easily.
[02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:21.420]   And if you would take enough of it
[02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:26.060]   to get it in your bloodstream, you start getting diarrhea.
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:29.260]   So it's not a good way to go.
[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:30.460]   - Oh, it is a good way to go.
[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:32.420]   I couldn't help myself.
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:35.140]   - Well said.
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:41.300]   So he worked with this brilliant chemist, Fei Mao,
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:46.300]   and Fei looked at a whole range of magnesium compounds
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:52.660]   and he found the magnesium threonate was much more effective
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:56.980]   in crossing the gut blood barrier.
[02:12:56.980 --> 02:12:59.660]   Now, they didn't realize at the time,
[02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:03.500]   but threonate is a metabolite of vitamin C.
[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:05.740]   And there's lots of threonate in your body.
[02:13:05.740 --> 02:13:09.300]   So magnesium threonate would appear to be safe.
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:14.140]   And maybe a part of the role or now they believe
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:17.100]   it's part of the role of the threonate
[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:19.900]   is that it supercharges the transporter
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:21.020]   to get the magnesium in.
[02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:25.260]   And remember, you need a transporter at the gut,
[02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:27.140]   into the brain and into cells.
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:33.500]   So they gave magnesium threonate to mice who had...
[02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:37.140]   No, let me backtrack a bit.
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:40.260]   They did a study in humans.
[02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:43.940]   They hired a company to do a test.
[02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:46.140]   It was a hands-off test.
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:47.780]   It's one of these companies that gets hired
[02:13:47.780 --> 02:13:50.740]   by the big pharma to do their tests for them.
[02:13:50.740 --> 02:13:55.620]   And they got patients who were diagnosed
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:57.620]   as mild cognitive decline.
[02:13:57.620 --> 02:14:00.180]   These are people who had cognitive disorder,
[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:02.500]   which was age inappropriate.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:06.980]   And the metric that they use for determining
[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:11.700]   how far off they were is Spearman's G factor,
[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:16.660]   which is a generalized measure of intelligence
[02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:19.180]   that most psychologists accept.
[02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:25.820]   And the biological age of the subjects was,
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:31.300]   I think 51 and the cognitive age was 61
[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:32.860]   based on the Spearman G's test.
[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:35.900]   I should say the Spearman G factor
[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:40.060]   starts at a particular level in the population
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:44.420]   at age 20 and declines about 1% a year.
[02:14:44.420 --> 02:14:48.660]   So sorry to say, we're not 20 year olds anymore.
[02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:52.460]   But when you get a number from that,
[02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:53.820]   you can put on the curve and see
[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:56.100]   whether it's about your age or not.
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:58.340]   These people were about 10 years older
[02:14:58.340 --> 02:14:59.860]   according to that metric.
[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:06.060]   And long story short, after three months,
[02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:09.620]   this is a placebo-controlled double-blind study.
[02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:13.380]   The people who were in the placebo arm
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:18.140]   improved two years, which is common for human studies
[02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:19.540]   'cause of placebo effect.
[02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:23.620]   The people who got the compound
[02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:27.060]   improved eight years on average.
[02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:28.980]   And some improved more than eight years.
[02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:31.180]   They didn't do any further diagnosis
[02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:32.900]   as to what caused the mild cognitive decline.
[02:15:32.900 --> 02:15:36.140]   But it was pretty, it was extraordinarily impressive.
[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:38.500]   - So it moved their cognition closer to their biological age.
[02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:40.660]   - Biological age, biological age.
[02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:44.340]   - Do you recall what the dose is of magnesium threonate?
[02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:46.620]   - It's in the paper and it's basically
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:50.260]   what they have in the compound which is sold commercially.
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:53.240]   So the compound which is sold commercially
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:58.240]   is handled by a nutraceutical wholesaler
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:00.380]   who sells it to the retailers
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:02.940]   and they make whatever formulation they want.
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:09.680]   But it's a dosage which is,
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:12.560]   my understanding, is readily tolerable.
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:14.500]   I take half a dose.
[02:16:14.500 --> 02:16:17.480]   The reason I take half a dose is that I had
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:19.960]   my magnesium, blood magnesium measured
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:25.840]   and it was low normal for my age.
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:28.640]   I took half a dose, it became high normal.
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:31.380]   And I felt comfortable staying in the normal range.
[02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:36.860]   But a lot of people are taking the full dose.
[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:42.900]   And at my age, I'm not looking to get smarter.
[02:16:42.900 --> 02:16:46.320]   I'm looking to decline more slowly.
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:48.940]   And it's hard for me to tell you
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:50.620]   whether or not it's effective or not.
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:52.280]   - Well, you remembered the millimolar
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:54.460]   of the magnesium in the solution
[02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:55.880]   and on the high and low end.
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:59.840]   So I would say it's not a well-controlled study
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:00.940]   when it's an N of one,
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:04.240]   but it seems to be working.
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:06.760]   - When I've recommended it to my friends,
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:11.760]   academics who are not by nature skeptical, if not cynical,
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:14.400]   and I insist that they try it,
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:17.800]   they usually don't report a major change
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:19.160]   in their cognitive function.
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:20.860]   Although sometimes they do report,
[02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:23.240]   well, I feel a little bit more alert
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:25.980]   and my physical movements are better,
[02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:28.760]   but many of them report their sleep better.
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:30.780]   - And that makes sense.
[02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:33.400]   I think there's good evidence that three and eight
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:36.340]   can accelerate the transition into sleep
[02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:41.240]   and maybe even access to deeper modes of sleep
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:42.780]   for some people.
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:44.340]   For many people, actually,
[02:17:44.340 --> 02:17:46.320]   a small percentage of people who take three and eight,
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:50.220]   including one of our podcast staff here,
[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:52.540]   have stomach issues with it.
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:53.380]   They can't tolerate it.
[02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:54.960]   I would say just anecdotally,
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:57.640]   about 5% of people don't tolerate three and eight well.
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:17:59.340]   You stop taking and then they're fine.
[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:02.080]   It caused them diarrhea or something of that sort,
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:03.300]   but most people tolerate it well.
[02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:06.520]   And most people report that it vastly improves their sleep.
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:07.640]   And again, that's anecdotally.
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:10.680]   There are a few studies and they're more on the way,
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:13.000]   but that's very interesting because I,
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.400]   until you and I had the discussion about three and eight,
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:20.200]   I wasn't aware of the cognitive enhancing effects,
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:22.800]   but the story makes sense from a mechanistic perspective.
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:25.760]   And it brings you around to a bigger
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:27.080]   and more important statement,
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:32.080]   which is that I so appreciate your attention to mechanism.
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:35.960]   I guess this stems from your early training as a physicist
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:37.440]   and the desire to get numbers
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:40.880]   and to really parse things at a fine level.
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:43.520]   So we've covered a lot today.
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:45.280]   I know there's much more that we could cover.
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:48.560]   I'm going to insist on a part two at some point,
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:51.300]   but I really want to speak on behalf
[02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:53.500]   of a huge number of people and just thank you,
[02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:56.840]   not just for your time and energy and attention to detail
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:18:59.460]   and accuracy and clarity around this topic today,
[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:02.480]   but also what I should have said at the beginning,
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:03.500]   which is that, you know,
[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:06.120]   you really are a pioneer in this field
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:09.160]   of studying respiration and the mechanisms
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:11.400]   underlying respiration with modern tools
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:14.120]   for now for many decades, you know,
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:17.280]   and the field of neuroscience was one
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:20.360]   that was perfectly content to address issues
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:23.480]   like memory and vision and, you know,
[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:24.800]   sensation, perception, et cetera.
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:27.940]   But the respiratory system was largely overlooked
[02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:31.640]   for a long time and you've just been steadily clipping away
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:34.040]   and clipping away and much because of the events
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:39.040]   of related to COVID and a number of other things
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:41.240]   and this huge interest in breath work
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:43.440]   and brain states and wellness,
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:46.040]   the field of respiration and interest in respiration
[02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:47.600]   has just exploded.
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:52.080]   So I really want to extend a sincere thanks.
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:55.440]   It means a lot to me and I know to the audience
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:58.020]   of this podcast that someone with your depth and rigor
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:20:01.480]   in this area is both a scientist and a practitioner
[02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:03.840]   and that you would share this with us, so thank you.
[02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:05.420]   - Well, I want to thank you.
[02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:07.640]   This is actually a great opportunity for me.
[02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:11.560]   I've been isolated in my silo for a long time
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:15.660]   and it's been a wonderful experience to communicate
[02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:18.320]   to people outside the silo, have an interest in this
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:21.560]   and I think that there's a lot that remains to be done
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:24.880]   and I enjoy speaking to people who have interest in this.
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:28.600]   I find the interest to be quite mind boggling
[02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:31.840]   and it's quite wonderful that people are willing
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:36.840]   to listen to things that can be quite esoteric at times,
[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:41.540]   but it gets down to deep things about who we are
[02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:43.200]   and how we are going to live our lives.
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:44.860]   So I appreciate the opportunity
[02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:48.920]   and I would be delighted to come back at any time.
[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:50.720]   - Wonderful, we will absolutely do it.
[02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:51.820]   Thanks again, Jack.
[02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:53.320]   - Bye now.
[02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:55.200]   - Thank you for joining me for my conversation
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:56.740]   with Dr. Jack Feldman.
[02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:58.520]   I hope you found it as entertaining

[02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:38.980]   Some of that information covers information
[02:21:38.980 --> 02:21:40.160]   covered on the podcast.
[02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:42.480]   Some of that information is unique information
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:45.280]   and that includes science and science-based tools
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:47.040]   that you can apply in everyday life.
[02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:50.640]   During today's podcast and on many previous podcast episodes,
[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:51.960]   we talk about supplements.
[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:54.280]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:56.920]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them.
[02:21:56.920 --> 02:21:58.440]   One of the key issues with supplements,
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:21:59.800]   if you're going to take them,
[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:01.840]   is that they be of the utmost quality.
[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:03.520]   For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:06.600]   has partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:09.040]   Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality,
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:10.980]   both with respect to the quality
[02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:12.320]   of the ingredients themselves
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:14.660]   and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients.
[02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:15.500]   Why do I say that?
[02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:17.340]   Well, many supplement companies out there
[02:22:17.340 --> 02:22:20.540]   list amounts of particular substances on the bottle
[02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:21.620]   and when they've been tested,
[02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:25.020]   they do not match up to what's actually in those products.
[02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:27.860]   Thorne has the highest levels of stringency for quality
[02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:31.940]   and the particular amounts that are in each product.
[02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:33.460]   They partnered with the Mayo Clinic
[02:22:33.460 --> 02:22:34.540]   and all the major sports teams,
[02:22:34.540 --> 02:22:36.740]   so there's tremendous trust in Thorne products.
[02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:38.140]   That's why we partnered with them.
[02:22:38.140 --> 02:22:40.100]   If you're interested in seeing the supplements that I take,
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:43.940]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:46.140]   You can see the supplements that I take from Thorne.
[02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:48.100]   If you purchase any of those supplements there,
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:49.620]   you can get 20% off.
[02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:51.920]   And if you navigate further into the Thorne site
[02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:54.320]   to see the huge array of other products that they make,
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:57.260]   if you go in through thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:22:57.260 --> 02:22:59.460]   you'll also get 20% off any of the products
[02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:00.640]   that Thorne makes.
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:03.060]   I also want to just mention one more time,
[02:23:03.060 --> 02:23:04.140]   the program that I mentioned
[02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:05.300]   at the beginning of the episode,
[02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:06.800]   which is Our Breath Collective.
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:09.380]   The Our Breath Collective has an advisory board
[02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:11.460]   that includes people like Dr. Jack Feldman,
[02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:14.180]   where you can learn detailed breath work protocols.
[02:23:14.180 --> 02:23:16.420]   If you're interested in doing or teaching breath work,
[02:23:16.420 --> 02:23:18.140]   I highly recommend checking it out.
[02:23:18.140 --> 02:23:21.500]   You can find it at ourbreathcollective.com/huberman,
[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:24.360]   and that will give you $10 off your first month.
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:25.420]   So I want to thank you once again
[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:28.060]   for joining me for my conversation with Dr. Jack Feldman.
[02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:30.220]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:23:30.220 --> 02:23:31.980]   thank you for your interest in science.
