[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words found in Paul's epistle
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.680]   to the Romans in chapter 14, and reading the first four verses.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.680]   The first four verses in the fourteenth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:25.120]   "Him that is weak in the faith, receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.840]   For one believeth that he may eat all things, another who is weak eateth hers.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.980]   Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not, and let not him which eateth not judge
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.280]   him that eateth, for God hath received him.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.600]   Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.560]   To his own master he standeth or followeth.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.320]   Yea, he shall behold him up, for God is able to make him stand."
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.880]   Now, we began our consideration of this new section in the epistle to the Romans last
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.040]   Friday evening, and I pointed out that here the apostle, having dealt with our more general
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.800]   relationship to the principalities and powers, and having given us the two grand motives
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.840]   for Christian living in chapter 13, comes here now to a problem again that arises in
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.600]   the realm of the Church.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.680]   And the problem is, as we saw, the problem of things that are indifferent.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.840]   Now it is absolutely essential that we should be clear in our minds as to what that means.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.280]   He is dealing here with our attitude as Christian believers and as members of the Church.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.680]   New things which are not definitely prohibited in the New Testament.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.480]   That is why we call them things indifferent.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.400]   If a thing is prohibited, well, there is no need to discuss it.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.160]   There is no argument or disputation.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.800]   If it is prohibited, it is prohibited.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.320]   If it is commanded, it is commanded.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.440]   But there are things concerning which we have not got a clear commandment.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.680]   There is no definite prohibition.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.960]   So these are the things that are generally referred to as things indifferent.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.440]   And there are such things in connection with the Christian life.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.800]   And as we have seen, though these things are indifferent, they often lead to considerable
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   trouble.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.520]   They were obviously doing so in the Church of Rome.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.480]   Equally clearly they were doing so in the Church of Corinth, as that chapter which we
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.160]   read just now indicates so clearly.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.240]   So that is why the Apostle had to deal with them and that is why we have got to deal with
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.240]   them also.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.400]   These things are not essential to salvation.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.000]   But it is important that we should be right and clear in our thinking with respect to
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   them.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.600]   Now, we have seen that the Apostle works this out in terms of what he calls those who are
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.960]   weak in faith and those who are strong in faith.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.200]   He puts it here, "He that is weak in the faith receive he."
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.000]   In chapter 15, "We then that are strong," and he means strong in the faith.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.840]   Now, let's carry in our minds also that he is not talking about whether we have a strong
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.320]   or a weak faith.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.280]   What he is dealing with is the strength of our understanding of the faith, which is a
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.000]   very different thing.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.120]   It is the faith, not faith.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.480]   So what he is dealing with is our working out of the implications of our position as
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.880]   Christians and the teaching of the Christian gospel.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.560]   Now, this is most important.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.760]   That is why we spent a good deal of our time last Friday night in showing how it ever becomes
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.920]   possible that anybody can be weak in faith.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.040]   And we saw that there are many reasons for that.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.520]   Now then, the thing we have got to start off with this evening is the realization that
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.120]   there are these differences.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.720]   Some are strong in their understanding, some are not.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.040]   And that is where the difficulty comes in.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.840]   And the apostle now goes on to show us how we are to handle these matters, which belong,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.920]   as I say, to the realm of the working out or the application of our salvation in terms
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.340]   of daily, regular life and living.
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.240]   And this is how he deals with it.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.200]   Verse 1, as I showed in our general analysis last Friday night, verse 1 simply lays down
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   the general principle.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.400]   Then he will come to the particulars in the following verses.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.600]   And in verse 1, the first thing he tells us is this.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.840]   We have got to realize that we have a duty towards all our fellow members in the church.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.040]   The fact that some people may be weaker in the faith than we are, or may be weaker than
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.640]   we think we are, must not lead us to feel that we are independent of them, or that we
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.480]   are unconcerned about them, or that we cannot be bothered with them.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.920]   That is the very first thing that he obviously tells us here.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.480]   We have got to do something about them.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.200]   We cannot divorce ourselves from them.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.600]   Now I start with this for this reason, that it was quite clear that in the church at Corinth,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.500]   the church was divided partly in some such way as that.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.240]   And these brethren who said, and who felt that they had got knowledge and were puffed
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.000]   up by their knowledge, they were segregating themselves off into a little kind of select
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.360]   company with this advanced knowledge and understanding, and were not wasting their time with the other
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.360]   people.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.000]   Now that was actually the position in Corinth, and there are hints that it was similar in
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.120]   the church at Colossae, and in that whole group of churches round Colossae.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.120]   And this has certainly been the case many a time since then in the long history of the
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   Christian church.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.240]   So we start with this very broad statement.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.800]   It is always wrong to have factions, groups, divisions in terms of knowledge in the Christian
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.240]   church.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.560]   And whatever our position is, we must never feel that we are independent of others and
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.360]   unconcerned about them.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.560]   That is just the very beginning.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.120]   But then he puts a very definite negative.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.560]   Him that is weak in the faith, he says, will receive ye but not to doubtful disputations.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.120]   So we take the negative first.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.480]   We are not to receive him to doubtful disputations.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.480]   What is the meaning of this phrase?
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.140]   Well, there has been a great deal of argument about this.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.920]   So let us look at the words.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.400]   What is the meaning of the word 'disputation'?
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.800]   The real root meaning of this word, translated by the word 'disputation', is this.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   It is a word which describes a man thinking deliberately with himself about a given question.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.680]   It is in other words a term that covers a process of inward reasoning, or if you like
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.240]   a process of questioning.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.800]   We all do this, don't we?
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   We reason with ourselves.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.960]   You remember how Paul puts it in his address before Grepa and Festus.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.360]   I verily thought with myself.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.040]   That is the kind of thing.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   And we do that.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.380]   We are up against a problem and what you do is you have a discussion with yourself.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.760]   You deliberately do this.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.520]   And there is this process of inward reasoning and questioning with regard to this matter.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.840]   Now that is the root meaning of 'disputation'.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   Doubtful.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.240]   What is the meaning of that?
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:54.280]   Well originally it simply means that you have the power of distinguishing.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.600]   Distinguishing between right and wrong, between good and better, and best and so on.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.960]   It is a kind of process of discerning or of judging.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.720]   That is the real meaning of that word.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.960]   So there are some who say that this word should be translated like this.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:18.880]   'Him that is weak in the faith, but receive ye, but not to judgment of thoughts.'
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.720]   Here is this weaker brother with his thoughts.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.560]   He is in a bit of a perplexity.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:32.400]   Now you must not meet him with the purpose of judging his thoughts or sitting in judgment
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.040]   upon his opinions.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.560]   Now this brings us to the very essence of this matter.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.360]   This weaker brother, he is in trouble about these things.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.560]   And here he is, he has got these various points of view.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.480]   And he is thinking with himself and he is trying to arrive at a judgment.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.080]   And as a result of this his mind is somewhat agitated.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.080]   And he is troubled.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.920]   He has got a fearful spirit.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.040]   He is anxious to do the right thing and not to do the wrong thing.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.720]   But he has got doubts and hesitations.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.120]   And he really is in trouble.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.560]   Now that is the picture that we have got here.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:17.640]   And what the apostle is really saying is this, that the stronger brother must never aggravate
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.480]   that condition in which the weaker brother is.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.400]   Now I don't think this needs much explanation, does it?
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.840]   We are all familiar with people, indeed it may be true of us ourselves, who are almost
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.280]   perpetually in trouble about these things.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.120]   Should I do this or shouldn't I?
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.640]   Is this right for me or is it wrong?
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:44.320]   They have this kind of hypersensitive conscience, this almost morbid conscience, what I described
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.400]   as a kind of morbid scrupulosity.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.680]   And they are agitated about this.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.200]   They really are in trouble.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.360]   They want to do the right thing and they want to be right and they want to live as Christians.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.040]   But here they are in this condition.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.360]   And what the apostle is really saying here is this, don't aggravate that condition.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.520]   Now how can this be done?
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.640]   Well you can aggravate it like this.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.600]   You can aggravate their troubles and their condition simply by constantly raising this
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:23.160]   very thing that is agitating them and arguing with them about it.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.200]   You know, you are aware of the fact that they have got this trouble.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.760]   And there is a temptation that comes to you always to be fixing on this and saying, well
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.560]   now what about it?
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.480]   Are you still troubled and worried and perhaps you may do so jocularly?
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.240]   No, the apostle says you must not do that.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.040]   You must be always harping on this.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.120]   If you know it is a problem and a trouble, do it.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.640]   Well, don't be always raising it.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.520]   And don't give them the feeling that every time they meet you or come to your meetings
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.680]   that you will always be raising this problem because you are only going to end by making
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.960]   them still more agitated than they were at the beginning.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.720]   Another way you can make their condition worse is of course by ridiculing them, making fun
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.600]   of them, fancy being bothered about this.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.360]   But you see to them it is a very important and a very serious matter.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:16.640]   And though to you it isn't, if you just ridicule them, you are going to increase their troubles,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.960]   you are going to aggravate the agitation which they are already feeling.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.760]   And then the third way in which it can be done, and it is something that is done very
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:33.600]   commonly, and that is that you try to dragoon them, or try to feist your opinions upon them.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:40.040]   Now you are clear about this thing, and they are not, and the temptation is that you just
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:45.360]   sort of try and force them to see how wrong they are, and to bring them to your position.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.520]   You claim that you have got liberty and you feel that they are in bondage.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:55.320]   Now you mustn't, says Paul, you mustn't so deal with them that you are going to increase
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.960]   their problem rather than diminish it.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.520]   And if you try to bring force and pressure upon them, and to feist your clarity of understanding
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.600]   upon them, you will do them much more harm than good.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:16.800]   Now there is what is meant most essentially by this negative, not too doubtful disputations.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:23.440]   You mustn't sit in judgment on them, and you mustn't feist your opinions upon them.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:29.520]   Now it is important that we should be clear about this and safeguard this exposition from
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   being misunderstood.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.480]   It doesn't follow from what I have been saying that these matters should never be discussed
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.480]   at all.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.960]   Obviously it can't mean that for this reason, that if they are not discussed, these people
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.880]   can never be helped at all, and they must be helped.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.080]   So it is not a ban altogether.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:57.280]   What the apostle is really concerned about is the way in which we do try to help them.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.280]   That is what he is concerned about.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.360]   He doesn't clearly prohibit all teaching.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.080]   He does the exact opposite himself.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.600]   He does the exact opposite here, as he does it in other places.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.440]   So this is not a ban altogether, saying that now because a thing is difficult to some people
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.760]   you must never, never mention it and never deal with it.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.480]   No, there are people you know who adopt that attitude also.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.760]   There are people who do that not only with regard to matters like this, but with regard
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.520]   to other matters like prophetic interpretation, or the very doctrine of the Church, or of
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.560]   baptism, or something like that.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.720]   I have pointed this out before, that perhaps this has been one of the weaknesses of many
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.640]   movements and churches, evangelical movements and churches at this present time, that if
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:47.160]   they feel that a subject is going to upset anybody, they avoid it altogether.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.240]   There has been a very serious failure to consider the whole doctrine of the Church in interdenominational
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.400]   movements during this present century, for that very reason.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.760]   And that is surely wrong.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.640]   That is not what the apostle is saying.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.600]   What he is concerned about is the way in which we do this.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.200]   Very well then, there is our negative.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.000]   Not to sit in judgments upon his agitated thoughts and thinking.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.040]   Well, what are we to do?
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.320]   Well, the positive is, receive him.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.880]   As I say, not only don't ostracize him, or don't turn your back upon him, and don't
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:30.480]   be indifferent to him, but positively he says, you've got to receive him.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.240]   And the word that the apostle used is a word that goes even further than that.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.980]   It indicates how we should receive him.
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:44.760]   It carries the whole notion of giving him a cordial welcome, not a grudging one.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.920]   Not that you sort of say, well, of course, I've got to put up with this, but it's
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.280]   a nuisance and it's holding me back and so on, and it's an annoyance that I have
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.280]   to do this.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.760]   It's the exact opposite of that.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.920]   You don't grudgingly welcome him, and just put up with him.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:04.360]   Receive him, give him a cordial welcome, and show that you are really and deeply concerned
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.360]   about him.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.480]   Now, the apostle puts this, he lifts it up to a level, you see, which makes this thing
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.480]   quite clear.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.920]   Did you notice how he puts it in the third verse?
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.720]   Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not, and let not him which eateth not judge
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   him that eateth.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   Why not?
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.680]   For God hath received him.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.040]   God hath received him.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.760]   It's the very word that is used here in the first verse.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.440]   We are to receive this weaker brother in exactly the same way as God has already received him,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.640]   and we have received him, and we have been received by God also.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.680]   And again, he's so concerned about this that he says it in the seventh verse of the next
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   chapter.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:50.560]   Wherefore, receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.760]   Now, that is the way in which we've got to look at and to receive this brother who doesn't
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.880]   agree with us about these particular matters of indifference.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:07.720]   We have got to show him the same cordiality, the same love, the same delight in receiving
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:14.040]   him as the Lord has him and us, and all of us together.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.600]   So you see, he lifts it up at once into this marvelous and wonderful realm.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:24.760]   Well now, here is the apostle's general ruling.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:31.240]   And this first verse is going to cover everything that he's going to argue during the remainder
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:37.680]   of this chapter, and indeed as he sums it up at the beginning of the next chapter.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.880]   But already it seems to me that the apostle has indicated to us certain principles, certain
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.440]   general principles, which are of the greatest practical importance to all of us at the present
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.440]   time.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.880]   Now let me make it clear what I'm going to do.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:58.120]   I'm not going to give the apostle's final answer about these matters which are indifferent.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.760]   I can't do that because he doesn't do it himself until the end of the chapter.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.000]   He works his way through.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.240]   I must do the same.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.400]   But I'm saying that even already, before we come to that, in putting it like this in general
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:19.800]   in the first verse, he has shown us certain principles, which I think you will agree with
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:28.160]   me, are of the greatest possible importance for us in our conduct towards one another
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.400]   in the realm of the Church.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.440]   Now I want to emphasize that.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:38.560]   We are dealing with it in the realm of the Church primarily.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:45.440]   I say that because we are in a world in which we not only are involved in the Church, but
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.680]   we all know and are perhaps involved in, in supporting, or perhaps as members of, or perhaps
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:58.800]   active workers in, certain interdenominational activities, missionary societies, Christian
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.560]   unions, whether in business or a profession or among students or whatever it is.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:09.160]   Now I'm not at the moment dealing with what may be done in societies.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:15.560]   I am dealing only with what is said here by the Apostle in terms of our behavior in these
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.000]   matters in the realm of the Church.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.160]   And this, it seems to me, is the kind of principle which he lays down.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.160]   Here, at end of it, are the principles as I see them.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:39.120]   First, these indifferent matters are not central, and they do not determine whether we are Christian
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.120]   or not.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.440]   Now that's the most important principle.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.840]   Because you see, there are some people who would make these things central, and they
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.160]   would make them essential to our salvation.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:00.520]   And there are people who judge whether we are Christian or not by what we do with regard
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.560]   to these indifferent matters.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.920]   Now I gave you some hurried examples of this at the end last Friday night.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.160]   But I've known many Christian people who wouldn't hesitate to say that if they see a man smoking,
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.440]   that he's not a Christian.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.120]   Or if they see him doing something else.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:23.040]   They elevate these matters of indifference to a central, essential position.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.000]   Now the Apostle is clearly already telling us that that is not the case.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.360]   We are to receive these people.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:34.760]   So that means, well, whatever their views, and remember he deals not only with the weak
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.800]   but also with the strong, and he not only deals with the attitude of the strong towards
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.840]   the weak, but equally deals with the attitude of the weak towards the strong.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:49.720]   He deals with both sides, and this applies to all sides.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:54.640]   These matters, whatever else may be true about them, are not central, and they do not determine
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.320]   whether we are Christians or not.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:03.360]   Secondly, these matters, therefore, are not the grounds on which we admit to church membership
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.040]   either.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:11.840]   I have to say this because there are religious denominations, mainly in the United States
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:17.680]   of America, intending to come to this country, that definitely make these things conditions
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.080]   of church membership.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.280]   But my argument is that the Apostle, in the first verse, has told us that that is patently
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   wrong.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:32.160]   Whatever the point of view he says about these things, receive one another, regard one another
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.480]   as children together in the church of God.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:42.200]   These are not the conditions on which we are admitted to church membership.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.600]   The third point he therefore obviously suggests is that we must all always remember that at
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.040]   our best we are still imperfect.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:58.920]   As is thought elsewhere, we all are in some respect, every one of us, and I think I indicated
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.600]   again at the end last Friday night, how amazing it is how people are ready to condemn certain
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.480]   things which they see in others and are quite blind to things in themselves which those
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.280]   others condemn in them.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.800]   So we must always remember that we are all of us at best imperfect.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   These you see are general points which obviously are going to govern the whole of the detailed
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.640]   working out of this great argument.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.080]   So let me go on to a fourth point.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:34.680]   Our knowledge of the faith is never complete.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:40.600]   Now, I have to put it like that because the danger with the strong brother always is to
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:47.160]   think that he has encompassed all knowledge, that there is nothing further for him to learn.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:55.480]   So we've all got to remember that our understanding of the faith is never complete, it is never
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   perfect.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:03.480]   Now this is something that really is of very vital importance.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.880]   You remember how the apostle in writing in the fourth chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.240]   puts it like this, and this is very relevant to what we are now doing.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:19.000]   He talks about the ascended Christ having led captivity captive and gave gifts to men.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.200]   He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.200]   What for?
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.640]   Well for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:34.280]   of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.920]   of the Son of God and to a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.920]   of Christ.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.640]   Now you see what that means.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.240]   We have not all yet come to this unity of the faith.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:52.680]   Obviously he's not dealing there with saving faith, because we have already come to the
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.320]   knowledge of saving faith.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:01.200]   That is why we must hold on to this idea that the faith here does not mean saving or justifying
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.400]   faith.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:09.280]   It means the application of the whole truth of salvation to particular details, the outworking
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.280]   of it.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:16.040]   And here he indicates very clearly that this is something which is to go on and to increase
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:22.720]   and to develop until a great day will come when all Christians will see exactly the same
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.520]   with regard to all these questions.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.080]   We haven't arrived at that yet.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.960]   You see there are differences of opinion not only on these matters which are indifferent.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.160]   There are differences of opinion, as I was indicating, upon matters of prophecy, matters
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:43.280]   of baptism and so on, and if we make any one of those vital to salvation or to church membership,
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.000]   we are violating the apostles' principle.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   We mustn't do that.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.960]   There will be a day when we'll all see these things absolutely clearly.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.400]   It hasn't arrived obviously, but we are pressing on in this respect.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.680]   Or take another statement of it which is perhaps still clever.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:07.040]   The second epistle of Peter in the first chapter and beginning at the first verse, having reminded
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:14.360]   these men and these people that God has already provided for us all things that pertain unto
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.000]   life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:27.080]   He goes on to say this, "Beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.760]   to virtue knowledge."
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.200]   Now this is the very thing with which we are dealing.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.240]   You see, you've already got the faith.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.280]   You can't be a Christian without it.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.880]   You've got justifying, saving faith.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.960]   You have seen the way of salvation.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.120]   You have believed it.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.840]   You have committed yourself to it.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.840]   You've got knowledge there.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.760]   But says Paul, "Add to your faith."
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.360]   And what you've got to add to your faith amongst other things is knowledge.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.960]   And you've got to give diligence to add knowledge to your faith.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   Now, you see, I emphasize this in order to show this, that if we imagine that we, all
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:13.600]   of us, are in exactly the same position with regard to our knowledge of the faith, well,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:19.120]   it means that there is something radically wrong with our knowledge of the faith.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:25.600]   The scripture teaches us that there are people at different levels in their attainment of
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.360]   knowledge with regard to this faith.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.320]   Some have added a little, some have added more, some have added more.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:38.880]   You go on with all diligence adding to your faith this knowledge.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.640]   And this is something, of course, that explains why we've got these New Testament epistles.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.520]   That's what they're for.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.600]   We meet here together on Friday nights to add knowledge to the faith that we've already
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.160]   got, and the faith that we understand.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.440]   But our understanding is incomplete.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:00.000]   So we've all got to come now, being ready to learn and to go on, the weak brother and
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.800]   the strong brother.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:07.120]   The apostle is laying this down as a general principle covering the entire matter of how
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.720]   we are to handle and to regard these matters that are indifferent.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.520]   Now, this is a very important point, isn't it?
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.440]   None of us have arrived.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.120]   None of us have got perfect or complete knowledge.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:26.720]   We must all go on adding to our knowledge and giving great diligence to do so.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:33.080]   So then I come to the fifth principle which really covers them all, which is this.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:40.040]   We must remember that we are members of the same family, the family of God, and we are
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.400]   to help one another as members of the family.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:51.080]   What would you think of the members of a family in which there may happen to be a child that
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.960]   is not quite as developed as the remainder of the family?
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.480]   What would you think of the members of a family fully developed who despise or ignore or neglect
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.680]   this slightly defective child, which is as much a child of the family as they are?
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   "No, no," says the apostle.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.440]   You've got to realize that you're all one, you've all been received by the same Christ
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.200]   and the same God, and you've got to love one another, and your greatest concern of
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.400]   all should be to help one another.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.160]   Now, that's the great principle that he's laying down.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.360]   And that leads to the next matter that I want to discuss with you.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:33.120]   There are those who would say that all the apostle is saying in the first verse is this,
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:40.680]   that the strong brother must never sit in judgment on the scrutinies of the weaker brother,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.200]   and that he's saying, "No more."
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.280]   I don't agree with that.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.440]   He is saying that.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:53.160]   But as he goes on to show very clearly, the apostle is not only dealing with the strong
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.760]   brother, he is also dealing with the weaker brother.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.880]   And he's got things to say to the weak brother exactly as he says to the strong brother.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:09.320]   I take the view that the apostle here is instructing the strong and the weak, for they both fall
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:15.720]   into error at this point, as he will show us over this matter of meats.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:22.120]   So that I am here to defend the translation of our authorized translators.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:29.320]   "Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations."
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:35.800]   It isn't only not to express judgment upon the weak brother's scrutiny.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:42.200]   He really is concerned about the whole question of the discussion of these matters.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.720]   That was clearly the view taken by the authorized translators.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.960]   And I am here to assert that this is involved, as is the other thing as well.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.200]   I don't stop at the other.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:57.040]   I accept the other, I start with it, but I say that also he does really raise here in
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:03.080]   principle this whole question of the place of discussions in the Christian life, and
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.160]   especially the discussion of these matters that are indifferent.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:17.840]   Now then, what are the rules about discussions amongst Christians in the life of the Church?
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.800]   I am going to give you what I understand to be the general teaching of the whole of the
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.400]   New Testament on this matter, summarized, as I feel, in this one big injunction of the
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.400]   apostle.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   Receive them, receive them with cordiality, receive them as brethren, receive them with
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.680]   grace, but not to doubtful disputations.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:44.240]   So I would indicate that there are certain rules that we must always bear in mind with
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:51.160]   regard to the discussions of any subject, any question, in the realm of the Church.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.160]   And here are the rules.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.600]   Never have a discussion for the sake of a discussion.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.320]   Now the world does that, doesn't it?
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:09.200]   The world enjoys having a debate, as is debating societies, for the sake of having a debate.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.760]   This must never be done in the realm of the Church.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.000]   We are not in the world, we are out of the world.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And to have a discussion merely for its own sake, for the sake of a discussion, is something
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.320]   that seems to me to be entirely foreign to the whole of the New Testament attitude.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.840]   Secondly it follows, obviously, you must never have a discussion for the sake of entertainment
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.120]   or for the sake of pleasure.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.040]   You may say these injunctions are unnecessary.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.760]   I can assure you they are not.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:44.540]   And as one who in the past has been very guilty in this very matter, I find this second injunction
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.080]   of mine to be most important.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.440]   You know there are some people to whom there is no greater form of entertainment than having
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.920]   a discussion about religion.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.600]   It is one of the most interesting, fascinating things that a man can ever do or ever be engaged
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   in.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.040]   There have been famous disputations in the past history of the Church, and they have
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.840]   often been nothing but entertainment.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.240]   And we must always be very careful that we exclude this.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.840]   We never enter into a discussion about anything in connection with the Christian life merely
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.440]   for entertainment or for pleasure.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:23.160]   Third, never enter into a discussion for the sake of display of yourself.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.520]   You know there are some people who are fond of hearing their own voices, aren't there?
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.000]   You mustn't in the realm of the Church.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   People like to talk.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.080]   There are some people who are always itching to speak and to voice their opinions because
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.400]   they like to hear their own voices.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.000]   It's quite foreign to the whole atmosphere of the New Testament, or to display their
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.920]   knowledge, or to display their cleverness, or to display their opinions or their skill
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.920]   in argument and in disputation.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.600]   Don't forget what I was indicating last Friday evening.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:03.000]   Though you're born again, you've still got your old temperament, remember?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.520]   There is something every one of us has got to watch, and every one of us has got to fight
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.520]   in particular.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.760]   What I'm saying tonight doesn't apply to some of you at all.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.960]   As natural men and women, you hated discussions always.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.620]   You never had an argument even about politics with anybody.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.400]   You walk out when a discussion starts.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.520]   All right, but you see, you've got something special that troubles you.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.000]   I'm dealing now with this whole question of discussion.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.720]   And though we are born again, unless we are very careful, the moment we begin to discuss
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   these things, the old nature begins to assert itself, and this is one of the ways in which
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.960]   it does it.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.560]   So I put it like that, never for display of self.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:48.480]   My fourth injunction, never discuss these matters in a bad tempered or an uncontrolled
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   manner.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.520]   Now this is most important.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.320]   I've seen people lose their tempers over discussion of religious questions, Christian questions,
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.960]   matters such as this.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:09.080]   I've always got a picture in my mind of this, brought up as I was in Wales where everybody
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.960]   went to Sunday school.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.040]   Not only the children, everybody went to Sunday school.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.400]   I belonged to a Sunday school in which there was a class for men of a century and another
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.400]   for women of a century.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.400]   Everybody went to Sunday school.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.440]   And at the end of the Sunday school, every Sunday, there was a general kind of catechizing
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.440]   meeting.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.440]   All the classes came together and one man was appointed to put questions.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.040]   And he would, somebody would give an opinion, then he'd say, "Everybody agree with this."
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   Somebody else would give another.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:40.160]   I always remember the picture of a Sunday school ending on one occasion with three men
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:46.040]   on their feet speaking together at the same time, each of them having lost his temper.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.600]   That's the sort of thing I'm saying should never happen.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:54.360]   Because for this reason, the moment you've lost your temper in a discussion, well the
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.200]   important thing for you is not the question at issue any longer, it's the fact that you've
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.600]   lost your temper.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.760]   Whatever the right or the wrong of this matter may be, you are patently in the wrong because
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   you can't control yourself.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.880]   And a Christian who can't control himself should not give his opinion on anything.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:15.040]   The first thing he's got to learn, or she's got to learn, is self-control.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.800]   And then and then only are you entitled to go on to discuss these questions.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.240]   So there must never be bad temper.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.560]   Now this needs to be said in the church, doesn't it?
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:30.040]   You remember what Spurgeon used to say, he used to warn the students, he kept on saying
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.120]   it, he'd say, "Now you'll find this when you go out into churches."
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.760]   He said, "You will find that there are people in your churches who in a prayer meeting pray
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.760]   like angels.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.520]   But the moment you go to a church meeting and discuss some of the affairs of the church,
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.960]   you'll find the same people suddenly become devils."
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.040]   And it's very true, isn't it?
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.920]   Think of the quarrels in churches which have done such harm to the Christian cause.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:00.520]   It's all because they've never known and never learned truly how to discuss these matters
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.520]   together.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.840]   Very well, let me take up a point like this.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:11.120]   We must learn, I say in the fifth place, always to draw a distinction between a discussion
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.680]   and an argument.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.880]   Now I'm saying that discussions are essential.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:21.400]   They're a good way of teaching, as long as we are careful in these respects.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:26.080]   What's the difference between a discussion and an argument?
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.720]   Well there is a word which is being used very much at the present time, I confess I don't
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.040]   like it because I think it tends to confuse issues.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.320]   It's this word, "dialogue."
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.040]   It's the favorite word of the ecumenical people of the present time.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.760]   And what they mean by dialogue is this.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.240]   They say, "You mustn't have the old wranglings we used to have.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.920]   But you must come and exchange opinions and try to see the other man's point of view."
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.440]   Well now, that's all right.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.040]   That is exactly what I think the apostle is saying here, is the thing we should practice.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:01.160]   But where our friends of the ecumenical movement, of course, go so wrong is this.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:06.000]   That they do that with Roman Catholics, for instance.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.920]   Or they will do that with people who deny the very elements of the Christian faith.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.840]   To which my reply is this.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:18.360]   You must not and you cannot have a dialogue with people who either deny the faith altogether
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.480]   or so add to it that they deny it.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.880]   You don't have a dialogue with them.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.840]   A dialogue means, as we have here, that there is something in common.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.420]   That you're all Christians together.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.660]   But you mustn't regard as a Christian a man who denies the very elements of the Christian
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.660]   faith.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:38.480]   Or a man who says that you must go through the Virgin Mary or the saints, or that you
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   are saved by baptism or something like that.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.960]   Now there is no basis there.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:48.960]   A discussion, a dialogue, presumes a common basis, a common condition.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.560]   And what the apostle is saying is this.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.120]   As you have all been received together by the Lord, as you are all Christians and fellow
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:01.000]   members and of the same family, well, now then, on that basis, look at these questions
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.560]   in this kind of way.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:07.480]   This is the difference then between a discussion and an argument.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.320]   And the essential difference is this.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.000]   If you're in an argument, of course, you're generally just out of wind and to prove that
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.320]   you are right.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.760]   That's why argumentation is generally bad.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:26.080]   It's not much use anywhere, but it's very bad in the realm of the Christian church.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.960]   You mustn't be concerned simply to win an argument or to prove that you are right.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.760]   You mustn't be concerned solely to defend your own position and to beat others or to
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.760]   beat them down.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.760]   Why not?
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:42.480]   Well, because that always has the effect of antagonizing the other.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.760]   That's the trouble with an argument.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.920]   You are more certain of your position at the end, but so is the other person.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:54.360]   You've hardened his position, you have antagonized him, and you've probably made him more obstinate.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.440]   He sees that you are trying to put him down, and that makes him determined to defend his
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.720]   position at all costs.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.520]   And so any agreement is already ruled out.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.200]   The spirit on both sides is wrong.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.760]   And an argument always does more harm than good.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:18.760]   So let's be clear about the difference between a discussion and an argument.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.640]   So I would put my sixth rule in this form.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:32.720]   The desire always of all of us should be to know the truth better and to help one another.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:38.800]   Now those of you who read Robert Haldane in his commentary on the epistle to the Romans
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:46.200]   will notice that he virtually says that discussion never does any good at all, and that nobody
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.440]   has ever been persuaded by a discussion.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.880]   I think he goes much too far.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:57.040]   I am asserting that there is a real place for discussion on condition that we observe
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:02.920]   these rules, on condition that the discussion is handled carefully, on condition that it
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:09.320]   is carried on in a spiritual and in a Christian manner.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:15.240]   I think that this method of discussion, the so-called Socratic method, has justified itself
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.200]   throughout the centuries.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.240]   But of course it has its dangers.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.480]   Everything has its dangers.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.940]   Preaching has its dangers.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.120]   Teaching has its dangers.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   And discussions have their dangers.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.560]   And if a discussion cannot be carried out properly, or if it tends to degenerate always
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.480]   into an argument, don't do it at all.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:38.760]   But I think it is going much too far to rule it out altogether and to say that a discussion
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.560]   is never of any value.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.080]   Well, what then?
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.360]   How do we handle a discussion?
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:53.440]   The conclusion I come to is this one, that what the apostle is really telling us here
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:58.920]   is this, that we've got to learn the art of teaching, all of us.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.920]   We are to teach one another.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.120]   We are to help one another.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:08.520]   And the first thing he says you've got to do is to learn what is the essence of the
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.520]   art of teaching.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.760]   And oh, how we all need this.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:21.800]   I sometimes think that this is the thing that is needed above everything else by young pastors.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:29.720]   I've seen excellent young men get into trouble in churches so often because they've never
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.200]   understood this point.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:38.220]   Their motives have been excellent and what they wanted to do was right, but their way
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:45.180]   of doing it has been so wrong and has so forgotten all that the apostle teaches here, that instead
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:49.520]   of teaching their people, they've divided their churches and sometimes have even had
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.120]   to leave their churches.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.880]   Now, but this isn't only confined to pastors.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.960]   I've often come up against this problem in this way.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:03.680]   Some of you tonight, you're listening to me, may have been involved in this very thing.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:10.760]   I've often met this problem in the case of young Christian people getting married and
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:17.360]   especially those who have been converted out of an irreligious or perhaps even a godless
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.360]   family.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.080]   Now the problem has often arisen in this way.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:25.320]   They come to me and the arrangements are being made for the wedding and for the reception
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.040]   afterwards.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.040]   And they're in trouble and the trouble is this.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.920]   The bride says, "Well, my people are not Christians."
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:40.880]   And they're very anxious to have wine or something at the wedding reception.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.320]   And the young couple have decided that they're not going to do this, that this is absolutely
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.840]   wrong, that they're Christians, they can't have this.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.720]   And they're determined to stand on this and to bear their witness.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.720]   Their motives are excellent.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.400]   Whether I shock you or not, I don't know.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.800]   But I have always told them that they mustn't do that.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.240]   And that they mustn't do that for several reasons.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.640]   One is that it isn't their reception, it is the reception given by the parents of the
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   bride.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:16.480]   Secondly, that if they really do want to influence these unbelieving parents to Christianity,
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.200]   well then they must not behave as they're proposing to do.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.640]   It's not their responsibility, they are not doing anything wrong, and they will certainly
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:28.920]   end by giving a completely false impression of the Christian faith to these unbelieving
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.280]   parents and the unbelieving guests who are going to attend.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.960]   Now then, very well, bear that in your mind.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.520]   The position of the young pastor is often this.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.680]   He's going to a church where they may have had bazaars or something, and he doesn't believe
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.680]   in bazaars.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.080]   And he takes a stand on this.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:50.400]   Or not only bazaars, but various other things that unfortunately happen in churches at the
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.400]   present time.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.520]   Now then, what is the rule, what is the essence of the art of teaching?
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.760]   Well I think it's something like this.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.880]   One, it is the business of the teacher always to realize the position of those who are being
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.200]   taught.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:10.000]   The first thing a teacher has got to do is to make an assessment of the people he's teaching,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.560]   whether it be children or whether it be adults, doesn't matter.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:18.840]   The good teacher doesn't just come out of his study with his lesson all prepared and
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.680]   underlined and double underlining and just give it to them.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.760]   If he does, he's not fit to teach.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:31.280]   The first thing the teacher's got to do is to understand those whom he's going to teach,
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.200]   and to learn how to assess them.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:42.520]   Secondly, he must learn not to expect too much from children and babes.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:47.200]   You see, if you expect too much from a child, you can be very cruel to that child.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.960]   What do you think of the sort of teacher who canes a child because it can't follow something
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.960]   that's been said?
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.640]   You'd agree he's not fit to teach.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.480]   But you know, many people do this with adults.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.440]   They're babes in Christ, they're weak in the faith, they don't understand.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:06.760]   And yet these impatient teachers, they dragoon them, they slash them, they denounce them,
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.120]   and they antagonize them.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.120]   Why?
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:14.080]   Well because they've never taken the trouble to realize the position of these people.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   Now I could give you personal stories about this.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:23.920]   The first church of which I was the minister was the kind of church I'm describing.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.840]   And the first thing I saw was that these people were ignorant, I mean ignorant spiritually,
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   of these matters.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.080]   They'd never been taught about this.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   Not at all.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.320]   It wasn't so much that they were deliberately wrong, as that they'd never really been made
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.640]   to face things.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:43.280]   Very well, if you start with a child, remember that he's a child, if you start with a child
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.600]   in the faith, remember that he's a child.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.880]   Don't expect full understanding from children.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.880]   If you do, you're a thoroughly bad teacher.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.120]   And don't be cruel, therefore, to people.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.480]   Don't expect from them what they've never been in a position to be or to have.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.280]   So the third great thing is the need of patience.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.440]   The teacher must always be very patient.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.640]   You must be ready to answer questions.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.080]   You must be ready to repeat yourself.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.760]   You must be ready to face difficulties.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.560]   Of course, you'll find this as a teacher, that some of the clever people feel you're
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.560]   wasting time.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.560]   They know that already.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.800]   Fancy going over that again, they say.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.800]   You've got to ignore them.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.840]   Or not only ignore them, you know how to deal with them too.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:31.840]   You can do something with them in passing now and again, and just show them their conceit,
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.280]   and that they don't always know quite as much as they can.
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.680]   But they'll be most impatient with you, take no notice.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.840]   You be patient.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.960]   Be patient with the people who are struggling along, with the children in the faith.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.200]   Deal with their questions, answer them patiently.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.020]   Be prepared to demonstrate to them out of the scriptures.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:54.040]   What the teacher must never do is just to stand up and say, "I say, I am saying."
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.040]   No, no.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.480]   You've got to demonstrate it, you've got to show it.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.400]   You've got to take your scriptures, you've got to consider the possibilities, and you've
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.160]   got to work it out.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.720]   And it needs great patience.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:11.120]   There is no quality in a teacher that is needed more than this, the quality of patience.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.640]   And then fourthly, never forget to appreciate the value of example.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.080]   Alden rightly emphasizes this.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.560]   You see, what you and I must do is this.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.600]   Now here is a man who's in genuine difficulty about something.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.480]   Very well, we think he's wrong, we think we are right.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   Show that to him.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   Show it in your life.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.600]   Show it by your example.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.760]   Show him a better way.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.680]   Now this is where it's often come in with young pastors.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.680]   They start by going down this law.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:43.200]   Now I've always said to such a thing I had to learn for myself.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.280]   Remembering that these people don't know any better.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.720]   Don't sort of lay down the law too much, but reason with them.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.120]   Say, "Now look here.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.000]   Are you prepared to try another way?
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.400]   Are you prepared to give another way an opportunity?"
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.000]   And they'll generally be led by you.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.120]   You can reason with them and you show that you're a reasonable person and that you're
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.120]   patient.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.720]   And just say, "Well, let's try another way.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.720]   Let me show it to you."
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.720]   You give your reasons, you give your explanations, and they're generally amazed.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.560]   They've never thought of this and they're prepared to give it a trial.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.120]   And you show in trial.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:20.480]   So often have I known this happen, where a young minister has had to do this over a question
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.480]   like a bazaar and he said, "Now let's try just for once.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.680]   Let us ask the people to come and bring their gifts."
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.200]   And the people have accepted it and they've had perhaps twice or three times what they've
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.400]   ever had out of their wretched bazaars.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.280]   But that's the way to do it.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:38.880]   Not to stand as it were on your hind legs and just lay down the law and denounce.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.880]   No, no.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.560]   You've got to show people.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.920]   You don't make people do things without understanding why they're doing them.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:52.960]   You must give them the reasons and you must lead them by your example and by your instruction.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:48:01.040]   So above all, and with this I close, the essence of teaching is that you show and manifest
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:06.200]   a loving interest in those whom you're teaching.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:11.000]   Once they get the impression that what you are really concerned about is to help them
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.360]   and not to denounce them and not to despise them, the moment they feel that you love them,
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.800]   that you're concerned about them, that you want to help them, that'll do infinitely more
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.200]   than all your demonstrations and arguments.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.320]   I'm not ruling out the arguments and demonstrations.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.680]   I say they're essential.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:35.280]   But if they're not done in the spirit of a loving concern, it's useless.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.720]   But you know, once these people feel that you have got this loving concern, they will
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.600]   listen to you.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.160]   And then you will be able to help them.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:51.800]   And together you will be able to arrive at a common opinion with regard to these matters
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.200]   that are indifferent and many other matters.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.080]   Very well, there it is as I see it.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:03.320]   And the apostle here, I remember, is dealing only with conduct in the realm of the Church.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:09.920]   As members together, those who have been received by the same Christ and the same God, we are
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.320]   to receive one another in this same way and help one another.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:20.080]   And now we are in a position to go on to consider his detailed application of this general,
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:27.400]   overarching, covering principle, which deals not only with these matters but any matter
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.360]   that we may have to discuss in the realm of the Christian Church.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.920]   Let us pray.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:40.560]   O Lord, our God, we come to Thee again and we do thank Thee for Thy Word.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:46.360]   O Lord, we realize how lost and bereft we would be without it.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:53.400]   We see our proneness to wander astray and to think and do that which is wrong.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:57.800]   We humbly thank Thee for all that Thou hast provided for us.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:04.280]   O God, God, we pray Thee to deal with us above all, shed Thy love abroad in our hearts by
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:12.160]   Thy Holy Spirit and give us a burning love for one another and a desire to help and to
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.280]   build up one another in this, our most holy faith.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:22.000]   Use us, O God, all of us, more and more to that great and glorious end.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.640]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:34.320]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:41.480]   of this, our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.880]   Amen.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.800]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
