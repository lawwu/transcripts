[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   The friend ship recession.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.860]   Are we in a friend ship recession?
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.420]   If so, is it a problem?
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.440]   And if it's a problem, what's the right way to solve it?
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.100]   What's the right way to build from scratch a robust series
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.120]   of friendships in your life?
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.560]   This seems really tightly connected to our broader vision and living a
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.460]   deeper life in a distracted world, especially in a world where we have
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240]   these social apps and text messaging tools that give us the illusion
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.400]   of being connected to people.
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.860]   But don't trick our brain into thinking that we're actually being social.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.160]   Real friends matter now than they ever have before.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.960]   So in order to talk about this, I'm going to bring on a special guest.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.960]   That's a long time, a friend of mine and a long time friend of the show.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.160]   It's a comedian and podcaster, Jamie Kilstein.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.960]   I'm bringing him on because he recently went through a process of building up.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.680]   A robust group of male friendships in his forties.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.640]   So I figured he would have a lot to teach us about what worked and what didn't.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.100]   So let's get Jamie on the line now to talk about the friendship recession.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.580]   Jamie, I brought you on because, you know, we were actually just
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.500]   talking about this topic offline and I was thinking, wait a second, save it.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.700]   Let's do this in public because I guess that's what we do these days.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.820]   Everything is in public.
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.640]   So anyways, thanks for coming on and helping me figure out this topic.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.880]   Now, is that term though, friendship recession, is that one you had heard,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.780]   or is that just us being geeky?
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.800]   Yeah, I was going to say, I haven't heard it because I have friends that I'm
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.700]   hanging out with and not reading your dorky newspapers.
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.460]   Uh, no, it, uh, uh, it makes, it's something that I haven't heard that term,
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.160]   but when you said it, it hit me so hard in my heart that I was like, oh yeah, that.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.640]   I mean, I think about, it just automatically made me think about the
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.660]   years I was just drowning and didn't even think about the fact that I had like.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.480]   No male friends and that I was just trying to fill the void with everything else,
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.780]   you know, girls career, you know, whatever.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.460]   Um, and yeah, so I mean, it, it, it makes total sense.
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.600]   Um, but I also think there's some easy fixes we can get into.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.440]   Um, but yeah, I'm here for it.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.720]   And I'm also glad you introduced me as your friend, because that would have
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.340]   been a real sad turn to this segment.
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.600]   Or, or my, or just my only friend, maybe that would have set the segment up better.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.980]   Although dude, I do feel like podcasters, I don't want to get too, uh, too esoteric,
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.480]   but I do feel like we make our friends.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.820]   I mean, this will tie into actually social.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.500]   I mean, I think a lot of people have convinced themselves that if they talk to
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.160]   a lot of people on Twitter or social media, that they're actual friends and it's
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.220]   like, or I mean, even like girls on only fans and it's like, no, that is not a
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.560]   real connection, it's artificial.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.460]   And even for us, for podcasters, you know, I consider guys friends.
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.140]   And then I realized I've just podcasted with them.
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.940]   Right.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:01.420]   Frequent guest on your podcast does not equate to a male, male friendship.
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.940]   Like I've been on your show like four times, like, come on, we're best friends.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.700]   Um, let me show you, I'll show you, let me show you the actual
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.400]   article that coined this term.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.260]   We'll look at a couple of the claims here and see if we're all on the same page.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.700]   All right.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.700]   So as far as I can tell, this Daniel Cox article from a couple of years ago from
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.820]   the national review is where the term friendship recession was introduced.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.340]   It was then supercharged by Richard Reeves doing a big think interview more
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.020]   recently, but I think this was the original source.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.460]   It just didn't spread as much back then.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.380]   I guess we were still thinking about pandemics and such.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.740]   Uh, so here's a couple of quotes from this article just to put us on the same
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.820]   page, um, as Americans try to rebuild and reconnect a new survey conducted by the
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.980]   survey center on American life finds that the social landscape is far less favorable.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.100]   Then it once was over the past three decades, the number of close
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.140]   friends Americans have has plummeted.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.380]   This friendship recession first use of that term in print, I believe
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.900]   is particularly bad for men.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.580]   The percentage of men with at least six close friends fell by half since 1990.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.900]   From 55% to 27%.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.700]   The study also found the percentage of men without any close friends
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.100]   jumped from 3% to 15%, a five fold increase.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.180]   Single men have fared worse.
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.220]   Uh, I also heard the author Richard Reeves, when he was talking about this
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.300]   more recently cite a study that said loneliness is equivalent from a health
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.580]   perspective to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.860]   All right.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.780]   So we've got a couple of things.
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.300]   When you smoke a cigarette, you look cool when you're just lonely.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.220]   What a bummer.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.980]   Well, and also you, you're going to get friends if you smoke cigarettes
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.620]   because they're going to think you're awesome.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.060]   Go smoke cigarettes.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.940]   What are you doing?
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.740]   What was that on a podcast?
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.580]   Um, yeah, man, that, uh, you know, I mean, geez, I'm even thinking about.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.380]   I think I have really healthy male friendships now for the first time in my
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.180]   life, it's helped me a lot, but as you were reading that, I started to think
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.100]   like how rare it is, so like my brother is still friends with like his best
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.020]   friends from high school and my reaction to that is like, what's wrong with you
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.180]   guys when that probably is like, it's so healthy, it's so good.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.900]   And yeah, how that ties into loneliness.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.980]   I really think that a huge part of it is we're getting these false
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.180]   senses of friendship from the internet.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.860]   You know, Oh, me and all these people are mad at Ted Cruz on Twitter.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.820]   That's, that's my posse, right.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.700]   Or, or again, I mean, only family I've never, I have girlfriends
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.940]   who have only fan pages.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.820]   I've never talked to them about it, but I've never subscribed, but
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.780]   apparently it is, uh, you know, you're, you're talking back and forth to them.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.620]   Like you're in a relationship or like you're, you know, whatever.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.260]   And so if you're already lonely and nervous about the real world or
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.660]   nervous to date or whatever, and then you just have these tools like, Hey,
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.460]   here's a sense of it.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.980]   Um, I can just see how that would just like spiral into utter despair.
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.020]   Right, right.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.740]   There's a technological element also explaining this.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.780]   I cited some of these studies in my book, digital minimalism.
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.740]   These at the time, they seemed paradoxical, but these studies that
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.740]   showed when social media use went up, so did loneliness, and then the social
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.100]   psychologist followed up and said, what's going on here?
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.500]   And they introduced this term, social snacking, where they said, as you use
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.780]   social media more, you convince yourself that you're getting your
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.940]   daily dose of social interaction.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.340]   So you do less of the analog social interaction, but our brain does not
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.820]   recognize digital interaction, especially just text-based interaction, like on a
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.700]   text message screen or leaving comments on Instagram, our brain doesn't recognize
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.580]   that as interacting.
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.060]   So you think you're social deeper in your brain.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.900]   They're saying we haven't interacted with a human in weeks and you feel
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.340]   sort of paradoxically lonely.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.380]   So technology, it made this worse is what it, what it sounds.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.060]   Well, I mean, you know, you eat a, you eat two buckets of KFC chicken and
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.180]   you're like, all right, I'm really full and feel sick.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.180]   And I guess I got my protein intake, but it's just like, are you actually
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.620]   getting like substance?
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:15.260]   You know, it's that's why, you know, when friends of mine or me even would
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.300]   like really poor and younger, you just eat a bunch of fast food because you're
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.740]   like, well, this is cheap and I'm getting so much.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.220]   And it's like, yeah, but you're not, you're getting so much like, and you're
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.820]   getting all these empty calories.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.260]   You're not getting real, you know, nutrition.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.740]   And so really similar.
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.580]   Now, let me, before we get to, I want to get to the specifics of your
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.500]   transformation, because it's very interesting to me, your friend
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.660]   transformation, but just because you're, you're more in touch with the culture
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.500]   around us than I am, because, you know, I'm married with a bunch of kids and I'm
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.020]   too busy and don't know what's going on.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:46.580]   And I'm a nerd.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.420]   That was kind of a nice way of being like, you're, uh, you're sad and, uh,
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.500]   don't have a family.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.380]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.420]   So when it comes to sad family list people, I think number one person.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:07:59.740]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.220]   You and Jennifer Aniston, like these are the two, um, no, but when you just look
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.980]   around, you're, you're, you're out in the world more than I am.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.380]   Do you buy that?
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.900]   It's, this is worse in general.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.620]   Like when you're talking to other men, when you see other men, uh, you know,
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.500]   in your social circles, are people, are you seeing this?
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.380]   Are people lonely?
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.460]   Are people talking about it?
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.740]   What's the word from the street, Jamie?
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.580]   Men are desperate for connection and it is.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.700]   You know, it's, it's hard, man.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.380]   It's weird.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:36.420]   Uh, because it's hard enough to find a girlfriend, to find someone to date, to
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:42.220]   ask someone out, let alone, you're kind of doing the same thing, but like with a
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.740]   dude, you know what I mean?
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.100]   Like I even noticed that, and I'm sure the guys listening to this can like cop to
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.940]   this as I remember, I just became really good friends with my, uh, my trainer, the
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.020]   dude who trains me at the gym.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:02.980]   And you know, I would come home and I would like light up to my girlfriend
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.500]   about him just like you would when you met a girl.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.660]   I was like, Oh my God, Travis, like he's so sweet.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.500]   And like, he's like really pushing me harder.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.780]   And like, I felt like I, like I PR today and then we got in the sauna and like,
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.220]   man, we were talking about like spirituality and suddenly like, as I'm
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.540]   describing him, I'm like, Oh, this is how I would describe, Oh my God, I just met
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:21.940]   this girl.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.620]   She's so cute.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.940]   Like we vibe on the same things.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.140]   We have the same goals, blah, blah, blah.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:33.700]   And, uh, but it, it, it, it takes a little bit of like security, you know?
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.740]   I mean, Cal, when we grew up, everything was called gay.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.460]   It's like, Oh, you're showing emotion.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.020]   Oh, you're, you know, in touch with your feelings.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.300]   Like, Oh, you're hanging out with that.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:52.020]   And so like, I really do think there's this weird part in men where it's like,
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.820]   we want so desperately that male connection.
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.780]   Like jujitsu so popular.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.100]   Um, you know, we, we, we, we've, we've gone from handshakes to like bro hug, but
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.900]   like full hug is only for like really good.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:09.340]   Like there is, uh, we crave that camaraderie, but it's also like, we don't
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.260]   want to be weird.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:16.500]   Um, especially as you get older, I mean, making friends in general is super hard.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.260]   What, I mean, do you think something has changed about that?
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.860]   So in other words, in 1990, that was the end point of that article that like in
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.660]   1990 compared to now there's been this five fold increase in not having close
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.660]   friends, et cetera.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:35.940]   Was there, I mean, there must be a pathway to male friendships that existed in the
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.860]   dozen now, because of course it's not that in 1990, we were much more comfortable,
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.420]   you know, expressing feel that's when we grew up, right.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.260]   As you were saying, this was where, uh, yeah, if you were in touch with your
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.060]   feelings, that was gay.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.620]   But if you used a phrase, you're in touch with your feelings, that too was gay.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.900]   And so it all sort of recursively piled up on itself.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.540]   So what was it?
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.900]   There must've been, maybe it's just the, the, the, the role of work maybe was more
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.380]   stability and location.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.380]   You didn't move so much.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.380]   Maybe it was church.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.060]   Maybe it was family earlier.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.700]   There's gotta be something that was a cheat code for male friendships.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.300]   Then when that was removed, it was suddenly to use a metaphor from our
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:10.900]   childhood.
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.620]   You couldn't beat the boss and Contra because you no longer had the, you no
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.080]   longer had the super gun or whatever.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.340]   I don't really know what that would be.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.300]   I don't know if you have any thoughts about 1990 versus now.
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:20.940]   No.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.460]   So I think that it definitely has to do with the internet and it just has to do
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.620]   with like less social gatherings in general.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.020]   Right.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.900]   So I was always a girlfriend guy.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.620]   I believe the term is codependent and I would always just, my relationship was
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.180]   everything.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.020]   And when I broke up, that's why this breakup going through now is super weird.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.860]   And actually I'm leaning on male friendships for the first time because
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.980]   usually I lose a girlfriend and I go, ah, I gotta go to the next girlfriend.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.140]   Right?
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.460]   Like that's the only option for connection.
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.860]   And so I think like, if you look at 1990, there were just more gatherings, right?
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.180]   More people went to church.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.620]   There were, if you were a liberal, you were unions, you, you know, you, you
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.380]   weren't working from home as much.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.820]   You went to an office, you went to an office every day.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.340]   The last time I had friends was like my football team in high school.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.260]   And I've been like getting out of shape.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.180]   It's like, go to a gym, join a CrossFit, do jujitsu.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.620]   I mean, if I didn't do jujitsu, I'd probably still have zero male friends.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.020]   That was the thing for me.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:29.180]   So you do something cool and challenging with guys who, you know, you.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.300]   All like most of my male friends I look up to.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.020]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.220]   And I don't know if people think, you know, when they're, when, when, when
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.260]   they're looking for friends that like, they have to be the cool one.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.500]   And it's like, no, you don't want a bunch of little like mean girl underlings.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.340]   Like you will be good enough.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.620]   People love helping other people.
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.100]   You know?
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.820]   I mean, the fighters I hang out with are the best fighters in the world.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.420]   And they're not like, you can't hang out with us until you become
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.340]   the best fighter in the world.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.380]   I give something else to that circle and then they build me up
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.700]   and make me a better fighter.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.380]   Um, and so literally just like, again, this, it sounds like they
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.820]   didn't advise shoot your shot.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.820]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.820]   Well, okay.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.540]   And it's like, uh, when you're talking about hanging out with the best fighters
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:16.060]   in the world, uh, I can't help, but think about the, the guy from blood sport.
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.020]   Whose main fighting style was the just boom, the guy with the beard and the,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.860]   and the American with the Harley Davidson shirt, but him hanging out with John
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:29.180]   Claude Van Damme or David Dukes as the character's name was probably, uh, really
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.820]   life affirming for him until, uh, he was put into a coma by being too cocky about
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.060]   knocking out the guy with the giant pecs.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.900]   But I think this is, it's very apt, right?
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.780]   It, it raised his element, but okay.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.220]   So this is what I want to get to now.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.820]   So we're gonna talk about
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:48.060]   be friended, all of those drug locks Jamaican instead of killing them.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.540]   Would he have, would he have found a healthier inner life balance?
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.260]   I think so.
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.700]   I just read a book about Steven Seagal, by the way, this is a different story, but
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.100]   okay.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.140]   We'll talk about that afterwards.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.580]   Cause I became friends with his daughter.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.460]   Who's very nice.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.500]   Uh, but I have so many questions for her that I'm just like, like sitting on.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.340]   Oh my God.
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.580]   It was such a weird, it was a whole, it was a whole book about
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.820]   1980s action films and all of those actors.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.460]   Um, weird, interesting, fantastical, terrible.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.380]   It's just, okay.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:18.700]   Anyways.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.860]   Uh, we'll put that aside.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.900]   I mean, I think what we're trying to build towards is we would like
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.260]   a Steven Seagal to be our friend.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.180]   All right, but let's go back to, let's go to your life though.
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:27.340]   Right?
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:32.460]   Because my, my understanding is, um, you recently added, you made male
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.940]   friendships really for the first time in a long time, a big part of your life.
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.980]   My understanding of your timeline, tell me if I have this wrong, but here's my,
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.460]   here's my Jamie Kilstein timeline.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:40.820]   All right.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.020]   This always makes me nervous.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.780]   You're living in LA more or less just hanging out with Moby.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.660]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.860]   Then you move to Arizona.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.660]   And as far as I can tell, you were living in a retirement community.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.420]   So you're essentially hanging out with, with, uh, um, old ladies.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:57.780]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:03.140]   And like elderly Mexican men, then you moved to Austin and it's somehow, once
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.100]   you got to Austin, you now seem to have a lot of friends that you do things with.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:06.380]   All right.
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.540]   So give us the story here.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.820]   How did you get friends?
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.260]   Like what as a 40 year old male at the time in Austin, Texas, what happened?
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.380]   Okay.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.580]   So here's what I think happened.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:24.780]   And again, this is very similar to dating advice that time in Arizona,
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.420]   when I was like kind of a hermit.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.700]   Um, so I moved to Arizona with an ex-girlfriend of mine because we were in
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:39.500]   LA and we were clearly settling for each other, but we were both nice enough.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.420]   We were just, it was my only dating app, uh, relationship.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.860]   And we were just like, she was tired of creepy guys.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.340]   I was tired of like LA girls on the internet.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:53.180]   And, um, we just so desperately wanted to make it work that we were like, you
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.460]   know what, this it's probably LA's fault.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.220]   It's probably not us.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.460]   We should just leave LA.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.100]   And so I end up in, so we go to air, we literally picked a place randomly on the
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:07.020]   map and so we were outside of Tucson, Arizona and not surprisingly, um, we
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.620]   broke up, um, I think probably like a year after living in Arizona, like
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.940]   right before COVID happened.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:18.740]   So my first time as being a single adult male was over COVID.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.580]   Um, which is, Oh boy.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.700]   Um, it's a really like a do or die situation, which is like, am I going to
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.660]   kill myself or am I going to do what I probably should have done a long time ago,
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.140]   which is like figure out who I am.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:39.260]   The year that I spent by myself was the first time that I figured out who I
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:46.340]   really was and I couldn't try to fill that gap with, so now I have this breakup.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.260]   It was a loving breakup.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.140]   It was a sad breakup.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:56.620]   I had this breakup with, with my girlfriend and I have to fight the urge to be
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.220]   like, okay, just find a new girlfriend because usually we're so used to kind of
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:07.620]   like adapting, um, to whoever, like the next person is COVID did not allow me to
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:08.980]   do, there was no other option.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.180]   I couldn't date.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.500]   I couldn't have friends.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.700]   I couldn't do any of this stuff.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.700]   And so for your listeners who are really lonely right now and are struggling, I
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:23.260]   can say that the first thing you should do before you date, before you even make
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.180]   male friends is figure out like, who are you?
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.380]   Because that year I was reading books.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.980]   I was finally watching the movies I wanted to watch.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.540]   I was like taking walks in nature.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.940]   I started meditating.
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.740]   I was doing all these things on my own.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.780]   So, so what you're saying is, so you got, uh, familiar with yourself.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.460]   Yep.
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.420]   Took the time to actually be with yourself.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.380]   And I, and I would add the addendum to that, which you're not going to do by
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.780]   spending more time on screen.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.340]   So we'll just add in that caveat.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:58.540]   Notice every example, Jamie gave walks, meditation, getting back into activities
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.580]   he had enjoyed before reading books, watching movies, none of this was, um,
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.820]   fight on Twitter with your crew.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.540]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:05.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.660]   Get your Instagram follower.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:07.820]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.820]   Bus only fan.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.660]   Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:12.220]   Okay.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.100]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:13.780]   All right.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.420]   So then you, so you, you got to know yourself and then it sounds like what
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:21.820]   happened was you use that to identify meaningful analog activity.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.220]   Now that you had the self-reflection, you could identify, uh, like for you, for
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.780]   example, you got back in the jujitsu, which is something you had done very
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.900]   seriously, um, earlier in your life.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.420]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.140]   And then, uh, then church after that, which again was coming out of self-reflection.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.060]   You were now very familiar.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.500]   You were familiar enough with yourself that when you were sort of looking around
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.660]   and hanging out with the sort of spiritual, not religious types, like this
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.860]   isn't quite right, I think a church, but this church that required self.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.180]   Knowledge, right.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.500]   You actually, I think of the church and was like, do I hate Moby?
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:56.580]   Um, but yeah, no, I mean like, dude, the, my superpower and the reason I'm not
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:04.340]   dead is like being able to like be self analytical, it started as self hate,
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.740]   which sometimes can backfire.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.100]   Um, but yeah, just being like, why am I here?
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:09.300]   What?
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:15.260]   Because I also want to add that if you're looking for friends or a girl going to a
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.100]   bar every night, just like screens also isn't the answer, right?
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.900]   Because you feel like, well, I'm surrounded by people, but you're numbing yourself
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.020]   out, you're having vapid conversations.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.300]   If you can even have a conversation over the music.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.180]   Like, I always joke that I want to meet my next girlfriend, just like at a bookstore.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:32.580]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.140]   Um, like, I just want to like, we accidentally both reach for like the
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.900]   same, the graphic novel, the same Calvin and Hobbes book or something.
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:47.300]   Um, and, but I think that, and when we, when we were talking, you know, right
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:52.620]   before we went on air, um, about this, I did not think that this is where this was
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.580]   nowhere in my head that I was going to veer in this direction.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:01.380]   Um, but as I talk about it, I realize, oh my God, this is the most important
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.580]   thing you can do, which sounds, um, uh, counterintuitive because we're
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.380]   talking about being lonely.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.020]   So it's like, why would you want to spend more time with yourself?
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:16.860]   There is such a difference between, you know, if I stayed at home all day and
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:23.260]   just scrolled on Instagram and watched porn and, you know, texted my ex like,
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.580]   yeah, dude, that's a real lonely day by myself.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.140]   But if I write and I go to the gym and maybe instead of having coffee here, I go
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.100]   to Starbucks and I asked the, the, the barista how they're doing, and I have
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.980]   that interaction and then I meditate and then I journal what I've.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.460]   Like I'm waking up early, not sleep at the, I wake up at five 15.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.220]   I don't have a job.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:41.780]   I'm an artist.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.380]   I'm a comic.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.260]   I wake up at five 15 every day so that I can have that time to myself.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:52.660]   Um, man, when I'm around people, that's how I can be my authentic self.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.020]   And then when you're being your authentic self, you will attract, um, people who
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.220]   are like, oh, I like that guy.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:04.580]   And you will also be able to walk away from, um, a circle of friends that
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.380]   maybe that's just, you know, whatever, whatever the hookup version is of, of
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:09.980]   friends.
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:10.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.300]   Okay.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.540]   So then there's one final step here to get out the, the, the touch on.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.820]   So we have the self-reflection leads to activities that are deeply meaningful.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.900]   You're meeting people through those activities.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.380]   So you're, you're now surrounded by people who are on the same wavelength.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.780]   So this is clearly going to be a source of, uh, high quality friendships.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.420]   I guess the final piece then is there's still a little bit of trigger polling
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.980]   that requires a little strategizing.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.420]   We hinted at this earlier, but now it's like, I
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.220]   really like these guys.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.420]   And we're on the same wavelength and, uh, they make me better.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.540]   And I really like hanging out with them.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.340]   So then there's that final piece, right?
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:42.660]   Okay.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.940]   Now I have to just have the courage to say, and this is the dating analogy, but.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.540]   Hey, you want to come watch the fight or do you want to come do whatever?
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.140]   So, so what did you discover about that?
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.900]   Is that as bad as men fear or is it just something you got to just go for?
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:57.100]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.580]   I'm like, I'm running through because I'm also, um, I'm an introvert and so I'm
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.300]   not good at it.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.740]   I seem very like bubbly and social in social settings.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.820]   It's just cause I'm projecting and I'm terrified.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.420]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:16.460]   Um, so I definitely haven't been like, you know, Hey, do you want to go get
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.060]   coffee?
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.260]   I mean, I have my pastors, but that's like their job.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.980]   Um, I feel like when my pastor's hanging out with me, that's like, if I was like,
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.100]   I had sex, but like I paid an escort, it's like, what is she supposed to do that?
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.820]   Um, my pastor see him sad, but like, okay.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:37.180]   So be someone you would want to hang out with is number one, right?
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:44.660]   So if I go to jujitsu and I sit in the corner and scowl at everybody, um, I'm
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.460]   probably not going to get an invite to hang out.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.300]   But if every time I go to spar with someone, I go, Hey man, what's your name?
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.020]   Great.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.220]   And then we roll and I go, Hey, when you did this, that was really good.
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.980]   You know, blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.700]   And then maybe they start coming and asking me for advice, you know, whatever.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.420]   Um, maybe everyone, maybe you're the funny person.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.140]   Maybe you're the person who just asked people how their day is.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.260]   Maybe you just, you know, my, uh, my main jujitsu coach is this guy,
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.380]   Marcelo Garcia, who is the best in the world.
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.580]   So his gym was like packed, but every day he would go up and he would walk around
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.820]   while people were chatting and he would shake everyone's hand.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.260]   Um, and so I try to do that when I go to a gym, I try to like, you know, if I'm
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.740]   teaching the kids class, I'll shake the parents hand, stuff like that.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.540]   Um, and then through that, people just feel comfortable around you and maybe
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.540]   they start asking you questions and maybe they just become your gym buddy.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.900]   I have dozens of gym buddies who I've never hung out with, but there are also
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.540]   people that if I show up and they go, Hey, how are you doing?
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.540]   I can tell them, Hey man, I'm struggling.
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.220]   I got this breakup and they will give me amazing advice before class.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.540]   Um, then usually in these places, there are like group activities.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.900]   So if you're going to a CrossFit gym or a jujitsu place, chances are, yeah,
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.700]   when there's a big pay-per-view, they're going to watch the fights and.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:07.820]   You know, you can be so likable that they invite you.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.820]   There have definitely been times where I'm like, I just have a good enough
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.020]   sense that I'm like, these guys like me, like they follow me on Instagram.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.260]   Even if I don't follow them, like, I think they like me that I'll even be like,
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.100]   Hey guys, if there's ever room, like I'd love to watch the fights with you.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.460]   You don't have to say, can I come and watch Izzy fight this Saturday?
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.940]   But you can go like, Hey, if there's ever, or if you're ever going out, um,
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.740]   one of my church friends, uh, this girl, AJ.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.420]   The day after the breakup I go, Hey man, I gotta be more social.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:36.780]   I know.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.540]   Like, I usually say no when you guys like invite me out, but like, if there's
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.140]   ever anything going on, can you at least like float it to me?
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.340]   And she goes, Oh my God, I'm having a birthday dinner tonight.
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.940]   I was like, didn't want to invite.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.140]   I figured you wouldn't want to go.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.140]   Do you want to go?
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.140]   And I went and then I met a bunch of different church friends and now they've
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:59.540]   hit me up, um, the one piece of advice I really want to give, cause I know you
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:04.460]   won't give it on another piece, uh, on another episode is this is where social
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.620]   media can actually be kind of good.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:12.020]   Um, and maybe I don't know if it's this, I think it's for normie people.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.380]   Cause I have a bit of like an audience.
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.420]   So people think it's in my real life.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.180]   If they don't know what I do, they think it's cool.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:18.860]   And they follow me.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:24.620]   But, um, I have had a couple people that I've met from jujitsu or church or
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.900]   whatever, that they'll find me on Instagram.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:33.300]   And that kind of tells me, Oh, this person like likes me.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.180]   And maybe when they write me on Instagram, you know, I can't write like
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:42.300]   every like random person back, but like when they write me, I go, Oh shit.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.540]   Nehemiah from church is hitting me up.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.660]   Like about my story.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.380]   Like maybe I actually have more in common with him than I thought.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:53.260]   And that will kind of like, um, that'll be an icebreaker for, cause I don't want
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.340]   to just, I have very low self-confidence.
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.660]   Um, so I don't assume people like me.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.820]   Um, but if I see someone's like followed me on Instagram, I'm like, Oh, okay.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.620]   But then where you will agree is then it's your job to not keep
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.580]   that relationship in Instagram.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.060]   Right.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.220]   I mean, you're describing like 2010 social media where it really was.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:13.540]   Okay.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.300]   My, my friends follow this.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.620]   We keep up with each other.
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.380]   And sometimes I get a second order connection, like a friend of a friend
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.380]   who I sort of know is a way for them to interact with me.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.780]   And that was the heyday of social media.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.340]   It was just, yeah.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:26.700]   Yes.
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.820]   That's different than being like, I'm friends with Tucker Carlson because we
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.700]   both hate the same people on Twitter.
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.860]   It was like, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.980]   He liked a tweet of mine.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:34.660]   Uh, all right.
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.260]   This is excellent.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.820]   So I'm going to do what I do, which is try to reduce this all down to, uh,
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.060]   step-by-step advice for my listeners.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.820]   So this is the Jamie Kilstein prescription.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.860]   Um, well, first of all, the, the setup here is that especially for males, uh,
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.660]   friendships are really important, especially, uh, as you're getting to
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:57.380]   your thirties and forties, as we, as Jamie was talking about, it is, if
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.180]   anything, like a buffer against hard things that happen in your life,
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.820]   a, a, a source of motivation, et cetera.
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.380]   So you need them.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:08.060]   Don't, don't just have, uh, don't just keep in touch with your high school
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.420]   buddies or just know like,
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.460]   I don't want to mess up your list, but I didn't go into nearly as much
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.700]   detail on that I was trying to get to the how to, but like, it has saved my life.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:19.700]   A hundred percent.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:25.620]   I have been going through so much for the last decade, 15 years of my life.
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:32.340]   That having strong male friends who I look up to be able to like, when I'm
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:36.020]   struggling, like this sounds so cheesy, but like put a hand on my shoulder and
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.620]   be like, dude, I see how hard you're working.
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.820]   You are going to be like, so good.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.500]   You have no idea how far you've come since even the first day I met you and
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:51.540]   having another man tell you that you just go, Oh, like that's so much different
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.540]   than even like your wife being like, babe, you got this.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.300]   It's just, it's different.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.940]   Um, yeah, it's, it's, it's been.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:27:59.860]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.540]   Right.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.180]   So, uh, fundamental, it's saved Jamie's life.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:03.660]   Fundamental.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.020]   Okay.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.340]   Um, so, so how do we do this?
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.620]   Well, if we're going to, if we're going to make a prescription here, one, I
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.700]   would say go back to, you know, my digital declutter is a good starting place.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.500]   The thing we talk about in digital minimalism, where you take 30 days away
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:20.180]   from all this optional technology, do self-reflection experimentation.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.900]   We usually talk about the digital declutter just as a way of figuring
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.940]   out how to update your technology use.
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.300]   But now let's add that on as the first step towards upgrading your
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.900]   friendship situation, because during that 30 days of reflection experimentation,
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.500]   you get to know yourself better.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.500]   Now, typically we say at the end of that 30 days, I look at your tech use fine,
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:45.260]   but let's add a new obligation here at the end of that 30 days, join something.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.140]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.900]   Join something based on what you discovered during that 30 day declutter
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.460]   that is going to surround you with other people who are on the same
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.140]   wavelength with your values.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.740]   Um, and I would add to that.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.340]   Being around those people will probably also bring other
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.340]   things into your radar to join.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.180]   I mean, Jamie, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's, there's a synergy between
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.100]   uh, you getting back in the jujitsu and the church because there's,
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.140]   there's crossovers, right?
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.420]   Some of the people that the fighters you were meeting were also religious.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.260]   And so these things cross pollinate, they weren't two separate thoughts.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.460]   It was like, once you're in the world of people you admire and like to be
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.580]   around other meaningful things emerge.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.580]   I mean, I got that right.
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:23.780]   Right.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.620]   It was all these things sort of mixed together.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.420]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:30.620]   And that actually, that, that, that's another great tip, which is like, once
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.620]   you know yourself and you have these interests and these things that you
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.500]   love that are kind of different or whatever, you're going to be able to
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.540]   connect with these people and then you're going to be able to like, you know,
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.660]   like, you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.780]   You know, like, you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.820]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.580]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.420]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.020]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.300]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.340]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.940]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.100]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.020]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.940]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.140]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.420]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.620]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.020]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.420]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.780]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.460]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.020]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.420]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.940]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.100]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.620]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.860]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:42.860]   And then you're going to be able to connect with these people.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.860]   And let me know.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:50.260]   I mean, I have like this civilian commando gear.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:55.020]   I've got this bear shaman, you know, mask helmet.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.340]   Look, I have it, you know, whatever.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.340]   You're raiding a building.
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.340]   Just let me know.
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.340]   Just going to collect dust.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.340]   Just going to collect.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.540]   I'm not using it, you know.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.700]   I'm not using it.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.660]   Let me know what could go wrong.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.140]   I think everyone will forgive us.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.220]   Yeah, that's a good turn.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.220]   Yeah, good turn.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.540]   Okay, so that, but here's what's cool about that advice though.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.100]   Is like right now, if you're listening to this and you're thinking, you know what, this
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.460]   is me, I'm lonely.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.460]   I'm online all the time and I'm feeling lonely.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.500]   I have no backstop.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.980]   This plan we're talking about, this is six months from right now, potentially to a very
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.100]   upgraded friend relationship.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.580]   A month or so of self-reflection, you join things, get involved for a few months.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.580]   That's it.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.000]   Yeah, you do that.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.460]   You're going to have at least a few new friends and then it's going to snowball from there,
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.820]   you know, and then like, well, this and some, you're going to tighten some friendships and
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.820]   others will loose.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.300]   But that's it like six months from now.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.500]   Uh, because it went fast for you, Jamie.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.700]   So like give, give our listeners hope like six months from now, you really could be in
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.580]   a, a very positive social situation.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:57.140]   Friendlines everything else, you know, it's like that builds you up.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.780]   Um, so you become a more confident person.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.960]   You being a more confident person leads to other things in your life.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.700]   You know, I, this is very hard for me to say because I've been flamed by a lot of like
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.780]   constantly online people.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:18.620]   But what I will say is like, while it is not healthy to only have these relationships online,
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:25.140]   clearly you're in, if you're listening to this, like you're intelligent, you're funny,
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.140]   right?
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:30.340]   Like, um, you make people laugh on Twitter or Reddit or whatever.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:38.340]   Um, those skills that you have online, it's going to be nerve wracking at first, but they
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:44.500]   do translate, they do tra like if you can make people laugh online, you can make people
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.740]   laugh, um, in real life.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.980]   It's just about building up that confidence and that's going to be a, you know, a step
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.840]   by step process and then show yourself grace.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   You know, um, if you do get nervous and you're like, oh, this is so stupid, you know, ever
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.060]   since I started reading, they were listening to self development podcasts or even with
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:10.860]   religion, um, the worst you can feel sometimes is before the breakthrough where you go, I'm
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.580]   doing the right stuff.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:16.040]   Like I go to church now, why would I have a breakup?
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.040]   You know?
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.740]   Um, or I'm trying to make friends.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:24.260]   I did everything Cal said and I showed up at the fights and I was too nervous and didn't
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.260]   say anything.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.420]   I guess there's no hope.
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.420]   Nope.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.420]   That's just the first step.
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.700]   And then the next time you're like, I'm going to talk a little more.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.060]   And then the next time and you just keep piling on wins.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.060]   Yep.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.060]   And you look back and say, I'm glad I started right.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.060]   Exactly.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.060]   We did there.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.060]   All right.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.060]   Well, excellent.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.060]   Well, this was great, Jamie.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:46.060]   Um, just reminder for the audience, your podcast is the back row with Jamie Kilstein.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.060]   What's that website, Jamie?
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.060]   Yeah, you can go to back row pod.com.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:55.340]   Um, and there's the, the YouTube channel and I have a, I have a newsletter I do every week
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:58.460]   now where I'm writing about mental health and stuff like that.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:03.020]   And, uh, yeah, we're talking about like the mental health spiritual journey, but also,
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.780]   um, they're getting a little more into like culture politics and trying to bring people
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.300]   together and laugh at the ridiculousness of it all.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.540]   Sounds, uh, with something to do with friends.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.540]   All right, Jamie.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.540]   Well, thanks for joining me.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.500]   I look forward to talking to you again in four months.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   That's the way we do it.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   Bye old friend.
