[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   [silence]
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.080]   Now, the list of tools I'm about to describe
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.400]   is not exhaustive,
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.940]   meaning it doesn't even begin to come close
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.720]   to the total number of tools
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.200]   that one could glean from the discussion
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.660]   about nutrition and supplementation
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.760]   that I had with Dr. Andy Galpin on this podcast.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.940]   But they are the major ones
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.600]   that are definitely worth knowing.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.400]   And those include supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.520]   Now, omega-3 fatty acids are found, of course, in foods,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.720]   things like fatty fish and krill, of all things,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.540]   certain forms of algae, et cetera.
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.720]   But most people do not get enough
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.880]   of so-called EPA form of omega-3s.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.720]   And for that reason,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.440]   I and many other people choose to supplement
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.160]   with a minimum of one gram per day,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.720]   and in some cases, as high as two grams per day,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.280]   of omega-3s in supplement form.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.600]   So typically, one would get to one to two grams of EPA
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.840]   by supplementing their nutrition, their diet, that is,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.040]   with fish oil capsules or liquid fish oil.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.480]   There are many different sources of these.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.800]   That was discussed in an episode
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.160]   that I did with Dr. Rhonda Patrick.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.840]   I find that it's most cost-efficient
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.720]   to get that one to two grams of EPAs from liquid fish oil.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.460]   Despite what you might see on the internet,
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.360]   I don't have any relationship whatsoever
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.640]   to a liquid fish oil company.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.480]   You just wanna make sure that you go with a reputable brand.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.120]   I like the ones that are flavored with lemon
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.960]   so that it offsets the taste of fish oil.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.120]   And I'll take a tablespoon or two of that per day.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.220]   And if I'm traveling, and even if I'm not,
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.240]   I will often use fish oil capsules.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.600]   And there are a variety of different sources
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.540]   of those as well.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.640]   Getting sufficient amounts of omega-3
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.880]   has been shown to be important for mood, okay?
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.460]   So as a way to offset depression,
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.920]   but also for enhancing overall mood.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.540]   That probably relates to the omega-3s effect
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.520]   on neurotransmission,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.120]   not just for neuromodulators like serotonin and dopamine,
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.320]   but for all neurotransmission.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.660]   And neurotransmission, of course,
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.040]   is essential for neuromuscular performance.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.160]   And the omega-3s have been implicated
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.780]   in reducing the inflammation response,
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.720]   cardiovascular health, et cetera.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.120]   I realize that there is some debate about omega-3s,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.440]   but when I look at the bulk of literature
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.680]   about the omega-3s,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.000]   it's very clear to me that getting one to two grams
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.700]   of EPA form of omega-3 per day
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.640]   is the right thing for me to do.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.480]   And many others find that as well.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.080]   The second tool to enhance your fitness
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.560]   under this category of nutrition and supplementation
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.480]   is creatine.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.040]   Now, again, creatine is not just found in supplement form.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.680]   It's also found, of course, in foods,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.040]   in particular, red meat.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.440]   However, the amount of red meat that one would have to eat
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.080]   in order to get the amount of creatine
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.440]   that one would start to see
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.280]   a real performance-enhancing effect is just far too high.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   You'd be ingesting far too much of other things in red meat
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.720]   that you wouldn't want that much of.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.760]   And for that reason,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.160]   I and many other people will take creatine daily.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.840]   We now know there's no need to so-called load creatine
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.680]   in the old days, as it were.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.520]   So old days, by the way, meaning mid '90s and 2000s,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.320]   we were all told that we had to load creatine.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.720]   We had to take high-dose creatine for four or five days,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.000]   and then you could back off to a maintenance dose.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.840]   Now it's very clear
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.560]   you can just take a daily dose of creatine,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.720]   and that it really doesn't matter
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.200]   when you take that creatine.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.280]   You could take it post-workout, as many people do.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.320]   You could take it pre-workout.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.880]   It really doesn't seem to matter.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.300]   I happen to take it post-workout just as a matter of habit.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.480]   But again, you could take it any time of day.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.420]   Now, the point I want to make about creatine
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.440]   is one that's a bit different
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.800]   than the other discussions out there.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.880]   I have no issue with the majority
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.920]   of what's discussed about creatine out there.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.860]   For instance, that creatine monohydrate
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.940]   is the most effective form.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.560]   Fortunately, creatine monohydrate
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.880]   is also the least expensive form of creatine
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.060]   that's sold out there.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.800]   I see no evidence whatsoever
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.120]   that the other forms of creatine
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.500]   are superior to creatine monohydrate.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.160]   But what you'll usually hear
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.500]   is that taking five grams of creatine monohydrate per day
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.400]   is ideal for everybody.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.520]   And that advice is simply not well-informed
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.060]   by the scientific literature.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.540]   If you are a larger person,
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.480]   so for instance, I weigh 100 kilograms,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.700]   so that's about 220 pounds.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.640]   Well, it turns out if you look at the literature
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.720]   on creatine and athletic performance,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.640]   and if you look at the literature on creatine
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.000]   and cognitive performance,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.840]   because as some of you already know,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.760]   creatine is a fuel,
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.840]   or the phosphocreatine system is a fuel system
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.880]   for the brain as well.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.820]   And if you look at the studies on creatine,
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.360]   they almost always gauge the amount of creatine
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.920]   to give an individual based on their body weight.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.360]   So you don't have to get really specific about this,
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.100]   but if you weigh, say, 185 pounds to 250 pounds,
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.520]   you can get away with,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.000]   and probably should be taking 10 grams or so
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.920]   of creatine per day, which is what I do.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.160]   Whereas if you weigh less than that,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.060]   five grams or maybe even three grams is sufficient.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.800]   Now, I discussed this with Dr. Andy Galpin
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.880]   during that series,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.880]   and one of the things that I've started to do
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.400]   since the closure of that series
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.240]   is to take more creatine per day.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.280]   So now I'm taking 10,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.520]   sometimes even as much as 15 grams per day of creatine.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.960]   And again, this is powdered creatine monohydrate.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.360]   My stomach tolerates it very well,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.560]   but frankly, I don't tend to get stomach aches
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.400]   or gastric distress from pretty much anything
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.280]   unless it's some form of food poisoning,
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.120]   which is exceedingly rare for me.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.640]   So some people out there
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.120]   find that creatine really disrupts their gut,
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.260]   and they need to take it with food,
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.120]   or they really need to slowly increase
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.360]   the amount of creatine that they're taking each day.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.920]   I find that I can put 10, even 15 grams of creatine
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.080]   into a whey protein shake
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.360]   or into some water with a little bit of lemon juice
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.340]   just to make it taste a little less chalky, drink that,
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.200]   and I don't have any gastric distress from that.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.920]   So you'll need to find what works for you.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.100]   But the point here is if you're going to take creatine,
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.280]   you don't just want to, quote unquote, take creatine,
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.600]   you know, one scoop per day.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.760]   You really want to adjust the amount of creatine
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.360]   that you're ingesting according to your body weight.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.880]   And I would give you a very specific formula
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.840]   of X grams of creatine per kilogram or pound of body weight,
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.680]   but believe it or not, no such specific recommendation
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.260]   has ever been published in the scientific literature,
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.880]   at least I couldn't find it,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.960]   in a way that's consistent with all the other papers,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.780]   meaning you see a lot of variation.
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.760]   So what I'm talking about here is if you weigh 185 pounds
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.020]   or so, okay, plus or minus five pounds,
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.800]   out to about 250 pounds, 10 to 15 grams of creatine per day
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.880]   is probably more appropriate for you than is five grams,
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.820]   meaning it's going to be more effective
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.220]   for enhancing physical performance.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.940]   And perhaps, again, perhaps even cognitive performance
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.780]   as well.
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.380]   And if you're somebody who weighs, you know, 180 pounds
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.180]   down to say 130 pounds,
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.400]   five grams of creatine per day is probably sufficient.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.320]   The point here is if you are taking creatine,
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.220]   again, not everyone has to take creatine.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.620]   There's no law that says that you have to take creatine.
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.740]   Some people don't like it.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.000]   I know some people fear it's going to make
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.840]   their hair fall out.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.940]   We already talked about that in previous episodes
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.660]   and the lack of data to support that idea.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.700]   But I realize some people steer away from creatine
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.260]   for whatever reason.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.080]   But if you decide that taking creatine is right for you,
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.460]   adjust the total amount of creatine that you take
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.060]   according to your body weight.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.540]   The next supplementation-based tool
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.420]   for enhancing your fitness is a Rhodiola Rosea.
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.380]   Now this very esoteric sounding supplement
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.180]   is one that I learned about both from Dr. Lane Norton
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.820]   when he was a guest on this podcast, expert in nutrition
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.740]   and frankly, training as it relates to resistance training,
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.260]   and from Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.140]   Rhodiola Rosea is a supplement
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.800]   that's gaining increasing attention
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.060]   because it is what's called a cortisol modulator.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.900]   It does not necessarily suppress cortisol.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.940]   It does not increase cortisol.
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.560]   It's a cortisol modulator.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.580]   And frankly, the mechanism by which Rhodiola Rosea
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.700]   modulates cortisol is still under investigation.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.780]   I hope to do an episode about it in the future,
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.660]   or at least make it part of an episode
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.260]   because the hypothesized mechanism
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.460]   that's starting to emerge is really interesting
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.100]   as it relates to neurons in the brain
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.460]   that control the stress response
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.380]   and glands in the body like the adrenals
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.460]   that control the stress response and that secrete cortisol.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.100]   Regardless, there's a growing body of research
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.540]   that has explored Rhodiola Rosea supplementation
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.400]   and one's subjective perception of fatigue or output
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.920]   during high intensity training of various kinds,
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.060]   both resistance training
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.260]   as well as running and endurance type training.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.380]   So I started taking Rhodiola Rosea about six months ago
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.680]   in response to conversations that I had,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.980]   again, with Dr. Lane Norton and with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.500]   And it's a supplement that I take
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.660]   before high intensity workouts.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.380]   So I don't take it before a run
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.980]   because frankly, my runs are either very long and slow
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.420]   or they're very brief,
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.820]   like a high intensity interval training session.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.580]   And I find those to be pretty easy to recover from
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.980]   even though they are very intense.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.980]   I might take a Rhodiola Rosea supplement
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.540]   before doing a 30 minute hill run that's very intense,
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.900]   but typically I only take it about 10 to 15 minutes
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.100]   before any sort of high intensity resistance training session
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.820]   in particular, my leg day,
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.140]   which falls on day two of my exercise protocol
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.140]   or the torso day or the small body parts day.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.440]   Again, here I'm referencing the way that I train
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.660]   across the week and you can find that training protocol
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.700]   as a downloadable, completely zero cost PDF if you like.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.340]   But I realize other people are using
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.900]   different body parts splits and different combinations
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.780]   of resistance training and endurance training.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.260]   The reason I mentioned Rhodiola Rosea in this episode
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.340]   is that I realized that while some people
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.380]   might not yet be supplementing omega-3s,
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.480]   they might not be supplementing creatine,
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.920]   there are many of you who are already doing those things
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.580]   and you're looking for additional tools to give you an edge.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.860]   So again, the Rhodiola Rosea would not fall
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.340]   into the category of foundational supplements.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.500]   Certainly get your nutrition right,
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.900]   get your sleep right, get your sunlight,
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.140]   all the basics first, please,
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.340]   before even thinking about any supplements.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.420]   However, once you get into the category of supplements
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.620]   that can enhance fitness, Rhodiola Rosea does seem
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.640]   to have some good research to support it
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.580]   in the context of lots of different forms
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.300]   of high intensity exercise.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.300]   Now, I can't tell you whether or not it's purely subjective
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.200]   or whether or not it's objective and subjective,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   but my experience has been that when I take Rhodiola Rosea,
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.500]   I definitely notice that I can exert myself harder
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.880]   without feeling like I'm bringing myself
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.460]   to the brink of fatigue,
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.980]   either during the exertion or afterwards.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.380]   In other words, I feel like I can do more work
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.020]   without feeling so exhausted,
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.200]   and I feel as if I'm recovering
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.460]   from my workouts more quickly,
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.760]   in particular across the day after my workouts.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.700]   In fact, if I had to cite one specific subjective effect
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.700]   that I've experienced from taking Rhodiola Rosea
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.820]   before very high intensity workouts,
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.660]   is that prior to taking it,
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.100]   I would often find that three or four hours
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.200]   after the workout, having eaten a good meal,
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   taking a shower, et cetera, and I was tired.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.160]   I'd have a real dip in energy.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.480]   But now I notice I have a lot of energy throughout the day,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.680]   even after these very high intensity sessions
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.160]   in the early part of the day.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.400]   And frankly, I haven't changed anything else
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.580]   about my supplementation or my nutrition,
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.440]   at least nothing major.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.200]   So I personally am going to continue to take Rhodiola Rosea
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.720]   before these high intensity workouts.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.240]   So for me, that's about two or three times per week.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.440]   However, if I forgot to take Rhodiola Rosea before a workout,
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.900]   I have no reason to think that that workout
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.300]   would go much worse.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.100]   This is a supplement that is designed
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.820]   to sort of give you an edge to be able to exert more focus
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.420]   and intensity during your workouts
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.780]   with less perceived exertion and to enhance your recovery.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.500]   The typical dosage of Rhodiola Rosea
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.100]   that you'll find in most supplements
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.620]   is 100 to 200 milligrams.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.180]   And of course, anytime you're going to take a new supplement
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.600]   you would be wise to figure out the lowest effective dose
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.440]   from that supplement.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.400]   That's just logic, right?
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.260]   Why spend more money taking more of something
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.220]   that you don't need more of
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.640]   if you could get away with taking less of it
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.100]   and it's just as effective, maybe even more effective.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.540]   So I typically will take 100 to 200 milligrams
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.320]   of Rhodiola Rosea about 10 to 20 minutes before a workout.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.860]   However, I've taken as little as 100 milligrams
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.060]   on a consistent basis.
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.460]   And frankly, I don't really experience much difference
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.860]   whether I take 100 milligrams
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.740]   or I take 200 milligrams before a workout.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.080]   So lately I've just defaulted to taking 100 milligrams
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.180]   of Rhodiola Rosea before any high intensity workout.
