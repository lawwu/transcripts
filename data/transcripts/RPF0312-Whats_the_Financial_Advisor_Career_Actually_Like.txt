[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Let's do a Q&A today on radical personal finance.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.320]   Kay writes in, asks me a question, says, "Joshua, I would like your thoughts on transitioning
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.220]   from working in the job of a physician to becoming a financial advisor, specifically
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.720]   to becoming a financial advisor with a large insurance company like you were a part of.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:42.880]   Would you do it?"
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.760]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.440]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.860]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.600]   Today we do this Q&A.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.100]   If you were a 31-year-old physician making $150,000 a year and you'd spent the last decade
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.720]   of your life preparing for your career but are really frustrated with it, would you make
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720]   this switch?
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.800]   I'm going to dish the dirt today on radical personal finance and tell you what the business
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.800]   is really like.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:23.020]   I love to do these Q&A questions and I never expected really the question of giving so
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.360]   much information about the business of being a financial advisor to be so popular on the
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.360]   show.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.720]   But what I've learned is that there are many, many of you who have a deep interest in pursuing
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.120]   this career path in some form or another.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.120]   So you're asking me about it.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.600]   Let me just start with reading the email here.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.720]   Yes, I print emails.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.780]   I'm going to read them on the show.
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.240]   You never know when a computer goes down right in the middle of filming your show.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.240]   So this comes in from a listener.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.560]   We're just going to call this listener Kay.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.560]   Kay says, "Hi, Joshua.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.740]   I've been really into personal finance for about five years now and I'm considering becoming
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.980]   a financial advisor with a specific large company very similar to the one you used to
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.980]   work for.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.100]   I'm currently a 31-year-old physician making around $150,000 a year.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.340]   I've spent a long time preparing for my career but I'm always drawn to becoming a financial
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.340]   advisor.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.860]   The medical field is becoming increasingly draining with charting, liability, decreasing
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.820]   reimbursement, increased regulations, etc.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.460]   The problem is in my career I can only make so much money.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.360]   I can see some more patients every day but eventually you can only work so much and with
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.980]   that it would just take more time.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.060]   I already work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day, not even including my commute.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.300]   More patients would just add more time to that.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.340]   Quite frankly, with the liability and difficult patients I see all the time, I don't think
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.620]   I'm paid enough of a premium to take on the risks I take.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.700]   Now, I know everyone says they aren't paid enough but I can literally be sued for anything,
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.760]   especially the surgeries I do.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.340]   In addition, the aggravation of arguing with some patients on deductibles they owe, co-pays,
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.340]   etc.
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.120]   I don't know if you know what it's like to feel – I don't know if you know what
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.960]   it's like to argue with somebody about a $32 bill after giving them necessary medical
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.080]   services because they have insurance and feel they are entitled to everything medically
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.520]   related for free but it is draining.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.840]   I'd love to hear your thoughts on becoming a financial advisor with a company like you
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.000]   were with.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.400]   Pros and cons, what kind of income can I expect and for how long, what was a day like for
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   you?
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.760]   Can you really start taking off with your career?
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.640]   Do a lot of people make it?
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   Why not?
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.320]   How do you actually make money as an advisor?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.160]   Do you develop a niche or do everything?
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   I always imagine being in a nice clean office creating a plan for people's finances.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.840]   Is there a bad side to the business in terms of lifestyle?
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.480]   Is it really difficult finding clients?
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.600]   I know there are hundreds of thousands of advisors out there so there's a lot of competition.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.360]   Also does the regional location make a big difference?
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.260]   I'm a regular listener of your show.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.200]   Not only have I listened to every episode but I've done so numerous times.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.640]   I have all the frugality and investment stuff down for the most part but I'm trying to explore
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.280]   the whole quality of life and work as if I can never retire type of mentality.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.840]   Obviously this is a huge decision so I wanted to get as much detail on the job as possible.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840]   Thanks so much, Kay.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.180]   Well, Kay, it's your lucky day and I'm going to do my best to give you all of the details
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.080]   that I can based upon my personal experience of what the industry is actually like.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.280]   I'm going to tell it to you with as much detail and as much information as I can and I'm going
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.880]   to try to give you the good, the bad and the ugly because you know what?
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.800]   Every career has things that are awesome.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.660]   Every career has things that are not awesome and everything – every career has things
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.160]   that are questionable and there are great things about everything.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.080]   So I'm going to dig into these questions individually one by one.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.580]   I'm going to answer each one of them for you.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.600]   So if you have interest in this type of content or interest in this field, then this is a
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   show that you will enjoy listening to.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.040]   Before I answer these questions though, sponsor of today's show is Trade King.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.440]   Now I need to do this ad up front before we go into the business of a financial advisor
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.960]   because I'll talk about the things that are difficult about the financial advisory
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   business.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.680]   Does everybody need a financial advisor?
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.240]   I think a lot about that question.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.260]   My general answer is yes, but I'll tell you there are a few people who have convinced
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.760]   me that they didn't.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.120]   But those of you who have convinced me of that, you guys are freaks of nature.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.360]   It's just totally detail-oriented and very committed learners and I think that's awesome.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.800]   But does everybody need a financial advisor to house their stocks?
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.320]   Now my answer is no.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.760]   There are many different ways that you can work with a financial advisor.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.120]   Sometimes you may want to manage your investment portfolio yourself.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.720]   You may want to work with somebody that you just pay a straight fee for advice or you
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.120]   may want to manage your portfolio, a side portfolio that you're engaged in trading
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.120]   stocks or doing something interesting and engaging with that.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.700]   If that's the case and if you'd like to hold your investments outside of the clutches
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.840]   of a financial advisor, consider working with Trade King.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.820]   Trade King is a world-class brokerage provider.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.840]   They have really great customer service and really inexpensive trades, $4.95 stock trades.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.200]   You can do other things, options trades, etc.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   But $4.95 stock trades there with Trade King.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.680]   The thing I like and appreciate the most about Trade King is that they are a big enough company
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.160]   to give you the service and education and satisfaction and reliability that you need
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.160]   but they're small enough for you to actually be able to connect with individuals that you
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160]   can come to know.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.800]   Personally, they're right down in Fort Lauderdale.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.920]   If there's a problem – we had one problem a couple of months ago with one listener and
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.280]   I immediately sent an email to the Trade King team.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.160]   The listener hadn't gotten everything fully credited to their account.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.920]   The bonus for using it, I immediately sent an email to the Trade King team and they straightened
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.760]   it out in the next day or two.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.480]   So that's what I love.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.880]   I could get the CEO of Trade King on the phone.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.040]   If I needed to, I could drive down to Fort Lauderdale and knock on his door.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.720]   So consider becoming a – consider transferring or opening a brokerage account with Trade
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   King.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.760]   If you go to TradeKing.com/radical, that's a special tracking link that will allow them
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.120]   to understand the performance of their ad campaign here on my show.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.280]   It will also give you a bonus.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.680]   So you get a $100 bonus after you fund an account with $1,000.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.200]   That's in essence in some ways a 10% return.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.000]   Now you've got to do a couple of trades to get that bonus credited but it's done
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   pretty soon after that.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.920]   So it's a $100 bonus when you open an account with Trade King.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   Please use TradeKing.com/radical.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.720]   So, Kay, I'm going to answer these questions that you asked in the context of your email
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.920]   and I'm just going to go through it one by one.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.040]   In the intro here, I read briefly through the email.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.840]   I'm going to read the specific questions that you wrote here.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.960]   But I want to start with what you wrote in the introduction and this might be the most
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.680]   valuable thing.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.440]   You said, "The problem is in my career, I can only make so much money."
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.880]   Let me point out to you, that's not the problem of your career.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.040]   That's the problem of the way that you are participating in your career.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.240]   The reason I know that is because there are lots of medical doctors who are making way
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.960]   more money and there are lots of medical doctors who are participating in the practice and
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:11.240]   business of medicine in a business structure that doesn't involve their trading time
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.120]   for money.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:20.120]   You've invested a lot of time and a lot of energy into becoming a physician.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:26.440]   I'm going to give you the inside scoop on what the financial advisory business is like.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.240]   But you've got to recognize you've invested a lot of time and energy into becoming a physician.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.920]   Now should you just automatically say, "Well, because I've invested so much time and energy
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.600]   into this career," no.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.180]   If you were to say that, we would be succumbing to what we've talked about in the past is
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.640]   the sunk cost fallacy.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.100]   In general, you always want to ignore what's happened in the past when you're making a
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.280]   fresh decision.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.600]   You want to ignore the fact that you have invested a decade into something.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:01.320]   If you've invested a decade of blood, sweat, and tears and time into this career, that's
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.520]   not necessarily any reason for you to keep doing it.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   If you can't stand the career, if you can't stand the business, if you don't have any
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:14.240]   interest in it, if you don't have any desire or passion for it in any way, then there's
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.440]   no reason to waste another year of your life on it.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.840]   So what if you've invested a decade?
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   It's all done.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.840]   It's gone.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   It's irrelevant.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   It's sunk.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.220]   So we call it the sunk cost fallacy.
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.640]   You look forward and say, "Am I still excited about this going forward?"
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.640]   Zero-based thinking, famous, most important question, one of the most valuable ways of
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.220]   thinking, "Is there anything which, knowing what I now know, if I were going to do it
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.840]   over again, that I would do differently?"
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   Ask yourself that question.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.100]   Now, it would appear to me, especially since you said that you've listened to all the past
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.260]   episodes of the show, it would appear to me that you've been doing that.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.220]   And your answer to the question is no.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.420]   If you were to do it all over again, work through the process of becoming a physician,
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.960]   would you do it over again, knowing what you now know?
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.960]   The answer is no.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.740]   At least that's what I'm picking up from your email.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.820]   But that doesn't necessarily mean that you automatically need to change from the career
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.120]   of a physician to being in the career of a financial advisor.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.660]   Because my guess is what's actually going on here, it's not that you don't like medicine.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.000]   It's not that you don't appreciate certain aspects of working with people and helping
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.040]   people with their medical problems.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.320]   Rather, it's that there are some aspects of your job now that are really driving you crazy.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.720]   And because of those things that are driving you crazy, you're feeling extremely disillusioned
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.280]   with the whole business.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.600]   But it's probably not the whole business that's the problem.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.840]   It's probably just parts of it.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:50.200]   And it's very possible and very doable for you to adjust and change within the practice
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.740]   of medicine into something that's more like what you would like to do.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:01.280]   You probably had some deep-seated desire to want to help people gain their health.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.460]   And that's the common thread that you are finding between personal finance and working
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.440]   as a doctor, is wanting to help people improve their health.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.200]   In one sense, their physical health, in another sense, their financial health.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.640]   That's probably a common thread.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.320]   So my guess is you haven't lost this past – you're still the same person that you
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   were a decade past, but you just learned that there are some aspects of your job and your
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.320]   business that are no longer suitable to you.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   And you know what?
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.640]   The same thing happens to financial advisors.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:39.280]   Financial advisors may start in one company, in one format, one style of practice, and
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.840]   they get into that and they learn.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.560]   And then they have to realize, "You know what?
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.540]   Where I started isn't exactly still the best place for me to be."
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.100]   And they have to adjust and they have to move from one style of practice to a different
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.100]   style of practice.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.280]   This is normal for every career.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:01.340]   So I encourage you, spend a lot of time thinking and searching for a solution that is going
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:07.400]   to – that might be a little simpler than to make this dramatic transition.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.480]   I'm not saying to deny your interest in something else.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.720]   I am saying you've got a starting place in the world of a physician that's much
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.480]   stronger than you do as a financial advisor.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:26.800]   There is practically no transference of skill or background or ability to change from a
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.080]   physician to a financial advisor.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.120]   There's really nothing that goes with you except the fact that you're a physician.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.520]   And that might help you a little bit to perhaps if you wanted to work with other physicians
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.640]   in financial planning, which by the way I don't necessarily recommend because it's
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.480]   probably the most competitive place.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.960]   So it might help you a little bit to understand what a physician is going through.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.120]   But it's not going to help you nearly as much as if say you wanted to get involved
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:59.280]   in building some – opening some new urgent care facilities there in your town.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.280]   And there you've got the background in medicine and you can add on the experience of business.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.660]   Or if you wanted to develop a consulting group of some kind or if you wanted to transition
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.600]   and let's say you're looking for a life of adventure and you want to go be a physician
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.780]   for Doctors Without Borders and travel to war zones and help people in that context
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.620]   and you don't make as much money or any money but you now can use those skills of
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.880]   being a physician to still pursue that primary passion.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.420]   I don't know what it is.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:31.000]   My only point is that you've got a strong foundation to build on.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.840]   And the example that I would draw for you would be look at why I'm able to speak effectively
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.680]   here in Radical Personal Finance.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.880]   It's because of the background that I have.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.400]   It's because I'm an authority in this area because of my experience.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.520]   Now does that mean that I couldn't go and build a podcast on parenting?
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.280]   Of course not.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.640]   I'm doing that.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.200]   But I'll tell you I don't have really any credentials in that area.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.320]   And so there's a totally different approach.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:12.580]   Now I still like doing it but I was confident transitioning to Radical Personal Finance
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.280]   as a business venture.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:19.280]   I would not be confident transitioning to being some kind of parenting guru as a business
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.420]   venture.
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:27.000]   So there may very well be an opportunity for you in the medical field that would fit some
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.320]   of the things that you're looking for and I would encourage you practice zero-based
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.840]   thinking.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.680]   But don't throw away who you actually are or what you actually have because there's
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:44.360]   this relationship there between not being overwhelmed by the past but recognizing what
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.720]   you now have from the past.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:55.960]   You need to draw those things forward and use those strengths, those leverages.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.640]   So if we were using and thinking about the concept of the sunk cost, accounting term,
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.800]   we spent money on an investment project and we lost the money.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.680]   Yes, we have to write that money off as gone.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.560]   We're not going to consider it any longer.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   It's gone.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.560]   It's sunk.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.560]   It's dead.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.800]   But we're not going to lose the lessons from it.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.920]   We're not going to lose the learnings from it.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.440]   We're not going to lose the experience that we've gained.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.320]   We're not going to lose the insights that we've gained.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.580]   We may have sunk a million dollars into some kind of research project and we may not get
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.480]   nearly a million dollars worth of benefit out of it.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480]   So it's a sunk cost.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.800]   We can't worry about it.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.560]   But we better use the results from that research project in today's world.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.160]   Your career is no different.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:42.800]   You better use those things that continue in you, whatever it is, the care, the medical
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.400]   authority, whatever it is, bring those things forward.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.360]   And don't be scared to make a dramatic change but recognize the value that you have from
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.160]   that experience and from that learnings.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.360]   So let's talk about the – becoming a financial advisor.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:04.080]   And here I'm going to describe the path that I took because the word "financial
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.640]   advisor" is a very general nebulous term.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.880]   There's lots of companies you could join.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.980]   Every company has a different perspective.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.840]   So you can join a big company.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.940]   You can join a little company.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.320]   You can join an established company.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.220]   You can join a non-established company.
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.520]   You can join a company where you run your own deal from day one.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.160]   You can join as a junior advisor under a team.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.560]   You can focus on investments.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.000]   You can focus on insurance.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.900]   You can focus on a specific niche specialty.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.900]   So there's all kinds of things.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.280]   I'm going to specifically answer the question that you asked me, which was, "Joshua,
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.600]   what was your personal experience with this type of approach?"
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.560]   Meaning a large traditional insurance company which has transitioned into a comprehensive
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.520]   financial services company.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.760]   And what did you learn from that?
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.760]   Pros and cons.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.720]   You said, "What are the pros and cons?"
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.320]   Well, the best thing about the financial advisor business – and this is what really drew
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:05.720]   me to it – was you can build your own business from day one without having to come up with
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.240]   a product or an idea.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:15.640]   So the lingo – if I were engaged in recruiting you, I would use words like, "You're in
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.000]   business for yourself."
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.160]   I'd say, "You're in business for yourself but not by yourself."
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.160]   And you know what?
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.840]   That is absolutely true.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:30.280]   As a financial advisor in the path that I took, you're in business for yourself.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.560]   I was in a situation where nobody told me when to come in, nobody told me when to leave.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.280]   That's really powerful.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.600]   And I knew that I wanted to be an entrepreneur.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.640]   I knew that I didn't want my income to be tied to my time.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.160]   I knew that.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.400]   And so I was looking for an entrepreneurial opportunity but I didn't have a specific
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.360]   idea that I could implement.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.680]   I didn't have an X-grade idea for a cool shoe company that I wanted to make.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.320]   I didn't have an idea for a cool ballroom dancing storefront thing that I wanted to
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   open.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.740]   I didn't have an idea.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:10.320]   So I had the opportunity to use somebody else's products, somebody else's ideas,
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.800]   but to build and run my own business.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.200]   And that was really, really valuable.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.680]   The great thing about insurance and investments as a business is you don't have to stock the
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.640]   shelves.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.160]   You can have world-class companies that keep the inventory.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.920]   You can have world-class insurance companies and they're responsible to make sure that
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.860]   the policies work as advertised.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.720]   World-class investment managers and they're responsible to make sure the funds work as
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   advertised.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.720]   That's awesome.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.600]   It's really, really awesome.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:51.080]   Another great pro of the business is you can be in business with a minimal financial investment.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:56.900]   If I were going to go and open a storefront in my hometown here, some kind of brick and
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:02.680]   mortar business, I would need to have a significant amount of capital ready to spend in the initial
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.400]   opening stages of that business.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.800]   Buying the space, adjusting the decorations, buying inventory, hiring employees, there's
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.640]   a lot of money that's needed for that.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:21.320]   Well, when opening a financial advisory practice, there's really no money.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.400]   You don't have to pay anything out of pocket.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.840]   Usually the companies that are recruiting you, they'll cover most of your initial expenses.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.320]   Your initial expenses are low.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:34.040]   The only real financial risk is that you need to be able to cover your personal expenses
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.840]   during the startup period.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.440]   If your personal expenses are low and minimal, then that could be a very reasonable sum.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.920]   If you're trying to cover $15,000 a month for the first year, that's a less reasonable
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.920]   sum.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.600]   But you can control those things.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.120]   Your financial risk is minimal.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:58.680]   That's a powerful, powerful strategy to be able to – it's powerful.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:06.480]   I am to this day convinced for somebody who was starting with few advantages, this world,
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.920]   being a financial advisor, selling insurance, selling investments, helping people with their
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:16.640]   financial planning, this is one of the best opportunities to establish a business with
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.280]   huge upside potential with very little financial risk.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.680]   So it's a powerful, powerful opportunity.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.660]   The pro of the business is that it's very, very established.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.320]   For example, the company I was with, I mean, they've been in business for – since what,
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   1857?
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.680]   So 160-ish years basically.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.000]   They know how to do their business.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.760]   It's established.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.320]   You almost can't ask a new question.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.640]   You almost can't come up with a new system.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:51.120]   The system has been proven again and again and again and again.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.360]   So all you got to do is just do what you're told.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:00.000]   In the years that I was working in the business, I never saw a single person who did what they
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.480]   were told fail.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.000]   That's powerful.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.400]   It's like the benefits of opening a franchise as compared to the benefits of opening your
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   own business.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.520]   If I were going to open a restaurant, man, I would seriously, seriously consider opening
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.680]   a franchise if I could afford the franchise fee.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.080]   In the most valuable thing of a franchise is somebody gives you, yes, the brand, but
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.320]   they give you the operations manuals.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.920]   They tell you how to run the business.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:36.360]   A good franchise, they've got all kinds of – they've worked it all out for you.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.840]   That's powerful.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.480]   Personal story, I delivered pizzas for a week in a Papa John's store.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.560]   I did it because I thought that delivering pizzas might make enough money for me to be
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.160]   a Segway job.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.600]   But it's not.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.920]   It's not a profitable use of time.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.600]   But I also was excited to do it because I thought it would be fun to work in a franchise
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.600]   model.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.520]   This wasn't the major reason I did it, but I knew there would be some ancillary benefits
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.720]   which is why I was willing to do it for a week.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.560]   I'll tell you, the biggest thing that I – one of the biggest things I learned, it
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.680]   was a cool experience.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.840]   I had never previously worked in a minimum wage type of job.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.360]   I had never previously worked with people who were just kind of just applying for a
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.360]   job.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.960]   I'd always worked in mostly skilled jobs.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.040]   By the way, there's a lot of skill in spinning pizza dough.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.560]   I never figured that one out.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   I tried.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.400]   They tried to teach me, but I wasn't there long enough to learn that.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.180]   But I never – so I had – it was a cool opportunity for me.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:32.240]   But one of the things I noticed was how different the training of the employees was in that
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.760]   venue as compared to what the employees actually did.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.240]   Simple example, the thing I learned in studying the Papa John's training – I'm not a
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   lot.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.080]   I didn't get the franchise or books.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:49.040]   I just noticed that just what the initial training videos I went through is as a delivery
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.560]   driver and that's what I was doing, as a delivery driver, something as simple as you're
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.680]   supposed to call out as you walk out the door the order, what's in it, and whether or
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.600]   not you have – whether or not you have drinks or sides or desserts.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.880]   In the restaurant business, most of the margin that they make is not in the food.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.880]   The margin is in the drinks or the sides or the extra stuff.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.000]   And so for pizza franchise, it's no different.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.360]   Yes, there's going to be some margin in the pizza.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.680]   But if you can buy a two-liter bottle of soda and a dessert and some chicken wings on the
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.480]   side, the margins go up substantially.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.320]   So there's an important focus on upsell and you've got to do it professionally and
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   do it politely.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.240]   But the upsell will make a huge difference in the profit margins.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.400]   So the manual is written to encourage an atmosphere of professional upselling.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.880]   As a delivery driver, you're supposed to go out the door and say, "Two pizzas, one
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.640]   two-liter soda," et cetera, and everyone calls out.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.640]   In that way, the team knows how we're doing as a group.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.680]   So Joshua, I'm a rule follower.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.600]   Okay, here's the training manual.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.800]   This is what I'll do.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.400]   And immediately the first night, I find out that nobody follows the rules.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   Next, I go on a trip with a delivery driver for a trainee and all the rules that were
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.480]   told in the manual in the training video, I find out they're breaking all the rules.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.000]   They're not doing what they're told to do in the training.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.920]   I became convinced after a couple of days, man, all I would have to do to have a pretty
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.120]   good business would be to buy these franchises and actually just replace all the management
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.720]   with people who are actually going to follow the rules because the systems have all been
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.200]   worked out but the people are lazy and the management doesn't require and the managers
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.360]   don't have any financial incentive to make things work and the whole system is broken
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.960]   simply because the rules aren't followed.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.000]   So I draw that as a parallel to the same thing in the financial advisory business.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.760]   The pros are that you're given the playbook.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.680]   You're given the scripts.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.560]   You're given all the solutions.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.400]   All you got to do is do it.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.040]   A lot of pros.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.480]   Other quick pros, it's a flexible business.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.520]   You can have control over your time.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.280]   I always found that to be valuable.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.240]   One of my highest priorities is freedom, freedom and flexibility.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.680]   I don't like to say no to things because I don't have the time.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.280]   I don't like to go and ask a boss for, you know, can I have this day off or can I have
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.480]   five days off?
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.560]   That's a higher value for me than money.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.720]   I'll take less pay and more flexibility every time if I have to choose one over the other.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.720]   So those are some pros.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.080]   Now, as far as the cons, there are many.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.920]   There are many cons.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:32.080]   You know, a con for you personally, you're going to go from a fairly respected position
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:38.020]   and status in society to a fairly disrespected status and position in society.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.160]   You got to be emotionally okay with that.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.360]   Now, I'm not saying that being a financial advisor is disrespected, but in the initial
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.200]   stages where you're just learning, it's a pretty low status occupation.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   Why is it?
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.200]   I don't know.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.200]   Should it be?
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   I don't think so.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.040]   Cons, you got to work a lot.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.640]   It is a tough, tough, tough business to get to.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.120]   You have to work a lot.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:12.000]   And some of the cons, especially of the business structure, there are a couple that are important.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:20.800]   First, although you're in business for yourself, and that's a good thing, it also means you're
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.000]   in business for yourself.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.240]   So once you get things established, you've got to go on and generally you've got to hire
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.240]   your own staff.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.360]   You got to rent your own office space.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.420]   You've got to build your own little business.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.480]   And one of the biggest cons though is that doesn't come with all the freedom that you
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.040]   would get if you were truly in business for yourself.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.560]   Not only is the financial advisory business itself highly regulated, just like the practice
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   of medicine, highly regulated at a federal and a state level, lots and lots of rules
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:27:01.280]   about what you can and can't do, but in working with a big company, they are extremely inflexible.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.280]   Extremely inflexible.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.980]   Now, do I fault them for that?
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.920]   I don't, because if I were running one of these huge companies, I have a responsibility
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:17.980]   to my policy owners to make sure that things are – that our affairs are conducted circumspectly.
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.180]   And how do you do that?
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.100]   Well, you keep lots of rules in force and you enforce them.
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:27.880]   You can't open yourself up to unnecessary threats of litigation.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.180]   But that also means that there's going to be a lot of control from the top.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:37.820]   So yes, you get the flexibility of come and go as you like to a certain extent, but you
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:42.960]   don't get any flexibility of being able to be creative with your approaches to marketing
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.300]   your product.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.940]   You don't get any flexibility to be able to build any kind of meaningful media.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:53.620]   That was the straw that broke my back was I said – and I still believe this, that
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:59.280]   in many ways, the traditional financial services business, they are – they're shooting
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.780]   themselves in the foot.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:06.460]   There's no meaningful marketing that's actually bringing people in the door.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:12.100]   The years that I worked in the industry, I never got any meaningfully useful leads and
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.420]   the leads that I did get I grew to despise.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.020]   And by – despise is not – forgive me for that.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:22.580]   I don't mean to despise the person, but I grew to see that the leads were not valuable
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.580]   leads.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.520]   Usually when someone would call into the local insurance office and say, "Hey, I'm shopping
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.860]   for life insurance," what they're doing is they're calling around for quotes and
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.900]   quotes are a very poor way of selling.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.540]   Personally, I don't generally ever want to be in the low-cost business.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.900]   I want to be in the high-value business.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.580]   And the company that I was with, he never had the cheapest insurance, never.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.940]   Now, I don't think necessarily that everyone should want to have the cheapest insurance.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.940]   So I always had to try to – I always had to quote the cheap ones because people are
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.580]   price-sensitive to try to figure out what is the opportunity and is the more expensive
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.140]   models of policy, are they appropriate?
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.140]   And by cheap, I'm not talking about policy design.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.480]   You got to figure out what policy design is appropriate.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.540]   But I am talking about just the specific company.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.100]   In some things, you get what you pay for.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.600]   In most things in life.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.180]   And the differences are small, but it goes – but it does remain – the fact remains
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.460]   that we were never the cheapest.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.400]   So when I get a call, I get a lead, somebody is shopping around, I mean I would call them
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.900]   back to try to do a good job.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:26.540]   But I can't remember – I remember selling a couple of policies to inbound leads, but
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:31.020]   generally those policies would fall off the books and that's even more destructive to
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.020]   your compensation.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.380]   So I grew to dislike that.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.860]   That was very different than me going out and finding a client, establishing the value,
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.660]   establishing the process and everything up front.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:46.980]   So just like the franchise model where you get a lot of good things about it, you get
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:52.940]   the subway sign, you get the subway manual, you get the subway forms and documents and
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.940]   standard procedures.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:01.540]   But you can't all of a sudden take the green sign and turn it blue.
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.940]   And you might reach a point at which you want to do that.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.060]   That's very frustrating.
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:10.540]   That's probably the biggest con of the business.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.940]   What kind of income can I expect and within how long?
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:23.440]   These numbers range significantly depending on your background and experience.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.900]   You can get these actual numbers from the company that you're recruiting with.
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.300]   They'll give you the actual numbers.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:36.780]   I believe in my first year I made something like $40,000 in my first year.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:42.260]   The challenge is that everything about the financial advisor business, everything is
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.260]   deferred.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:51.580]   And it's simply deferred due to the length of the sales cycle, also the wholesale's process,
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.420]   the challenge of finding new customers.
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:31:00.160]   If I were to start with the simplest thing, let's go with the simplest, easiest sale of
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.340]   all time, a simple life insurance policy.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.060]   You're 31 years old.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.780]   You're working with a fellow physician.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:13.420]   This physician decides that they need some term life insurance or you talk with them.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.500]   They need some term life insurance and some disability insurance.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:22.620]   Here is the basic sales cycle of that process.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.620]   You call up your buddy.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.620]   You say, "Hey, listen.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.420]   I just got into the financial planning business.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.900]   I'd like to sit down with you and talk to you about finances."
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.900]   He says, "All right.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.340]   Well, it takes you a week to get him on the phone because he's busy.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.140]   He's working from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. too."
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.140]   He says, "Okay.
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.140]   That'd be fine.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.140]   It takes you a week to get him on the phone."
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.140]   So there's one week.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.580]   Then you set an appointment for the following week.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.100]   There's two weeks.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.100]   You go out for that appointment.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.620]   You do what we would call a fact-finding appointment, which is you find out about his goals.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.660]   You find out about his needs.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.660]   You find out about his assets.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:54.900]   You find out everything that he has so that you can make a professional suggestion or
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.460]   recommendation of what he needs.
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.620]   That takes a week.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.100]   You tell him you're going to get back with him the following week.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.580]   Let's assume that he keeps that appointment the following week.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.580]   That's now your three weeks.
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.060]   You come back together with him.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.860]   You put together a simple basic financial plan, which you present to him.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:15.120]   You also go ahead and present to him a simple recommendation for some life insurance.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.180]   You cannot – generally, you're going to have to be stretched out because most people
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.300]   have an attention span of a few minutes.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.780]   But if you get beyond 45 minutes or an hour as far as one of these types of meetings,
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.900]   you're too much.
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.460]   And so if you're going to present a financial plan, that's going to take the whole meeting
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.180]   and you might barely get to talk about term life insurance.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.180]   Pretty simple.
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.460]   You're not going to get to life insurance and disability insurance.
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:39.820]   So let's say you're at three weeks now.
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.140]   You present the financial plan.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:48.540]   The next week, you come back and you go over how a simple term life insurance policy would
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.540]   work.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.540]   You make some recommendations.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   "Hey, I think you need 2 million.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.420]   I think you need 2 million for your wife."
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.540]   He goes ahead and says yes.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.660]   You're at four weeks now.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.340]   You go ahead and fill out applications.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.100]   You submit those applications to the home office.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.260]   The home office is going to take three or four weeks to get the policy done.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.780]   They got to get the medical records in.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.300]   They got to get all the information in.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:12.120]   So now we go from four weeks to seven weeks.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.540]   Then you go ahead and call your buddy for a delivery appointment eight weeks and you
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.660]   get paid sometime around the time that you deliver the policy depending on how it's
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.660]   structured.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.900]   So there's about an eight-week process there.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.900]   Now could it happen that fast?
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.220]   Well, in theory, does it happen that fast?
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.700]   Almost never because what happens?
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:33.060]   It takes you a week to get your buddy on the phone and you schedule an appointment.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.380]   But that week, he gets called in late because he's the junior guy and he's got to cancel
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.380]   that appointment or his wife had a tough day and so they canceled the appointment.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.220]   So the next week, he comes in.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.500]   You come in for that meeting.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.500]   You have a good meeting.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.140]   You have a financial planning meeting.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.380]   You go and present the financial plan.
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.560]   You're supposed to get together the following week to talk about life insurance, but he's
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   busy that week.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.920]   Okay, can't do it.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.620]   Another week goes by, busy that week.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.820]   Okay, you go ahead and finally get back together with him and say, "Okay, this is really good.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.460]   We need to think about it," as he should.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.380]   Okay, it takes a week, two weeks.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.460]   Finally you call him up and say, "Listen, buddy, are you going to get together?
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.460]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.620]   We really want to get some term life insurance."
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.380]   Okay, you go ahead and get together with him.
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.740]   You fill out applications.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.500]   The doctor doesn't return the medical records in time.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.060]   He's got to all of a sudden, they're reading through one thing and he's got some kind of
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.060]   weird heart things.
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.980]   They got to track down the cardiologist to get this and it just, the point goes on and
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.220]   on and on.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.340]   Now the challenge of that, that's a perfect situation.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.380]   So you can see the challenge of getting a business going.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.780]   It's going to take you eight, 10, 12, 15 weeks from the beginning.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:35.100]   But the next big challenge is the ratio, the number of people that you will talk to as
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.220]   compared to the number of people that will actually buy something from you.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:42.780]   Here I'm just talking about insurance because the insurance is the fast sales.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:48.360]   Investments are very slow, whether that's a sale of a mutual fund or whether that's
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:52.060]   the management transfer of accounts.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.080]   It takes much longer generally for someone to say, "Hey, let me transfer to you a million
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.420]   dollar account," than it does to say, "Let me buy a couple million bucks of term life
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.420]   insurance.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.420]   I know I need it.
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.420]   They've been bugging me about it.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.420]   I'll go ahead and get it."
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.380]   So you should stick with insurance.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.940]   The numbers of people that you are going to reach out to, we always talk about it, is
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.820]   with the company I was with, it was built upon the work of a man named Al Granum who
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.620]   was an incredible life insurance agent out of Chicago.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:24.540]   He built something they call the Granum system, G-R-A-N-U-M, an incredible book called Building
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.900]   a Financial Services Clientele, which was the manual that I used from.
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.780]   It's the franchise model that I built everything in my business from.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:36.060]   But he would talk about a ratio of what we affectionately called 10-3-1, which means
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.420]   that for every 10 referrals that I would get, I'll cover that in a little bit, every 10
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.340]   referrals that you get, I call those 10 people for an appointment.
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.980]   Of those 10 people that I would call, remember it takes time to get people on the phone,
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.980]   which is the biggest issue I think that's happening right now in the financial services
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.980]   business.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.540]   Very few people want to answer their phone anymore, so it takes time to get people on
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.060]   the phone.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.060]   And especially the better people, it's even harder to get people on the phone.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.420]   Just consider yourself.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.780]   How much do you answer the phone between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.?
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.300]   The answer is you don't.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.220]   Not a bit.
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.580]   Not a bit.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.820]   But call 10 people.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.180]   You reach 10 people on the phone and you ask them for an appointment.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:21.380]   Of those 10 people, if you're good, 5 of them will meet with you, take an appointment of
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.380]   some kind.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.860]   The 5 that meet with you, 3 of them will share all the information about their financial
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.020]   lives with you and they'll have some kind of need, something that they're trying to
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:36.100]   figure out and the financial need is broad, some area of input that you can help them
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.100]   on.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:43.860]   Of those 3 that share all that information with you, 1 of them will buy from you at some
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.220]   point over a 3-year period.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.360]   And that's what's so startling.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.880]   They know because they've tracked it.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.500]   What they find out is you need to follow up with people for about 3 years because 60%
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:01.260]   of your actual sales will come in the first 12 months of meeting somebody, 30% will come
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:07.060]   in the 12 months, 12 through 24, and 10% will come in months 24 through 36.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.020]   So if we were to talk with actual numbers, let's just stick with 1,000, you're going
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.140]   to reach out to 1,000 people in your first year.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.500]   You actually need to do it higher to be at the proper numbers.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:22.220]   It's going to be about 1,200 to 1,600 people depending on how hardcore you are.
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.380]   1,200 to 1,400 is about 120 a month in the first year.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.380]   But you're going to reach 1,000 people.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.060]   Of those 1,000 people, you're going to have 500 appointments.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.340]   Of those 500 appointments, 300 people are going to share with you all the details of
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.380]   their lives.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:40.820]   Of those 300, only 100 are going to buy, 60 of them are going to buy in the first year,
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:45.980]   30 of them in the second year, and 10 in the third year.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.640]   This ratio is both your enemy and your friend.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.940]   It's your enemy in the beginning, which is why it's so difficult to get started in the
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.960]   financial services business.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:04.300]   It takes so much work to get things established and many people aren't willing to put in the
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.920]   work.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.420]   So it takes a lot of work in the beginning.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.780]   You're very underpaid in the beginning, overworked and underpaid.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.900]   But it's your friend because once you build this system and you're talking to thousands
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.540]   and thousands of people and you build a system for following up with them, they respect you,
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:28.180]   they appreciate you, what happens is that when the time is right and people feel like
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:32.160]   they're in a position where they can go ahead and make significant financial decisions,
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.980]   to go ahead and do the financial plan, to go ahead and open the college account, to
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.380]   go ahead and buy the life insurance policy, to go ahead and transfer the old IRA or whatever
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:47.720]   it is, once you have built that, then there can be a steady supply of new business.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:52.220]   So as far as the income that you can expect and within how long, you can expect it to
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.740]   be very low for a long period of time.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:00.340]   But on the back end, it can be very profitable.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.920]   So again, I think I made $40,000 my first year.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.720]   That was top quartile.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:10.780]   The other thing you've got to remember is – so that was top quartile, about $40,000.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:11.900]   Then it can grow from there.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:18.300]   I forget the numbers now as far as what the top quartile number is for after three or
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.300]   four or five years.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.100]   But it gets into the $150,000, $100,000, $150,000.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:29.200]   However, how you've got to read through those numbers is you have to recognize that
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.300]   that's gross income for your practice.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.060]   It's not your net profit.
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.580]   That's gross income for your business.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.000]   And so that's where you've got to take those filters and ask – if you're working
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.140]   with a recruiter, ask the recruiter for those sales figures.
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:45.180]   But then you have to filter that through the actual expenses of the business.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.580]   That's the other thing that most people miss.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.360]   Because as you're building this business, if you think about the challenge of reaching
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:57.780]   out and speaking to a thousand people, then it takes quite a lot of work.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.720]   And so you've got to build the business behind it.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.400]   Not only do you have the expenses for renting your office space, you have to start to build
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.720]   up your staff.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.540]   And so now all of a sudden in the third year, you're going to add on staff salaries of
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:15.240]   say $30,000 plus all the other expenses or $40,000 or however you structure it.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.720]   And now you've got to take expenses out.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.760]   And when you're going through this traditional systematic process of building a business,
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.000]   when you hire an employee, you're always overstaffed right away.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.240]   And then at some point, you're properly staffed.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.160]   And then at some point, you're understaffed and you've got to hire again.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.480]   But you're usually at a period of overcapacity.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.620]   And figuring out how to deal with that overcapacity is challenging.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:41.120]   So what kind of income can you expect and without how long?
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:48.420]   That is largely determined based upon how much you work and how effective you are.
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.440]   The number of people that you connect with, the financial capacity of those people, and
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.020]   how effective you are at working with those people.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.740]   Those are the ratios.
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.040]   So I'm not avoiding the question.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.720]   I'm just simply telling you that the majority of people don't make it at all and they go
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.040]   out of the business without ever building it themselves without ever making it, which
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.960]   we'll come to in a moment, why don't people make it.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.580]   But then some people can make six figures in their first couple of years.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.800]   Some people can make multiple six figures.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:24.000]   Usually, however, the people that can make multiple six figures in the first few years
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:32.360]   are people with some other background, experience, connections, network, some unique characteristic
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.520]   that helps them to be successful.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.840]   There's no doubt in my mind that if I were to go back and start from scratch, I didn't
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.240]   have access to any of my former clients, friends, anything like that.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.240]   I just went back to the company I was with and I started completely from scratch.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:54.680]   From what I know now, I mean, I don't want to be overly optimistic, but no doubt I could
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.880]   do six figures in the first year and I would say multiple six figures, but that's because
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.880]   I'm not a newbie anymore.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.680]   And that's what's so challenging about the start of it is imagine if you were thrown
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:13.600]   into the practice of medicine without years of medical school and without years of residency.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.640]   That's challenging enough to be a new physician with medical school and with residency, right?
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.240]   Now imagine you were thrown right into business on day one without all those years of experience
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.840]   because it doesn't take much to get started in the financial advisor business.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.480]   All you need is a couple of licenses.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.320]   You need an insurance license.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.320]   That's a week of class and pass a test and you need an investments license and that's
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:39.920]   a week of class and pass a test depending on how good you are as a student, how familiar
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.280]   you are with financial terms.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:48.280]   Just a couple of tests, series seven, 63, series six, series 65, depending on the structure
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.480]   that you're going in.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.720]   So those things are, they're minimal requirements.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.960]   I mean, it's laughable with regard to the experience and expertise is laughable compared
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.360]   to what a professional physician has to do to even to get a license.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.000]   And this is one of the things that people are trying to change, but you don't really
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.040]   need that much to hang yourself out as a financial advisor.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.640]   But as far as your actual experience, you hardly know anything.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.240]   So you've got to learn how to run a business.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.320]   You've got to learn how to use sales language.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.400]   You've got to learn how to effectively gather facts.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.740]   You've got to learn financial planning.
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:24.000]   All those things take years and years.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.760]   So if I were to go back and do it today, it's not the system that's the problem.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.360]   It's the fact of having the knowledge, knowing how it works, having good sales language,
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:38.320]   knowing how to connect with people, having all the soft skills and the hard financial
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:43.280]   planning skills and the discipline and the work ethic and all those other things.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.960]   So some people come into that very prepared for it.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.280]   Some people come into it very unprepared for it.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.920]   So that's the real story is that it's largely in many ways up to you.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.800]   Now as far as the long-term income potential, the long-term income potential of being a
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.540]   financial advisor is tremendous.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:03.920]   And after you build that foundation, after you build that large practice, after you've
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.700]   found your specialty, after you've found your platform, you can dramatically pull back
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.840]   on the work.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.400]   You can dramatically pull back on the effort.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.800]   But you can keep the very profitable business there.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   Because once somebody buys from you once, they'll go on to buy from you throughout a
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.980]   lifetime.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:26.440]   And if you think about the number of financial products and the amount of financial advice
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.560]   that somebody like you, an attorney – excuse me, a physician is going to need throughout
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.520]   their lifetime, it's huge.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.240]   It's massive.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:41.400]   And so if you can become a trusted advisor for a number of people, that can be really,
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.640]   really valuable.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:48.160]   The business model that I latched onto was I knew when I was 23 years old, I didn't
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:52.920]   have the interest or the experience that I felt like somebody was at 23 years old going
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.320]   to write over their million-dollar portfolio to me.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.920]   I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.440]   But I knew I could sell insurance.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.800]   And I knew I could do that effectively.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.800]   I could learn it.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.880]   I could feel confident with it.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.160]   I could help people.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:10.160]   And so the model that I grasped that worked for me was – and the other thing, I didn't
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.920]   want to be a junior advisor.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.080]   I didn't want to have a job.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.600]   I wanted a business.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:20.320]   So I knew if I build an insurance, that allows me to meet hundreds, even thousands of people.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:24.180]   I'll build a strong client base with hundreds and hundreds of clients.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.740]   And then I can go through that client base and I can keep the choice clients, the clients
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:33.040]   that have big potential for the long term, big financial potential.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.960]   I can keep those clients very close to me.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.400]   And little by little, the other clients will just drift away.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.840]   And then I'll build this very, very solid practice of that base of clients that's
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.320]   really strong.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:52.560]   My target for me, the sweet spot that I decided, I wanted 100 households that were middle 40s
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.960]   to 60s, retirement planning, a million bucks a household.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.900]   That was the plan that I was working on.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:00.900]   So you can adjust.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.780]   Now, there's lots of other ways to run the business, but you can adjust.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.900]   Next question you asked, what was a day like for you?
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:12.700]   Well, in the beginning, I started at 7 a.m. usually, 7, 7.30.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:19.100]   And usually, I would come into the office at work for an hour, a couple hours, doing
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.640]   case preparation, doing studying, doing those things early in the morning.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:26.260]   We had a thing that we used in our business called golden hours.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:31.700]   And the idea was basically from about 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., those were golden hours.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.740]   And so the rule, if you wanted to be successful and make it in the early years, those golden
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:40.100]   hours, you do not do office work during those golden hours.
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:48.860]   I use the word working to refer to either sitting face to face with clients or prospective
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:55.340]   clients, or as my managing director said, the words ringing in my ears, fighting to
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.780]   get face to face with clients or prospective clients, which means picking up the phone
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.180]   and calling people.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:05.500]   And so generally, I would schedule appointments.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.860]   And I tried to work from a specific calendar.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:15.740]   Our rules when I was starting was that you had to have – going into a week, you had
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.300]   to have a minimum of 25 appointments scheduled.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:23.540]   And if you had 25 appointments scheduled, you would wind up keeping about 15 of them.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.740]   When you actually have physical face to face appointments scheduled, almost in the first
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.660]   couple of years, about 50% of them cancel.
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:34.340]   In later years, it drops down below that as you have to start to work with clients who
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:35.820]   are more established.
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.820]   Your keep ratio changes significantly.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:45.380]   So I would have appointments scheduled at 10 a.m., 11.30 a.m., 1 o'clock p.m., 2.30
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.980]   and 4 o'clock p.m.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.560]   That would give me a total of five opportunities to meet with people.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.760]   And I would do that five days a week, so that would give me 25 slots.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:59.840]   So if I was in the office from 7 till 9, I'd pick up the phone, 8.30 or 9, phone for an
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:00.840]   hour.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.960]   Often we'd have a sales meeting once a week or other training things in the morning.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:11.000]   But then after those, starting at 9, you'd phone from 9 till 10 or 8.30 to 9.30, something
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.160]   like that, and go to your first appointment at 10 o'clock.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.680]   Once you start to get effective, what you actually learn to do is usually double book.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.320]   So you try to double book a few of those appointments, which means you have two appointments scheduled
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:25.120]   at 10, two appointments scheduled at 11.30, or two appointments scheduled at 1.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:30.500]   You don't have usually all of them scheduled, but you wind up to really be effective.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:36.780]   Often I've seen for a while I was there myself, and then sometimes I would taper off, which
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.160]   is my biggest weakness.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:44.600]   But you wind up with 30 to 35 appointments, basically about 30 appointments scheduled
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.600]   during those times.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.520]   And you definitely try to constrict them to a certain number of days.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.200]   So you know that two appointments and one of them almost always cancels.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.680]   So that way you can actually keep appointments at those times.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:59.000]   And so from 9 a.m. till 5 p.m., you're either face-to-face with somebody, driving to get
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.720]   face-to-face with them, or you are on the phone calling more people, calling, scheduling
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.200]   appointments, rescheduling appointments.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   You're scrambling.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.180]   Then you get back to the office, 5 o'clock on.
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.600]   This one you do your case preparation.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.960]   You work to build your financial plans.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.320]   You build your proposals, do all of those things.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.800]   And then also don't forget you've got to study.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.880]   So you wind up studying at night.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:25.040]   You wind up working on your CFP classes or your CLU classes and doing all of that.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.880]   So I mean there were many times you're learning software.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.120]   You're learning how your financial planning program works.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.120]   It was standard for me.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:36.800]   I would leave the office more than once or twice a week, leave the office at 10, 11 o'clock.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.240]   A lot of reps go home.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.600]   If you have family, it's very challenging to go home, spend time with your family over
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.440]   dinner and then after you put the kids to bed, then you're working for two, three more
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.580]   hours doing all your prep for the next day.
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.680]   It's an exhausting business.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.360]   It's an exhausting business.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.640]   It's a lot of work.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.560]   And so that's an average day.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.020]   Now you compare that and that's a day in the first couple of years.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.840]   On the backside, what's an average day once you've been in the business 15 years and you've
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:07.520]   got several tens of thousands of dollars of monthly revenue that's coming in regardless
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.860]   and you've got staff that runs all your financial plans and all you've got to do is show up
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:15.880]   for your meetings and you've got highly qualified clients and prospective clients who all have
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.000]   relationships with you.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.600]   So your keep ratio is very high.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.160]   You can do everything in three days a week, three or four days a week.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.760]   So you can get there and that's where it's hard to describe an average day unless you
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.340]   look at both ends.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:33.000]   So you do all the work up front for the backside.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.400]   When did you really start taking off with your career there?
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.920]   So first, I would say about three years.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.040]   After about three years, everything started to click.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:47.760]   I actually quit after three years to go and do something else.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.280]   Quit for about two months and then I went back and continued.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.320]   And then after about four or five years, everything started to change.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:51:00.080]   Because what happens is you start to go and make a transition from being that new person
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.760]   who's doing a new thing that no one really knows about to being an established, respected
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.560]   financial advisor where people start to call you instead of you having to call everyone
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.560]   else.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:15.240]   So three, four, five years was kind of the real change and then I remember I left after
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.240]   six.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.200]   I really pulled back substantially.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.600]   I didn't really work much my last year.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:26.040]   I just kind of kept things going because I knew I was going to be making a transition
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.120]   and I took plenty of time off in there.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.360]   I was a top quartile rep my first couple of years and then I drifted back further in the
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:36.200]   pack because I take too much time off.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.160]   Do a lot of people not make it?
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.400]   Correct.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:46.560]   I think if memory is right, about 80% of the people who sign up to become a new financial
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:52.440]   services person, financial rep, financial advisor, about 80% are gone after five years.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.040]   Some companies it's 10% are still there.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.880]   Some companies it's 20% but around those numbers.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:02.280]   And this really hurts the industry because so many people come in and so many people
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:08.040]   leave that it leaves people with an impression that advisors are very flighty.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.000]   And that's really, really I think it's a bad thing that happens.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.480]   They work really hard.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.480]   All these companies work really hard to try to recruit good people.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:20.600]   But what happens is it's hard without actually being in the business to know whether or not
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.480]   it's a business that's for you.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.840]   So some of those people leave because they don't want to be in the business.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.520]   Some of them leave just simply for a different practice structure.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.920]   So I described the practice model that I've done.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.160]   But you don't have to do that practice model.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.320]   There are other ways.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:39.560]   For example, you could become – I've tried to interview other financial advisors who
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.680]   started.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.840]   And if you were to talk with Alan Moore and all the people at XY Planning Network, none
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:52.120]   of those advisors who are pursuing that system, none of them are doing what I did, talking
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.400]   to a thousand people.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:59.960]   They're focused on establishing themselves as well-marketed in a specific niche.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.560]   So they have a very different view of it.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.380]   They have a very different experience.
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:10.220]   You may have advisors who come in and who are able to focus on years of education where
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.560]   they can transition in at a very high level.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:18.360]   There are as many different practice styles and models as there are companies and people.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:22.440]   So I'm just describing my experience, which is what you specifically asked for in your
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.760]   note.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:29.040]   But it all depends on having the right fit for the right person.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:34.940]   The company that you're with matters, but the office that you're in matters far more.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:39.620]   So what can happen, especially in the insurance-focused companies, is you can have some companies
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:43.140]   that take the holistic financial planning approach.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.140]   My office did.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.940]   I had worked under two managing directors that took a comprehensive approach.
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:51.580]   We didn't have this hardcore – what's that?
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.140]   Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross thing.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.060]   We didn't have the boilerplate sales room.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.180]   You know, "Get the policies.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.260]   Get sling the policies."
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.620]   We had a financial planning culture.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:03.900]   I never realized really how unique that was until much later in my career and all of a
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.300]   sudden I found out that not all offices were that way.
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:11.060]   And so you'll have – for example, I know that Michael Kitsis has been on the show,
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:14.340]   one of the leading pundits on the financial advisor business.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.860]   He started in an insurance office and he just – he failed out of it.
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:21.220]   He did not work in that high-volume business.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:28.220]   He worked well in the very intense, very complicated, in-depth business and he had to find a way
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:29.860]   to the right fit for him.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.860]   That was also the same thing that was my issue.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:38.340]   The people who are the most effective in the scenario that I described are those who have
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:44.600]   the ability to keep their head down and just to focus on finding one type of business and
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.620]   one consistent thing over time.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:53.340]   My issue, what really dogged me as far as being able to be a star in that type of system
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.220]   was that I get too bored.
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:59.060]   I get utterly bored with that sameness over and over and over again.
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:03.100]   So instead of being able to go out and enthusiastically keep focusing on the same thing, I'm like,
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.100]   "Well, I've been there, done this.
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.540]   I don't really want to do this again."
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.980]   So I want to go on to the next thing.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:11.460]   So I would transition from being the young person specialist to the disability insurance
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:15.380]   expert to – now I want to go and conquer the Spanish-speaking market.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:20.020]   Now I want to move to retirement planning or I want to become an estate planning extraordinaire
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:22.260]   and move to group benefits or whatever.
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.260]   I love to learn.
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:28.580]   And so my personality type does not fit well in that doing the same thing every day, each
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:29.580]   and every day.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:34.300]   So it wasn't a great fit for my personality and I learned that now and I've learned how
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:40.520]   to find something that's a fit for my personality where I like to learn new and different things.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.900]   So that's why a lot of people don't make it.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:42.900]   It's just tough.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.260]   A lot of people are not going to put in the time.
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.580]   A lot of people can't make it financially because of that transition.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:52.100]   If you don't have six months or a year's worth of – six months of expenses to cover
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:56.980]   you during those first six to 12 months, it's tough to make the transition.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.720]   How do you actually make money as an advisor?
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:03.420]   Is it based upon consulting fees, ongoing commissions, upfront fees for selling something?
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:08.060]   Depends on the practice but it also depends on the specific opportunity.
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:11.780]   So the simplest one is with insurance policies.
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:16.260]   So life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance, those are the big three that
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.460]   are done by life insurance companies.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.460]   You can also do health insurance.
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.220]   I had a health insurance license for many years.
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:25.180]   I did a little bit of health insurance here and there until the Affordable Care Act was
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.980]   passed and that destroyed the market and I just pulled out completely.
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.060]   I just got sick and tired of everybody being angry at me because their insurance costs
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.700]   were going up all over the place.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:38.700]   So I focus mainly on life insurance, disability insurance, and long-term care insurance.
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.780]   The way the compensation models work in those types of insurance policies is there is a
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:47.020]   large upfront commission that's based upon the percentage of the first year's worth
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.300]   of premium.
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:52.340]   That varies depending on the product, depending on the company.
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:58.140]   So if it's termed life insurance, depending on the company, it might be 50 percent of
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.620]   the first year commission.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.180]   If it's other companies, it might go up higher.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:07.740]   Some companies will offer 100 percent, 110 percent of the first year commission.
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:12.100]   In some ways, although this is not true across the board, in some ways you can almost judge
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:18.620]   the quality of an insurance product based upon the percentage of the commission simply
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.940]   because it's more cost and that cost has to come from somewhere.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:26.660]   So the commission rates are different with life insurance, term life insurance versus
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.060]   whole life insurance versus universal life insurance.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:32.480]   It's different for disability insurance and long-term care insurance.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.500]   So all those types of policies usually are paid out with a larger upfront commission
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.620]   and that's what keeps you in the business in the first place.
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:44.180]   Then they come with smaller renewals or renewal commissions.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:48.140]   So depending on the company, so for example the company that I was worth, it was 10 years
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:52.180]   of renewal commissions and then 10 years of what they would call persistency fees, so
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.500]   an ongoing base.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.260]   So after a few years, that's why the business gets so much better after a few years.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:02.160]   You can get to the point where you have a few thousand dollars of monthly revenue simply
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.320]   coming in from your renewals.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:07.920]   So you want to do as much upfront business as possible.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.940]   The upfront commissions keep you in the business and keep your bills paid while you're building
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:16.000]   up that renewal base and that renewal base is so valuable because it gives you the financial
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.780]   standing to be able to hire staff.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.980]   You know you can pay them no matter what, to be able to expand, to be able to adjust
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:25.900]   things and it gives you that more passive type of income.
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.460]   For investment products, it's different.
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:31.620]   So for investment products, you have to look to see am I selling a commission-based product
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:35.860]   or am I selling a product that's going to pay me a management fee?
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:41.300]   Depending on that, depending on where you are, that's going to adjust it.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.620]   In some companies, you can sell commission products.
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:48.060]   Commission products are very much the – I don't know if they're – you need to be
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:51.920]   careful because I don't know if they're the minority now, but very few people want
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:57.660]   to buy commission products anymore because there's a loaded mutual funds.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:03.260]   There's such a vast array of high-quality, no-load mutual funds available out there that
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:08.700]   when you're going to sell loaded mutual funds, they're not popular and I'm not
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:13.180]   making here a claim of whether they should or shouldn't be, anything like that.
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:15.660]   I never really did much with that.
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:21.260]   You can work with managing accounts where you are going to be paid a percentage of the
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:25.100]   assets under management and that was the business model that I wanted.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:31.340]   Now, some major change is happening right now with the prospect of a new fiduciary rule.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:36.040]   Under the management by fee, you become a fiduciary of the client and you have a much
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:40.900]   higher standard of care as far as working with the clients on an ongoing basis and you
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:42.700]   need to be compensated for that.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.140]   So that works out well.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:49.060]   At some firms, you can go ahead and charge an upfront fee.
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:52.140]   Now whether you should or shouldn't as far as charging an upfront financial planning
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.500]   fee is a matter of debate.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.700]   Some people like to do their financial planning for free and then make their compensation
[00:59:58.700 --> 00:59:59.860]   in the products.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:01.820]   Some people can charge the fees upfront.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:07.020]   I never got to the point where I was not doing the majority of the financial planning "for
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.020]   free."
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:12.620]   There's nothing for free but where I was just simply doing it without charging for it and
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.260]   my compensation was on the back end with products.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.860]   I always tried to work that – I never got to the point where people were willing to
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.460]   pay me at that stage and I – where I had enough people coming and they were going to
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:26.620]   pay me $3,000 or $4,000 or $5,000 to do a financial plan for them.
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:28.420]   The reason was I didn't have a media platform.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.740]   I didn't have the ability to shop before they buy.
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.140]   I didn't have the experience to where I could do that yet.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.980]   Today I could do it but at that point, I didn't.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:42.660]   So I was working to get it there because I firmly believe that people should pay for
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:49.580]   a financial plan almost every time simply because I would pour hours, hours into carefully
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:53.580]   analyzing and researching somebody's situation, trying to present really, really world-class
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:58.100]   solutions to them and they just treat it like nothing because they didn't have any skin
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.100]   in the game.
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.220]   I grew so sick and tired of doing that.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:08.140]   I became convinced that the best plan was every client pays for a financial plan upfront,
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.140]   period.
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:11.340]   Now, whether they want to implement it with products or whatever, that's totally up
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.340]   to them.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.140]   But they're going to pay for it because I got sick and tired of working for free and
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:20.620]   I got sick and tired of people not perceiving my advice as valuable because they hadn't
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:21.860]   paid for it.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.600]   So your mileage may vary.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.680]   Those are the major approaches and so usually the products – usually the compensation
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.800]   is going to be based upon the products.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.160]   When you work with a diversity of products, here's where I think it is really valuable
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.560]   to work with products.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.120]   First, clients like to pay with commissions out of products.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.440]   People like to do that.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.560]   Now, should they or shouldn't they?
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.440]   Mathematically, they probably shouldn't.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.180]   They could probably get cheaper results just simply paying for advice.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:55.000]   But when you work with a diversity of products, you build up all of these different diverse
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.740]   income streams and that's really powerful.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.580]   So you can have – a lot of people have a health insurance business where they get a
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.420]   couple of thousand dollars a month from health insurance business, some individual health
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.340]   insurance, some group health insurance.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.220]   You can build up each of your lines of revenue.
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.780]   You have life insurance commissions.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.240]   You have disability insurance, long-term care insurance.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.600]   You can put in place some group insurance business.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.180]   You can have investments that you're managing.
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.620]   You have maybe a 401(k) business for some employers you're working with.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.640]   You have an individual investment business.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.380]   You have some financial planning fees that you're doing, straight up financial planning,
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.380]   etc.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.980]   You build these diverse lines of revenue.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:33.480]   That's one of the big pros of the business is it becomes very, very strong on the back
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.660]   end where you have all these great lines of revenue.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:40.540]   And so from a risk perspective, especially when you're diversified with both insurance
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:44.980]   and investments, from a risk perspective, I think you're very, very strong.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:50.960]   That can be a really powerful model for building a great business.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.780]   Do you develop a niche or do everything?
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:57.420]   Well, in the beginning, I did everything and I think most people do everything in the beginning.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:00.580]   Now, could you develop a niche?
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.980]   Well, maybe.
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.900]   So it's possible that your experience as a physician could lead you to a natural fit
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.980]   of working with physicians.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.340]   For me, I would be very slow to do that.
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:15.980]   I never particularly liked working with physicians or attorneys or engineers.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.060]   I don't speak engineer.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:22.300]   I don't speak that detailed, very careful, like $32.67.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.920]   I just say $30 a month.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.380]   So it doesn't work well with my personality.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.200]   And I didn't like working with physicians because I didn't like feeling like people
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:35.540]   wouldn't give me the time of day and not offended at you guys or intending to be offensive.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:38.700]   But I didn't like being treated like just a commodity, just sit here in my office and
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.700]   wait.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.580]   So some of that was probably circumstantial.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.660]   If I had the pressure on me that you guys have on you, I would probably do the same
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:49.000]   thing.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.940]   But also some of it was based upon not just personality.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:58.540]   So I never liked working with physicians and I never particularly liked working with attorneys.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:01.780]   The other thing is these are the most highly prospected areas.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.460]   So I didn't like going where there's competition.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.740]   I liked working with blue-collar business people.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:09.680]   I liked working with just simple people.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.820]   That works for me.
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:15.020]   I think the future is most definitely that you want to have a niche.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.380]   Now getting there can be a challenge.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:19.020]   So in the beginning, you don't know what that niche is.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:22.940]   The niche can be based upon working with a certain type of people.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:28.340]   I work with blue-collar business owners in the trades and I work with them at every stage
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.340]   of their life.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:33.460]   Or it can be working with a certain type of product or situation.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:39.580]   I do estate planning for high net worth individuals or I do long retirement planning, things like
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.580]   that.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.860]   So you've got to find what type of niche.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:45.780]   But the future is in the niche, especially when it comes to marketing.
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:49.780]   Again, the biggest con of working with large companies, they don't allow you to establish
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.820]   your own separate branded presence.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:56.260]   More than anything else, that would be the reason why it would be very difficult for
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:00.020]   me, knowing what I now know, to go back into that structure.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:04.300]   I think that these companies are losing the game.
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:11.600]   Playing this game the old way of making phone calls is – hey, you can still reach people
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.820]   on the phone.
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:17.880]   But when you can take a phone call and you can buttress that with being a known specialist
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:28.460]   in an area, with the access of information, with good high value content, man, it's
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:32.580]   hard for me to think that I would ever lose my voice or surrender my voice.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.980]   It was hard for me to ever think I would ever surrender my platform again knowing what I
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:36.980]   now know.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:42.180]   Now, if I were brand new again, didn't have the opportunity, who knows?
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:45.980]   We're dealing in things that are in some ways unknowable.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:52.700]   But the platform is everything.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:56.180]   I always imagine being in a nice clean office, creating a plan for people's finances.
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.380]   It's a good imagination.
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:06.700]   But if you want to do that, you need to be a back office specialist, financial planner
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.420]   for an established advisory team.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:12.600]   Find a team that you can become a part of and you can become the technical specialist
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.900]   because that is not the business.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.060]   The business is very much go, go, go, go, go.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:19.060]   I mean you drive a lot.
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.300]   You go in to see people.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.580]   I made a couple of transitions.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:25.940]   I successfully transitioned most of my driving stuff to doing web conferencing.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:30.580]   If I were to do it today, I could today knowing what I now know, I could set up a completely
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:35.060]   independent virtual web only financial advisory practice.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:40.340]   That wasn't quite as easy in 2008 when I started as it is today.
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.340]   Is it as effective?
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.760]   No, it's a lot more work.
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.980]   But I could have done that.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.500]   So in the first few years, it is nothing like you're imagining.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.980]   On the back end, is it like that?
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.520]   Yeah, it really can be.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:55.880]   So by my fifth or sixth year, I got to the point where I spent at least four days a week
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.920]   in the office and I did very few driving appointments just because I hated it.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.920]   I didn't want to drive all over town and be treated like a traveling shoe salesman.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.320]   I wanted to just do it in the office.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:11.280]   I also found that because the technology got so much easier that it was much easier and
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.280]   better to do.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:16.240]   So it can become that way but it's not that way in the beginning.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.280]   Is it really difficult finding clients?
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.280]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.360]   It's very difficult finding clients.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.600]   It's the same in every business.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.080]   Finding customers and clients is the most challenging thing.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.080]   Is it doable?
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.200]   Yes, but it's certainly difficult.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.840]   Nobody has it easy.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.520]   But if you have a system that works, you have a prospecting system, you have a marketing
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:43.000]   system and you're diligent about it, it's doable.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.960]   It's not easy but it's doable and it can be very worth it.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.800]   Yes, there are hundreds of thousands of advisors but you know what?
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.320]   The majority of them are terrible.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:55.920]   So if you're a good advisor, then all you got to do is just not – don't suck.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:00.160]   Be effective and you'll find that people will be drawn to you.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:04.760]   That's where your time duration in the business makes all the difference in the world.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:10.520]   I've emphasized how difficult it is in the first place, in the first beginning years.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:16.480]   But on the back end, as you become established, it can be much, much easier.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:19.360]   Now to your final question, you say, "I was curious to know if the location where
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:24.160]   you practice as a financial advisor makes a big difference in the income or quality
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.400]   of life and if there is a big gap in income between places like West Palm Beach, Florida
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.360]   versus Dallas, Texas versus Northern Virginia near DC, etc.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:36.440]   Also is it easy to transition from one location to another one once you get started or is
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.960]   that a huge setback?"
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.600]   So the answer is yes, the income is going to change depending on how you do it and that's
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.680]   where the world we live in in 2016 is so special.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:51.320]   The most productive – I believe he still holds the record, but the most productive
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.760]   insurance salesman of all time is actually a New York life salesman called – name,
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.360]   name, name, Ben Feldman.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:06.640]   Ben Feldman was just an amazing guy who sold more life insurance than anybody else.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.220]   He sold more life insurance based on every metric at that time.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:15.740]   Now if memory is right, he lived in a little rural town in Ohio, in Ohio River Valley somewhere.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:16.740]   He wasn't in a big city.
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.580]   He wasn't in a big metropolis.
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:22.980]   So you can work effectively in just about any location.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:27.420]   Now is there going to be an easier time in some locations versus others?
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.020]   Yes, of course.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:34.220]   So the bigger – and your style of practice is going to vary.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:42.500]   If you live in Miami, Florida or Washington, D.C. or New York City, you could build a practice
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:49.820]   focusing on very high dollar cases and do relatively few of them.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:54.580]   If you live in a rural town, you can do very, very well but you're probably going to have
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:58.300]   lots and lots of little cases, lots and lots of little clients.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:03.860]   When I was in the business, there was always – we would have every year a couple of conventions
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.500]   and at those conventions, they would give out sales awards.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.220]   We had a regional one and a national one.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:13.860]   When I go to the national one, I would always be blown away by the reps up in Minnesota.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:20.860]   There were these reps up in Minnesota and they would do hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:25.700]   of cases and they did so well financially.
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:30.060]   But they were all much smaller average case size than the rep in Miami.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.940]   So that's where you would measure production.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:35.300]   So here specifically, I'm referring to insurance production.
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:39.780]   You'd measure your insurance production based upon the average – the total volume
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:41.100]   of premium.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:45.020]   Total volume of premium is what drives your upfront commissions.
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:48.500]   So you can do a million dollars of premium on one life or you can do a million dollars
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.820]   of premium on 100 lives or a million dollars of premium on 1,000 lives.
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:56.020]   Lives means the number of policies, so 1,000 individual policies.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:01.740]   But there's a very big difference of your average case size depending on whether you're
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.140]   working in a little town in Minnesota versus Miami.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:09.860]   So you can build a practice in any place and especially now with being able to work with
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:12.780]   people in other countries – excuse me, other states.
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:19.100]   I worked hard to become somewhat proficient on the phone and with video presentations.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.900]   You can establish yourself – and there are many practice models to do this.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.060]   You can establish yourself as a national expert.
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:28.820]   I was licensed in at least a dozen or two states.
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:33.080]   Or you just apply for them as you get clients and cases in those states.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.460]   So you can build an effective practice with video conferencing in a way that in the past
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.940]   was much more challenging.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.060]   I've done it just on the phone too, phone and just FedEx everything.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:46.500]   That's much cheaper to FedEx everything than to drive around your own city all the
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.980]   time and show up for appointments that are canceled.
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:50.700]   That was the thing I looked at as efficiency.
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.260]   If I work on the phone, if someone cancels me, I'm right in my office.
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:54.420]   I can get right on to the next thing.
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:58.380]   I don't have to spend 30 minutes driving out there and 30 minutes driving back to get
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.540]   stood up.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:05.020]   So you can build it in any place but your practice is going to look different.
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:12.060]   If I were working in central Florida, I would be looking for the big farmers, the big money.
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.780]   I'd be working to work with them.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:18.380]   But I'd also be effectively working with many more people of smaller cases.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:23.420]   And that's the cool thing about financial planning, especially if you can sell insurance.
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:28.900]   You can work profitably with people who are not multimillionaires.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:33.540]   So it all depends on what kind of practice structure that you want to work with.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:37.380]   If you have insurance to sell, you don't have to pull the Merrill Lynch, we only work
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.800]   with people who have $450,000 of assets.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.020]   You can work with young families.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.560]   You can work with people and you can do it very profitably.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.340]   But it all depends on the product mix that you have to sell.
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:53.420]   So location matters but you build a practice for the location that you want to live in.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:13:00.260]   And so what I would choose is in setting things up, I would choose where do I want to live.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:01.980]   Do I want to live in a ski town in Colorado?
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:03.660]   Do I want to live in Dallas, Texas?
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:06.260]   Do I want to live in Washington, D.C.?
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:11.020]   Because your money in rural Kentucky will go farther than your money will in Washington,
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:12.020]   D.C.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.380]   Your lifestyle will be very different.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:18.060]   So you can choose the lifestyle that you want to live and then you can build a practice
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.380]   in that area.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:26.580]   There are – I think Edward Jones built their business based upon being able to work in
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:27.580]   little towns, right?
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:31.220]   Are they the firm that would send the people out knocking on the doors, "Hey, I'm opening
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.180]   up an Edward Jones office?"
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:35.580]   So you can adjust to the location.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.980]   Choose the location you want to live in first and then figure out what kind of practice
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.620]   model will make sense there.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.740]   Now can you move after the fact?
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.780]   Yes, you can.
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:44.780]   Is it easy?
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:45.780]   No.
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:46.780]   You're going to – is it getting easier?
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:47.780]   Yes.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.420]   You can do it as well with virtual meetings.
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:53.740]   You can move and you can maintain clients and a lot of advisors do this.
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:56.540]   Here in South Florida, there's lots of advisors that have an office up in the northeast and
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.540]   an office down here.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:02.540]   They try to do snowbirds and they fly one place, do a couple weeks of meetings and fly
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.540]   back and forth.
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.060]   There are lots of people who do that.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:06.060]   You can set it up.
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:11.500]   So I know that – I mean those are the ways that – that's the detail that I can share
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.900]   with you to try to help you make a decision.
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:16.700]   I know there's lots of information there, probably for some of you a dry show if you've
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.700]   made it to here.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.580]   But that's my best effort for you.
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:26.940]   That's the unfiltered discussion on what the business is actually like.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.380]   It is a tough business, Kay.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.820]   It's a tough business.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:32.700]   There's a reason why it's a lucrative business.
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:36.140]   It's a lucrative business because it's so difficult.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:39.020]   The insurance companies, if they wanted to – if they didn't – if it were easier
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:42.660]   to sell insurance or easier to place investments, they wouldn't have to pay as much commission.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.660]   You think they just want to send all the money out in commission?
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:45.660]   No.
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.780]   They want to pay it – they want to consent – pay it to get people to be worth – to
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:49.780]   do the work.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:51.260]   So it's a very difficult business.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.260]   You know what?
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:54.660]   I'm going to close – I'm going to kill the music for a second because I don't want
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:58.740]   to be brushed on this last thing here.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:04.360]   Every business has difficult things to it.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:05.860]   Every business has good.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.220]   Every business has bad.
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.860]   My business presently has a lot of good.
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:13.380]   But it's also got some things that I don't particularly love doing.
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:16.620]   No matter the business, it always comes with that.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:24.340]   So my encouragement to you is get very clear on the why and then from there, you can build
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.780]   all of the things down the road.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.580]   Every business has pluses and minuses.
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:31.580]   I hope this information – we'll just skip the music here.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:38.260]   I hope this information is useful for you and you can make an educated decision.
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:40.260]   So I wish you all the best.
