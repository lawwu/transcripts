[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840]   Alright, Samantha asks, How do I pick a college major if I shouldn't follow my passion slash
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.840]   interest?
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.660]   Well, so Samantha, this is where I can point again to my core idea videos, there is now
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.520]   a core idea video live on the YouTube page about my idea of not following your passion.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.820]   So the background for this discussion can be found on that video, everyone can go reference
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.040]   it to get the specific thoughts behind my ideas about passion and its role in career
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.040]   selection.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.400]   And the thing you will notice if you go back and rewatch that video is that passions slash
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.640]   interest is a problematic conjunction, they're not the same thing.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.280]   So you're the issue here is you're joining those two things together.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.520]   Passion is the idea that you are wired for a particular pursuit or direction.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.040]   And that if you align yourself with that pursuit, you will be happy and fulfilled.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.560]   And if you don't, you won't.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.840]   It is a very high bar, there's one true thing you're supposed to be doing, get it right
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.440]   or you're screwed.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.720]   Interest is here's something that seems interesting to me.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.440]   There can be many things that seem interesting to you.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.240]   And many things that don't.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.680]   I think interest is a perfectly fine criteria to help select, let's say a major, this major
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.240]   seems interesting to me.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.180]   I like the opportunities that would open up if I did it well, good, go for that.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.700]   And what if there's five majors that pass that criteria, then it doesn't really matter
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.480]   which one you choose.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.760]   Passion is not the same as interest.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.800]   Passion says there's one true thing if you get it wrong, you're screwed.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.620]   Interest is just a useful piece of information you can use in making a choice.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.080]   So what I'm trying to do here is lower the bar.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.320]   Lower the bar when it comes to selecting something like a major or selecting a career, lowering
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.120]   the bar from there's one right answer.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.960]   If you get it wrong, you're screwed.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.760]   Down to there's a lot of reasonable pursuits on which you can build a enjoyable academic
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.920]   career in which you can build an enjoyable professional career.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.160]   There's a lot of them.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.160]   So give it a little bit of thought.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.440]   But once you find something that's reasonable, go with it and don't overthink it.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.640]   I think the straw man that you're sitting up here, Samantha, is throwing the bar out
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.000]   and say, no, it doesn't matter what you do.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.640]   Just choose completely randomly.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.880]   Problem studies or computer science.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   I'll just throw a dart.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   Who cares?
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   And I think that's nonsense, right?
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.560]   Like we have inclinations, we have interest, we have skills we've already built out in
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.800]   one area versus another.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.920]   We like the lifestyles enabled by this path better than the lifestyles enabled by that
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.440]   path.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.080]   Use all that information to make a selection, but just don't overthink it and be happy with
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.880]   the fact there might be a bunch of different choices that all satisfy those criteria.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.000]   What really matters is what you do next.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.880]   What you do once you actually made that choice.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.280]   And the reason why this is important is that it was actually college majors was the original
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.400]   thing that got me interested in the topic of following your passion.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.440]   It was the original thing that set me down the path to writing my book, So Good They
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.920]   Can't Ignore You.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.120]   Because what I was seeing when I was a graduate student writing advice for students is I kept
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.400]   hearing the same story again and again.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.280]   Students at these elite schools like MIT would come time to choose their major and they'd
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.680]   been taught follow your passion.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.520]   So they believed there's one major I'm wired to do.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.080]   The chorus of angels will start singing if I choose that right major and if I get it
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.720]   wrong it's going to be bad.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.320]   And here's what would happen.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.120]   They would get to their junior year.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.620]   The courses would get harder.
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.940]   Why did the courses get harder?
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.080]   Because they're in their junior year.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.320]   This is where you have to take the upper level courses that depend on the intro courses as
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.860]   their prerequisites.
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.040]   Hard courses aren't super fun.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.360]   The problem sets are difficult.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   It's frustrating.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   You can't get things right.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   They're difficult.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.800]   You get worse grades on essays than you're used to.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.520]   That's part of how this works.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.520]   But because these students were taught you have a one true passion in the chorus of angels
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.360]   will sing if you find it, they would take this hardness, this sense of, oh, I don't
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.160]   love this every day as an indication that I must not have chosen the one true passion.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.600]   How could this possibly be my one true passion if it's frustrating me and I don't love it?
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.840]   And what they would do, they would switch their majors late in the game.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.000]   And it would be a problem because it's hard to start from scratch with a new major.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.360]   And it was this epidemic of late stage major shifting that actually first got me interested
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.320]   in these topics of passion culture.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   I thought this was crazy.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.640]   Like, what are you guys doing?
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.200]   You can't switch your major this late.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.800]   Like, you're going to have to spend an extra year.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   You're going to be scrambling.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   You're going to be miserable.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.000]   But they were so sure that passion was a thing and passion means you'll love it.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.680]   And they weren't loving it because, you know, the differential equations you're doing in
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.400]   your junior year, you're in your physics major are a pain.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.960]   And they would switch and it would really be bad for them.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   It would really be negative.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.640]   It would hurt their academic life.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.520]   It would make them miserable in their personal life.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.040]   And it didn't open up any new opportunities.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.640]   And so that's what actually got me into this topic in the first place.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.960]   So no, we're not wired to do one thing, but it doesn't mean we can do everything.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.620]   So use reasonable criteria to make a choice.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.160]   Have a reason why you choose something, but don't over sweat that reason.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.600]   And don't be worried if more than one thing satisfies it.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.040]   There's lots of paths to a passionate, interesting life.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.440]   You don't have to find the one true thing, but you do have to give it a little bit of
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.800]   thought.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.880]   [MUSIC]
