[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   If it takes 200 years to achieve artificial intelligence,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   and then finally there is a textbook that explains how it's done,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.800]   the hardest part of that textbook to write
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.600]   will be the part that explains why people didn't think of it 200 years ago.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.600]   Because we're really talking about how to make machines do
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.000]   things that are really on the surface of our minds.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.400]   It's just that our ability to observe our own mental processes
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.600]   is not very good and has not been very good.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.600]   When we look at Leibniz, he invented binary numbers,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.800]   but he didn't even invent propositional calculus
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.200]   that was invented by Boole 150 years later.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.600]   And then Boole didn't invent predicate calculus.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.200]   So what one sees is that each step in understanding of thought processes
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.800]   has taken time.
