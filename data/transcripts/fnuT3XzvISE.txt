[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.140]   Well, God is our refuge and our fortress.
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.500]   And in that great refuge Psalm of Psalm 91,
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.220]   we're given this glorious promise that he who dwells
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.020]   in the shelter of the Most High will abide
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.380]   in the shadow of the Almighty.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.580]   That's the first verse of Psalm 91.
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.140]   And such a high promise prompted APJ listener, Anna,
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.140]   to write in.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.620]   Anna lives in Atlanta, and she writes this,
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.860]   "Pastor John, hello and thank you
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.220]   "for your faithful labors.
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.520]   "My question comes from Psalm 91.1.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.900]   "What does it mean to dwell in the shelter
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.260]   "of the Most High and to abide
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.080]   "in the shadow of the Almighty?
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.220]   "Is there a New Testament equivalent to this
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.520]   "for believers in Christ?
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.740]   "And is the practice of daily scripture reading part of it?"
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.460]   Pastor John, what would you say to Anna?
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.340]   - Yes, there is a New Testament equivalent.
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.980]   And yes, scripture reading is certainly part
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.100]   of the way you keep dwelling in the shelter
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.380]   of the Most High.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.860]   But to get at the actual meaning,
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.900]   let's quote the Psalm, Psalm 91,
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.060]   and then look at an event from the life
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.540]   of a martyred missionary, Jim Elliot,
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.580]   whose biography is titled by his wife,
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.980]   "Shadow of the Almighty."
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.100]   The phrase comes from Psalm 91 that begins like this.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.140]   "He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.480]   "will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.480]   "I will say to the Lord, 'My refuge and my fortress,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.860]   "'my God, in whom I trust.'"
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.140]   And then it continues in verse seven
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.120]   with these amazing words.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.800]   "A thousand may fall at your side,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.940]   "10,000 at your right hand,
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.500]   "but it will not come near you."
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.900]   Meaning the arrow,
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.720]   killing all these others won't come near you.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.060]   "You will only look with your eyes
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.280]   "and see the recompense of the wicked
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.980]   "because you have made the Lord your dwelling place."
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.980]   So it sounds like to dwell in the shadow of the Almighty
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.380]   and in the shelter of the Most High means
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.980]   that if someone throws a spear at you,
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.420]   it will not hit you.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.420]   So was Elizabeth Elliot naive, unbiblical,
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.180]   when she titled her husband's biography,
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.560]   "Shadow of the Almighty,"
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.260]   even though he and four others were speared to death
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.260]   by the Warrani Indians in January 8, 1956 in Ecuador
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.060]   while they were trying to evangelize them?
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.340]   She's been asked that question.
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.460]   She's with the Lord now,
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.460]   but she was asked that question
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.700]   and I personally spoke to her many times.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.780]   Most people considered her confidence in God's sovereignty
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.760]   to be a little bit misplaced.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.900]   Here was her answer at the end of the book.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.900]   You can read it on the last pages of that biography.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.540]   Quote, "The world did not recognize the truth
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.860]   "of the second clause of Jim Elliot's credo.
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.940]   "He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.620]   "to gain what he cannot lose."
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.020]   Now, what did he mean by that?
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.800]   What did she mean when she quoted it?
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.460]   Well, they both meant this,
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.460]   that if God sees fit to let the arrow that flies by day
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.220]   or the spear of a Warrani Indian kill one of God's children,
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.740]   God has done it for the sake of gain.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.580]   He said to gain what he cannot lose.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.400]   God has done it for gain, not loss.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.380]   And I think she's right.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.980]   I think he was right.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.140]   That's a right interpretation of Psalm 91
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.540]   because, here's why I think that,
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.540]   Satan tried to use Psalm 91 in Matthew 4, 6
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.340]   to tempt Jesus to jump off the temple
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.780]   because Psalm 91 promises the angels are gonna catch you.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.700]   But Jesus won't use Psalm 91 that way.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.740]   Neither did Stephen when he was stoned to death.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.660]   Neither did James when he was beheaded.
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.420]   Neither did Paul when he was beaten repeatedly with rods.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.620]   Neither did Jesus as he bent down over the cross.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.060]   None of them understood Psalm 91
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.720]   to mean that God's children will never suffer
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.140]   at the hands of their enemies.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.100]   So, what does it mean?
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.540]   I mean, Satan was trying to get them to think it meant that.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.020]   What does it mean to abide in the shadow of the Almighty
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.560]   if you can be killed in the shadow of the Almighty?
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.740]   Well, let's go to the New Testament counterpart of this text.
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.720]   So she asked, is there a New Testament counterpart?
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.140]   There are several.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.980]   For example, Jude 1, 21 says,
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.540]   "Keep yourselves in the love of God."
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.500]   I think that is virtually the same
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.740]   as keep yourselves in the shadow of the Almighty.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.740]   Or Jesus says in John 15, 9, "Abide in my love,"
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.420]   which I think is the same as
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.860]   abide in the shelter of the Most High.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.440]   In other words, dwelling in the shadow of the Almighty
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.460]   and abiding in the shelter of the Most High
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.980]   mean trusting implicitly in the love of God,
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.460]   the power of God to give you everything you need
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.100]   to do His will and glorify His name,
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.920]   whether you live or die.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.460]   Or to say it another way,
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.140]   dwelling in the shadow of the Most High
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.900]   and keeping yourself in the love of God
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.980]   means trusting the love of God and the wisdom of God
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.860]   and the power of God to protect you
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.300]   from everything that could destroy you utterly.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.460]   Now, why do I say that?
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.420]   One of the clearest reasons for saying that
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.140]   is found in Romans 8, 32 to the end of the chapter,
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.900]   maybe the greatest paragraph in the Bible.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.380]   Paul argues that God's love for His elect,
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.920]   His adopted children,
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.060]   proven in the death of His son Jesus,
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.060]   Romans 8, 32, means that He will with absolute certainty,
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.540]   quote, graciously give us all things.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.220]   He who did not spare His own son,
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.020]   but gave Him up for us all,
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.020]   how will He not with Him graciously give us all things?
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.900]   Answer, He will.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.380]   But what does that mean, all things?
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.100]   And he goes on to explain,
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.020]   and he even uses the Psalms to explain it.
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.460]   He argues that if we are in the love of Christ,
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.380]   in the shadow of the Almighty,
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.940]   nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.220]   Then he throws out a few possibilities
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.220]   of what might separate us,
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.060]   and it shows he's really quite aware of Psalm 91.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.060]   He says, "Shall tribulation or distress or persecution
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.300]   "or famine or nakedness or danger or sword,"
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.940]   or he might've added, "or Wahrani, Indian spear."
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.220]   And then he quotes Psalm 44,
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.380]   as it is written, "For your sake," not sin's sake,
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.600]   "your sake, we are being killed all day long.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.580]   "We are counted as sheep to be slaughtered."
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.580]   So even the Psalms knew God's people die while doing good.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:57.100]   Then he shouts the answer, "No, in all these things,
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.540]   "we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us."
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.940]   That's Romans 8, 32 to 37.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.500]   So Paul is saying,
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.420]   Christians can keep themselves in the love of God
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.100]   and in the shadow of the Almighty
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.380]   and still be slaughtered like sheep,
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.100]   and yet be more than conquerors.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.780]   So if the arrow that flies by day
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.060]   goes straight into your chest
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.040]   and you drop dead in the cause of Christ,
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.580]   it does not defeat you.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.320]   You are more than a conqueror.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.500]   How more than a conqueror?
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.620]   Because the very arrow that seemed to get the victory
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.700]   becomes your servant
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.640]   and accomplishes God's sovereign purpose in the world
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.220]   and God's saving purpose for your life,
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.700]   His everlasting presence.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.220]   Here's how the book of Revelation says it.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.620]   "And they conquered Satan by the blood of the Lamb
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.460]   "and by the word of their testimony,
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.780]   "for they loved not their lives even unto death.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.780]   "So they die in persecution, but they conquer Satan."
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.020]   How?
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.200]   This is the answer to Anna's question.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.400]   How do you dwell in the shelter of the Most High?
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.200]   They trusted implicitly in the blood of the Lamb,
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.960]   that it had absolutely secured for them
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.680]   their future happiness forever.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.140]   And they opened their mouth and gave testimony
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.640]   and the fear of death did not stop them.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.280]   And in that moment,
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.260]   they were safe in the shadow of the Almighty
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:42.140]   and they conquered the devil and they entered paradise.
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.480]   I think that's the kind of triumphant safety
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.380]   that God is calling us to in Psalm 91.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.900]   - Glorious, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.440]   And thank you for the question, Anna.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.100]   If you have a question like Anna did, you can ask it
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.660]   or you can search our growing archive
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.940]   or you can subscribe to the podcast,
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.940]   all@desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.900]   Well, next time we have a really, really hard question.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.700]   It's from a dad whose 14-year-old daughter is struggling
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.940]   after studying the book of Job for the first time.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.780]   She has heard all of her life that God is loving and just
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.980]   and she cannot understand why God would allow Job
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.000]   and his children, wife, and servants
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.440]   to suffer so much devastation.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.760]   And all for what purpose?
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.120]   Merely to prove to Satan
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.200]   that Job's reverence for God was unshakable.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.540]   So what more can be said about Job?
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.840]   Don't miss this episode.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.680]   It's up next time.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.500]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.600]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
