And you don't have to wait until you have a million dollars in the bank, you just need to figure out how to solve that 75 dollar per day nut. Now let me give you an additional example. Let's say that you were renting in the circumstances that I discussed and you had no money, no assets, but you were just looking to live a different lifestyle.

[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   You own something and you have a little different lifestyle. I don't think it would be a crazy decision to make. I personally would do it on the cheap and I would use the money I had because if you do that, it all of a sudden changes everything because now your daily costs can plummet and you don't have to stay in RV parks. You don't have to stay $30 a night. There are some people that never pay for a place to park their RV. You have to invest in infrastructure. You'd invest in your own power systems, your own waste disposal systems, etc. And you can do the same thing on a house. You substitute a monthly payment for infrastructure.

[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:06.740]   and you can do this in other ways as well. One of the interesting stories I heard a number of years ago, I read a profile of a very wealthy man. I forget how he made his wealth, but he was extremely wealthy, but he also had a bent towards non-consumption or towards a form of minimalism. In short, he had seen how the ownership of many items didn't become a blessing. It became more of a waste.

He only stayed in luxury hotels and he just substituted living the luxury hotel lifestyle for owning houses and apartments and things like that all around the world. Well, if you actually run the math on that, it can be a pretty powerful proposition. Staying in hotels full-time
