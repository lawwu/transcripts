[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.240]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.840]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.720]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.600]   My name is Joshua and I am your host.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.120]   I am your fellow journeyman, fellow voyager down this path towards financial freedom.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.960]   And I want to share with you some things that I have found useful in my own quest for financial
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.960]   freedom.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.320]   Specifically today, I want to talk to you about the number.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.560]   But I want to talk to you about the number in a way different than usually this subject
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.280]   is addressed.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.440]   Most commonly when people think about the number, they think in terms of how many millions
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.040]   of dollars do I need in order to be financially independent.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.880]   There's a place for that.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.240]   But the trouble is we have a hard time conceptualizing millions of dollars.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.640]   Very few of us have ever seen a million dollars.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.280]   We very rarely held a million dollars in our hands.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:44.640]   Very rarely do we have the ability to grasp what the time and the effort were that were
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.880]   needed in order to accumulate a million dollars.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.280]   And so most commonly this millions of dollars number floats into your brain, usually at
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.360]   the input of some financial advisor or some financial writer, and then it floats right
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.440]   out again because it is a number that's hard to grasp.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.200]   Well, I'm a simple man and I like to keep things in a way that I can grasp.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.800]   So here's something that I have done over the years.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.760]   I've taken my numbers and I've translated them from millions of dollars into the smallest
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.640]   unit that I can conceive of, the smallest practical unit.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.240]   For me, that most useful number has been daily expense.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.560]   Certainly there's a place for monthly expense and annual expense, and I use those all the
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.920]   time when I do financial planning.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.080]   But a daily number is really interesting because it comes and goes every day.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.920]   Number of years ago in my own quest towards financial freedom, I sat down with a spreadsheet
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.240]   and I took all of my expenses and I consistently built a column in my spreadsheet that would
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.120]   translate those expenses into a daily number so I could look at them and analyze them.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.960]   Let me give you a simple example.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   How much does it cost you to house yourself and your family on a daily basis right now?
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.440]   Pause for a moment and think about how much it costs to house you and your family on a
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.920]   daily basis.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.280]   Let me give you an example.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.120]   Let's assume that your rent payment is $1,800 a month.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.680]   That would be, that's about the median rent where I live.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.240]   Your area may be higher or lower, but let's just use $1,800 a month.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.720]   I like to divide by 30, so take $1,800 and divide by 30 and you come up with a number
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.960]   of $60 per day.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.680]   So it costs you for your rent payment $60 per day.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.960]   Now of course you have other utilities that are associated with your housing expenses.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.640]   Perhaps you have an electrical bill.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.040]   Perhaps that bill is $150 per month.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.660]   Well if that's $150 per month, then your electrical bill is $5 per day.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.180]   Perhaps you have a water bill that's also $150 per month.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.440]   Well if so, then you're paying $5 per day for your water bill.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.520]   Perhaps you have a utility, a cable bill, an internet bill, and perhaps that bill also,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.080]   everything combined is $100 per month.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.900]   Well now you know that your daily cost is $3.50 per day.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.320]   You can do this with any other numbers that you have.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.200]   For example, if your lawn service is $100 per month, well now you know it's a little
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.160]   under $3.50 per day, and you go down your numbers.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.720]   But let's just stick with those four simple numbers that I've chosen.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.040]   In fact, I'm going to round up.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.640]   I'm going to say that your TV and your internet comes out to be $150 per month, so that's
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.440]   an even $5 per day.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.800]   After all, audio math is generally better when we do $5 numbers instead of $3.33.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.640]   If you add that up, your rental cost per day is $60 per day, your electric cost is $5 per
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.280]   day, your water cost is $5 per day, and your TV and internet is $5 per day.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.960]   Totals $75 per day.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.920]   $75 per day is what it costs you to live there.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.560]   Now there are a number of ways that you can take this number and you can expand on it.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.040]   So you could look at your income and you could say, "How many hours of work does it take
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.520]   me to earn $75 after taxes?"
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.000]   That's a useful thing to know.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.600]   But you can also take this and look at it and say, "Well, how could I replace that $75
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.520]   per day?"
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.000]   As an entrepreneur, I've often found it easier to think of ways to make $75 per day than
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:58.440]   to save the large number that I would need in order to pay for the $75 per day from investments.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.120]   That number would be about just under $700,000.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.080]   I think this also shows my own personal bias towards entrepreneurship as a path towards
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   freedom.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.240]   Not that entrepreneurship is easy, but most experienced entrepreneurs would say that it's
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.740]   easier to figure out a way to earn $75 a day from a reasonable, pleasing business that
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.120]   adds value to your neighbors than it is to work and save just under $700,000 to provide
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.320]   for that with investments.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.280]   But here's what I want to home in on.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.460]   If you think about the number in terms of $75 per day, let's assume that you can square
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.460]   away the income.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:46.160]   How could you arrange your lifestyle to get the most value from that $75 per day?
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.480]   What could you do?
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.880]   This was a calculation I did a number of years ago when I first thought of taking an RV trip.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.280]   I announced on the show a number of months ago that my family and I are going to be heading
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.160]   off on an extended tour of the United States.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.960]   We were delayed a few months beyond when I intended to leave, which is why I've been
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.920]   quiet about it on the show, but we are leaving here in June.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.400]   In very short order, most of our house is empty, most of our stuff is gone, we're storing
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.580]   most of our things on Craigslist.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.340]   And so in very short order, my family and I will be on the road and I'll be speaking
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.440]   to you from the road.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.640]   And I'll share with you a little bit more about that journey along the way.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.120]   I'm not going to turn Radical Personal Finance into the RVing the United States podcast,
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.520]   but I will try to share with you some of the experiences to tell you what I thought before
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.680]   the trip and what I've learned from the trip.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.040]   But the financial feasibility of this lifestyle is really compelling if you stop and think
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.080]   about it on a per day cost.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.560]   Here's the major problem with going on vacation.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:57.320]   All of the costs of vacation are added to your normal monthly budget.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.880]   So most people have a housing budget of $75 per day, their rent, the utilities, etc.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.160]   And if they go on vacation, that $75 per day doesn't disappear.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:15.400]   It stays the same, except it gets all of those vacation expenses added to it.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.160]   So now we add hotel expenses, say $150 a night.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.520]   You add eating out expenses, say $75 per day.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.880]   You add entertainment expenses, other various expenses, and all of a sudden you're at $250,
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.860]   $300 per day.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.960]   Which is where the average family then says, "Well, I can afford a 10-day vacation at $300
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.620]   per day, and that's a total of $3,000.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.640]   There goes my vacation budget."
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.840]   But if you just simply swap one set of $75 per day expenses for a different set of $75
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:52.120]   per day expenses, all of a sudden now you can live a different lifestyle and experience
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.120]   financial freedom.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.560]   And you don't have to wait until you have millions of dollars in the bank.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.240]   You just need to figure out how to solve that $75 per day nut.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.360]   Now let me give you an additional example.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.720]   Let's say that you were renting in the circumstances that I discussed, and you had no money, no
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.620]   assets, but you were just looking to live a different lifestyle on a $75 per day budget.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.560]   How could you do it?
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.780]   Well, you could approach it with the RV lifestyle.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.440]   This is of course what many retirees do.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.560]   There are many people living on Social Security as their only income source, living in RVs.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.440]   And many people who dream of retirement talk about traveling.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.120]   It's a major dream for most people.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.640]   Whether it is for you, doesn't matter.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.100]   You insert your own dream.
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.980]   But at least understand how it can be done.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.160]   The average cost to stay in something like a national park comes out to about $30 a night
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.360]   if you stay in a national park or state park campground.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.400]   Sometimes you can find them for 20, sometimes you can find them for more, but about 30 bucks
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   a night.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.720]   If you stay in private RV parks, it becomes a little bit more.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:10:02.240]   What you get for that fee, that $30 per night, is a place to park your rig, an electrical
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.160]   hookup, a water hookup, and a sewer hookup.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.520]   So you could look at your at-home electric bill of $5 per day, and you could look at
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.520]   your home water bill of $5 per day, and you could look at your home TV and internet bill
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.360]   at $5 per day, although the internet in most RV parks is pretty bad.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.320]   And you could say, "Okay, well, there's $15 per day to stay at home.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.780]   That's half of my $30 per night cost to stay in a national park.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.560]   What about the other half?"
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.080]   What's a place to park your rig so you need something to sleep in?
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.800]   Let's assume for a moment that you were just going to stay in parks, and you just needed
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.240]   something to sleep in.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.520]   So you went and you spent $30,000 on an RV, and because you didn't have any money, didn't
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.760]   have any assets, you borrowed the full $30,000, and you have a monthly payment now of $350
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.760]   per month.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:58.840]   Well, $350 per month divided by 30 comes out to a little under $12 per day.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.640]   Maybe you need something to tow that with.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.240]   You bought a trailer for $30,000, and you need something to tow that with, and so you
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.600]   buy another tow vehicle, and it comes out to $12 per day.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.540]   Well, now look what you've done for yourself.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:20.080]   You have $24 per day of vehicle payments, and you have about $30 to $40 per day of RV
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:28.120]   park payments, and now you're right at about that $65 per day, $55 to $65 per day number
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.400]   for RVing.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.280]   Very similar numbers to staying at home, but by looking at it under daily cost, you're
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:47.600]   substituting your own personal expenses and just simply changing the nature of them.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.680]   Now I'm not advocating that you do this plan.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.360]   I recommend that you don't borrow money for a trailer or a vehicle, but you got to say
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.120]   at least it's probably better than what most people do.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.560]   After all, if you're paying rent, it's a complete cost.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:07.360]   If you're making payments on an RV or a boat or some other form of living accommodation,
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.840]   at least possibly you own something and you have a little different lifestyle.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.680]   I don't think it would be a crazy decision to make.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.640]   I personally would do it on the cheap, and I would use the money I had because if you
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.200]   do that, it all of a sudden changes everything because now your daily costs can plummet,
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.560]   and you don't have to stay in RV parks.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.040]   You don't have to stay $30 a night.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.440]   There's some people that never pay for a place to park their RV.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.760]   You have to invest in infrastructure.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.360]   You'd invest in your own power systems, your own waste disposal systems, et cetera, and
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.400]   you can do the same thing on a house.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.600]   You substitute a monthly payment for infrastructure equipment that handles that need.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.440]   But calculate your dollar per day cost.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.840]   Now you can do this in other ways as well.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.560]   One of the interesting stories I heard a number of years ago, I read a profile of a very wealthy
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.560]   man.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.080]   I forget how he made his wealth, but he was extremely wealthy, but he also had a bent
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.080]   towards non-consumption or towards a form of minimalism.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.440]   In short, he had seen how the ownership of many items didn't become a blessing.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.920]   It became more of a weight.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:16.360]   And so this mega wealthy man lived full time in luxury hotels.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.660]   That was the decision that he made.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:25.880]   He only stayed in luxury hotels and he just substituted living the luxury hostel lifestyle
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.920]   for owning houses and apartments and things like that all around the world.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.100]   Well, if you actually run the math on that, it can be a pretty powerful proposition.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:43.700]   Staying in hotels full time, even at retail rates in luxury hotels.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.600]   Let's say you're spending, I don't know what luxury hotels cost in your neck of the woods.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.200]   Of course, they could be thousands, but let's say you're spending $300, $350 a night.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.080]   Multiply that on a monthly basis, that's only, that's $10,500 a month.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.520]   Certainly that's a luxury lifestyle, but that luxury hotel cost includes your place to stay,
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.680]   your bed to sleep in, your maid to clean things up, your groundskeepers to keep the place
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.240]   looking beautiful, your electricity costs, your water costs, your internet costs, et
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240]   cetera.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   It's all in.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.360]   You're just substituting one set of daily expenses for another set of daily expenses.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.120]   Isn't this useful to you?
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.860]   So here's my charge to you.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.500]   Take this idea and sit down with your own monthly budget.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.800]   Work out what your dollar per day cost is.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:36.720]   And then ask yourself, am I happy with how I'm spending this?
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.480]   Don't worry about the millions of dollars that you need.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.260]   Just look at the daily costs that you need.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.840]   You can solve millions of dollars later.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.760]   But today, just work on the daily costs.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.840]   What could you do to provide for yourself an income so that you can live on the per
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.400]   day structure that you find most helpful?
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.420]   Sit down and figure out what those numbers are because all of a sudden, the payments
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:07.840]   that seem so small on a monthly basis, when you put them on a daily basis, all of a sudden
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.200]   I have found that those payments are much more significant.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.640]   Many people will spend without thinking much about it $100 a month on something like a
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   phone.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.160]   Well, that would be a normal expense for many people.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:27.880]   But I don't know about you, but I always think twice about handing over a $5 bill.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.200]   It's not that I can't hand over a $5 bill, but if I were handing over a $5 bill every
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.560]   day, 5 times 30 would come out to be 150, so just using round numbers again.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.360]   If I were handing over a $5 bill every day, all of a sudden I would pay attention.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.640]   But I'm less inclined to pay attention to that monthly number.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.440]   Sit down, look at your budget, convert your numbers into daily expenses, and analyze that
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:59.000]   data and see if you are happy with how you're spending it.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Thank you for listening.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.220]   You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.040]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.760]   and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.160]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.160]   1.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.440]   If there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take action
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.920]   on it.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.340]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.680]   to a life change.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.660]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.360]   So take action.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.680]   2.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.120]   Take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody that
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.560]   you care about.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:51.740]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.200]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:00.040]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:06.880]   others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.120]   3.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.160]   If there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining financial
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.880]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
