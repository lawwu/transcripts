[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.600]   Thank you, Alan.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.480]   Now the moment you've all been waiting for.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.840]   It's my last introduction today.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.960]   Mike Piper's the secretary of the Vogel Center.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.080]   He is a licensed accountant in Colorado.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.960]   He's not licensed to do anything in Chicago,
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.720]   so no asking personal questions to him afterward.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.240]   He is the creator of an extremely successful investing
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.480]   blog, and that was actually the inspiration.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.360]   One of the inspirations for my blog.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.680]   He's been doing that for a long time,
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.760]   decade and a half or more.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.880]   He is also the creator of the best social security
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.200]   tool on the web.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.080]   He's the author of-- did I get this right?
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.720]   Is it 11 financial books?
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.720]   He doesn't know even.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.920]   That's how many he's lost track.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.000]   He's a top-rated speaker at conferences,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.920]   been the top-rated speaker at my conference before.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.720]   And he has over 4,000 posts on the Vogelheads forum.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.680]   And the truth is, despite being the smartest person
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.240]   on the stage today, he's also the most humble person.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.000]   So Mike Piper, come on up.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.800]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.640]   If I start wandering, because that's my natural inclination,
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.060]   please, somebody in the front row,
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.000]   just tell me to come back to the mic, please.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.320]   So today, I get to talk to you about minimizing taxes.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.520]   And there are a ton of things you can do
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880]   to try to minimize your taxes, of course.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.720]   But since we have limited time, we're
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.260]   going to talk about the two most important things you can do
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.920]   when investing related.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.480]   And those are to max out your retirement accounts,
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.100]   if you have enough cash flow to do that every year.
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.720]   And when you're investing in taxable accounts,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.600]   so when you're investing outside of a retirement account,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.720]   make sure to use tax-efficient mutual funds.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.720]   So starting with the first one, the idea
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.340]   here is basically, every year, make the maximum contribution
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.360]   to a Roth IRA if your income is such
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.700]   that you are allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.280]   If your income is too high, then look into the backdoor method
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.560]   for making Roth IRA contributions.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.520]   And if your employer offers a 401(k), 403(b), et cetera,
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.860]   to generally make the maximum contribution to that plan
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.000]   as well, if you have enough cash flow to do that.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.160]   Now, why is this a good idea?
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.320]   Why did this make it onto the list of Boglehead's Principles?
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.120]   It's because taxable accounts, so things
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.960]   that aren't retirement accounts, they
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.060]   incur tax drag every year, meaning
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.640]   that you have to pay tax on the interest that you earn,
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.520]   you have to pay tax on the dividends that you earn,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.480]   and you have to pay tax when you sell something
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.400]   that's a taxable gain.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.160]   So the net result is that taxable accounts,
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.720]   they have a lower rate of return.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.200]   They compound more slowly than retirement accounts.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.400]   And as we know from talking about mutual fund expense
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.960]   ratios, even a small difference in the annual rate of return
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.080]   makes a huge difference in the ending value
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   when you compound that return over many, many years.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.980]   So the idea here, you just max out retirement accounts
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.640]   because they don't have tax drag.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.200]   They grow more quickly because you
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.000]   get to actually receive the full rate of return
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.120]   every year that your investments are providing.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.160]   And a question that often comes up
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.740]   is, what about people who are planning
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.240]   to retire before 59 and 1/2?
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.400]   If you're planning on retiring before 59 and 1/2,
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.160]   people often ask, should I still be contributing
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.320]   to my retirement accounts?
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.780]   Because there's that rule where you
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.880]   might have to pay a 10% penalty if you take money out early.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.040]   And the answer overwhelmingly, in almost every case
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.520]   that I've looked at, is yes, it still
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.680]   makes sense to max out those accounts.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.760]   And there's two reasons.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.280]   Reason number one is that if you're
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.680]   planning on retiring early, you have to save a lot of money
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.480]   every year.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.240]   If you're planning on retiring at, let's say, age 50,
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.640]   well, the earlier you retire, the longer your retirement
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.360]   is going to be, obviously.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.140]   And so that means you need to accumulate a larger sum.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.000]   And the earlier you retire, the fewer the number of years
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.440]   that you have to accumulate that sum.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.680]   So really, the only way to do it is
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.120]   by saving a whole lot every year.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.360]   And in most cases, it actually means
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.280]   saving more than the contribution limits.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.600]   So you're saving enough to max out a Roth IRA,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.000]   max out your 401(k), and then still invest more
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.580]   in a taxable account.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.540]   So you're maxing out those retirement accounts
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.480]   and still accumulating some money in a taxable account
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.640]   that you'll have access to before age 59 and 1/2
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.060]   without having to jump through any hoops.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.560]   And the second reason that it still
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.760]   makes sense to max out retirement accounts
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.160]   is that money in retirement accounts
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160]   isn't as inaccessible as people often think
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.760]   that it is before 59 and 1/2.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.880]   Because number one, with Roth IRAs,
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.800]   any money that you put right into the account,
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.000]   any contributions that you make to the account,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.560]   you can take that money back out, tax-free and penalty-free
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.640]   at any time.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.320]   Somebody who's 24 could contribute to a Roth IRA,
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.060]   three months later need the money, they can take it out.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.800]   No tax, no penalty.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.000]   Similarly, with a Roth 401(k),
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.760]   after you separate from service,
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.800]   so after you leave that employer,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.760]   you can roll that money into a Roth IRA,
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.160]   and then anything that you had contributed
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.920]   to the Roth 401(k) now basically counts
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.440]   as a Roth IRA contribution.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.080]   So you're allowed to take it back out,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.040]   tax-free and penalty-free,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.040]   even if you're younger than 59 and 1/2.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.320]   Then we have the age 55 rule.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.680]   The way this works is if you leave an employer
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.720]   in a year in which you turn 55 or older,
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.480]   then from that point forward,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.040]   you can take money out of the 401(k) or 403(b)
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.200]   with that employer without having to pay the 10% penalty.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.480]   So basically, instead of 59 and 1/2,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.000]   now it's age 55, so you can access the money penalty-free
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.560]   a little bit sooner.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.680]   And then we also have the series
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.440]   of substantially equal periodic payments rule,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.280]   which is a mouthful,
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.960]   so people often just call it the 72(t) rule,
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.520]   because that's the part of our tax code that it comes from.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.320]   And the way that rule works is it basically says
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.160]   that if you take money out of a retirement account,
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.520]   and it's a certain percentage
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.280]   that's based on your life expectancy,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.920]   and you keep taking these distributions
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.680]   for a certain length of time,
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.600]   then they won't be subject to the 10% tax,
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.640]   even though you're younger than 59 and 1/2.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.200]   And there's some complicated rules that go along with that,
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   so if you're considering using that,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.160]   make sure to do your research
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.240]   or work with a tax professional.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.560]   But the point is it's another way
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.440]   that you can access this money before 59 and 1/2
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.160]   without paying a 10% penalty
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.760]   and without needing something bad to happen to you.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.480]   You don't have to become disabled.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.160]   So thing number one that you can do to minimize your taxes
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   is to max out those retirement accounts.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.080]   And the second thing you can do
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.400]   is when you're investing in taxable accounts,
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.760]   make sure to use tax-efficient mutual funds.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.720]   The idea here is after you have decided
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.040]   your asset allocation,
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.760]   so you've decided, for instance,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.120]   you want this much in US stocks
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.600]   and this much in international stocks
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.000]   and this much in bonds,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.600]   then take some time to think about what should go where,
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.520]   which funds should go in which accounts.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.200]   And we call that asset location
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.240]   as opposed to asset allocation.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.120]   And the idea, very briefly,
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.600]   is just to make sure to use tax-efficient funds
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.480]   in taxable accounts.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.600]   And there's a number of things that you can look for
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.920]   that would make a mutual fund tax-efficient.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.000]   Number one is you can look for low portfolio turnover.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.200]   Portfolio turnover is exactly what it sounds like.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.040]   It's just turnover within the mutual fund's portfolio.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.200]   So when the mutual fund buys and sells stuff,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.840]   that's portfolio turnover.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.480]   And the reason that's relevant from a tax point of view
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.800]   is that if you own shares of a mutual fund
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.560]   in a taxable brokerage account
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.640]   and the mutual fund sells something from the portfolio
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.440]   and it sells it for a gain,
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.000]   you have to pay tax on your share of that gain.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.800]   So even though you didn't sell anything,
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.280]   you're still paying a capital gains tax.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.000]   So it's the turnover,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.080]   it's creating what we call capital gain distributions
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.480]   that you have to pay tax on.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.080]   And the higher the rate of turnover,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.480]   the more capital gains distributions
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.640]   you're going to have to pay tax on.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.680]   And a higher rate of turnover also generally means
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.560]   that it's more likely that the capital gains
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.040]   will be short-term capital gains
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.760]   because the fund held whatever it is that it sold.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.160]   It held it for one year or less,
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.400]   which means it's a short-term gain,
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.880]   which has a higher tax rate.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.480]   So high turnover creates high tax costs.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.840]   So examples here, something that's very tax-efficient
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   is a total stock market index fund,
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.800]   because that's a strategy where the whole idea
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.000]   is just buy everything and hold it,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.240]   so it doesn't take hardly any selling at all.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.360]   So there's very little turnover
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.280]   and that makes it tax-efficient.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.480]   And at the tax inefficient end of the spectrum,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.240]   we have actively managed funds
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.400]   with really high rates of turnover.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.720]   It's going to create a lot of capital gains
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.840]   that you have to pay tax on.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.680]   Now, when we move to the bond side of the portfolio,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.480]   the general rule is that safer bonds
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.680]   have lower yields, which means there's less tax.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.200]   That makes them more tax-efficient.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.480]   And that's just multiplication, right?
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.680]   The less income something pays,
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.320]   the less tax you have to pay.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.960]   So safer bonds, lower yield, more tax-efficient.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.880]   And so when we talk about duration,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.800]   shorter-term bonds are generally more tax-efficient
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.680]   than longer-term bonds because they pay a,
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.840]   shorter-term bonds being safer,
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.000]   pay a lower rate of interest.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.720]   So that generally makes them more tax-efficient.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.480]   And when we talk about credit quality,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.360]   bonds with better credit ratings pay lower yields,
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.280]   and that makes them more tax-efficient as well.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.240]   So junk bonds, high-yield bonds,
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.200]   they're tax inefficient because they pay a lot of income
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.320]   and it's fully taxable as ordinary income.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.000]   And on the tax-efficient end of the spectrum
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.480]   with regard to bonds, we've got treasury bonds,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.920]   which are particularly tax-efficient
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.160]   because their high credit rating
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.720]   means they have relatively low yields, so low tax cost.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.880]   And the other thing that's applicable with treasury bonds
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.160]   is that they're exempt from state income tax.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.800]   And so if you live in a state with an income tax
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.720]   or especially one with a high tax rate,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.960]   that makes treasury bonds even more tax-efficient.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.520]   And then lastly, we have muni bonds,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.680]   which are bonds issued by state
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.160]   and local government entities,
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.080]   and they are completely exempt from federal income tax.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.920]   And in many cases,
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.680]   they're exempt from state income tax as well
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.920]   if you buy muni bonds from within your own state.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.680]   That's why you see state-specific tax-exempt bond funds.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.520]   That's the idea.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.360]   You buy bonds that are then gonna be exempt
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.440]   from state and federal income tax.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.360]   Now, when we're choosing between owning stocks or bonds
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.560]   in a taxable brokerage account,
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.120]   we have to figure out which one's more tax-efficient.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.200]   One relevant point is that qualified dividends
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.200]   and long-term capital gains are taxed at lower tax rates
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.920]   than ordinary bond interest income.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.360]   So that's a point in favor of stocks
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.600]   being more tax-efficient.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.800]   But we also have to think about how much income
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.680]   something pays in the first place, right?
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.640]   Because even if you have to pay a high tax rate,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.320]   if there's very little income,
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.280]   there's not gonna be much tax.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.280]   So the lower that interest rates are
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.160]   relative to, sorry, relative to bond yields,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.480]   the more tax-efficient bonds become relative to stocks.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.480]   So it's something that shifts over time.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.040]   So just to summarize,
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.800]   on the tax-efficient end of the spectrum,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.160]   we have things like total stock market index funds.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.000]   They're tax-efficient
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.960]   because they have very little turnover.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.280]   Treasury bonds are tax-efficient
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.440]   because their high credit rating
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.240]   means that they have relatively lower yields,
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.720]   which means less taxes,
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.280]   and they're exempt from state income tax.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.240]   Muni bonds are exempt from federal income tax,
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.600]   and in some case, state income tax
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.960]   if you buy ones from within your own state.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.880]   And shorter-term bonds are more tax-efficient
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.720]   than longer-term bonds because they're safer
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.840]   and therefore usually have a lower yield.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.760]   And then on the tax-inefficient end,
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.200]   we've got actively managed stock funds.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.560]   That high rate of turnover
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.160]   means more capital gains distributions
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.400]   that you have to pay tax on.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.120]   High-yield bonds are extremely tax-inefficient.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   They pay a high level of income,
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.800]   and that income is fully taxable
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.200]   at ordinary income tax rates.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.400]   So high-yield bonds, junk bonds,
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.640]   they are tax-inefficient.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.160]   And lastly, we have all-in-one funds.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.360]   That's things like target date funds
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.840]   and life strategy funds.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.440]   And we haven't talked about that yet
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.520]   because that's actually our next topic.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.600]   So the two most important things you can do
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   to minimize taxes when it comes to investing
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.280]   are simply max out your retirement accounts
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.680]   if you have enough cash flow to do that every year.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.040]   And when you're investing in a taxable account,
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.280]   make sure to use tax-efficient mutual funds.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:20.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
