[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   to me there's nothing more helpful or more important in
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.280]   interpreting scripture than checking those cross references
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.320]   and sometimes you'll find a trail of cross references, you
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.280]   go to the parallel verse and it has its own cross references
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.800]   that you can trace and it's a good way to do frankly topical
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.320]   studies.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.580]   If you wanted to do a study say for example on repentance start
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.320]   with a verse that talks about it and follow the cross references
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.040]   through and you'll see you know a number of things that
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.120]   scripture says and what the Bible says sometimes say in the
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.600]   book of Acts might help you better understand something that
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.440]   you find in one of the epistles.
