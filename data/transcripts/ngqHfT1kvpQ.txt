[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   you could be like developing better AI algorithms and AI chips, manufacturing them mostly using
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.920]   robots, using those to come up with even better designs, and then you could also be designing
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.560]   like more and more efficient solar panels, using those to collect more and more energy to power
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.680]   your AIs. So you like a lot of the crucial pieces here just actually don't seem all that likely to
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.760]   be bottlenecked. And then also at the point where you have something that has the ability to have
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.080]   like creative new scientific hypotheses the way a human does, which is a debate over whether we
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.640]   should ever expect that and when, but once you have that I think you should figure there's just
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.400]   a lot of ways to get around all your other bottlenecks because you have this potentially
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.600]   massive population of thinkers looking for them. And so an example is you could with enough fire
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.640]   power, enough energy, enough AI, enough analysis, you could probably find a way to simulate a lot
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.300]   a lot of the experiments you need to run, for example.
