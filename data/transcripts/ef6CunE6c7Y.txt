[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   2020, the year of the Great Lockdown, leading to what some are now calling the Great Coronavirus
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.400]   Recession. It was triggered by a strategic wager, sacrificed economic momentum in order
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.240]   to physically distance people, all with the goal of starving and killing off a spreading
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.020]   virus. It was a huge gamble, and it hurt. Our Great Coronavirus Recession has been compared
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.360]   to the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009, even to the Great Depression of 1929 to 1933. Looking
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.000]   forward, some think the economy will bounce back to normal as soon as the virus is under
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.360]   control. Others are less optimistic and see a long road ahead. But the recession is here,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.600]   and it will remain until God is done with it. We talked about this a couple of weeks
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.440]   back when I mentioned John Piper preached a sermon titled "What is the Recession for?"
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.160]   He preached it in the previous recession, back in February 1st, 2009. The Dow had been
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.440]   dropping but had not yet bottomed out by the time he preached the sermon. The entire sermon
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.680]   is worth listening to, but I especially want to go back to the beginning of that sermon.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.800]   Here's how Pastor John began it.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:17.520]   Father, our heart's desire now is that we not waste this recession. Forbid that we would
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   let it go by with a preoccupation of anxiety or grumbling or clever financial maneuvering.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.760]   Oh God, grant, I pray, that our ears would be open to what you are saying to the world.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:47.840]   In France, in Tokyo, in New York, in Brasilia, may our eyes be open to what you are saying
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:57.600]   and doing. Don't let us sleep through the recession. May we learn, may we grow, may
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:08.880]   we hear, may we know your plan. Come, be our teacher in these days. I pray in Jesus' name,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.120]   Amen.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.280]   So this is a message about the recession and God's purposes in it. And when I use the term
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   "recession," I don't have any careful, sophisticated definition in mind. I don't even know what
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.680]   the definition of a recession is. You hear it on the radio, so I think I know what they're
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:39.800]   talking about. I mean the financial setbacks like business slowdown, decreasing profits,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:51.240]   massive layoffs, joblessness, thousands of foreclosures, personal and business bankruptcies,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:00.480]   loss of retirement funds. I got a letter from the BGC today, my little white sheet, 29.97%
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.840]   lower than the last little white sheet I got from the retirement people down at the BGC.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:15.480]   That's the sort of thing I mean by recession. And now more and more, all of the social and
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:24.920]   political upheavals that will accompany it. Witness France, for example, and probably
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:33.360]   more on the way. So God is sovereign, which is why you can speak in terms of purposes.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.960]   God is sovereign over these things. He foresees them all. He causes or permits them all. And
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:49.000]   when he foresees and he causes or permits, it is always by design. So whatever comes
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.240]   to pass, comes to pass by God's design. However it comes to pass. The lot is cast in the lap.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:06.520]   Every decision is from the Lord in Las Vegas. Many are the plans of the mind of a man, but
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.800]   the purpose of the Lord will stand on Wall Street. The Lord brings the council of the
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:21.160]   nations to nothing. He frustrates the plans of the peoples in Switzerland. The Lord declares
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.480]   the end from the beginning saying, "My council shall stand. I will accomplish all my purpose
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.800]   everywhere." So this is the foundation of understanding that we have when we ask, "So
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:45.280]   what are you up to today? What are the purposes of God in the recession?" And we're not left
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.560]   without an answer. There are many answers, but not all of them. God is up to billions
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.600]   and billions of things that you don't know about, I don't know about, we won't know about
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.440]   until we get to heaven. We trust Him for those, but He's up to five or six or a hundred things
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.240]   that we do know about because they're in the Bible. So those are the ones I want to talk
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.360]   about because those are the ones we have some authority to talk about and they're not unclear.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.480]   I have time perhaps to do five. Here they are. I'll state them and then we'll unpack
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.440]   them. Number one, He intends in this recession to expose hidden sin and to bring us to repentance
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:33.040]   and cleansing. Number two, He intends to wake us up, I'm thinking us in the West in particularly,
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.760]   to the constant and desperate condition of the developing world where they always have
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:48.360]   mega recession and nothing else. Number three, He intends to relocate the roots of our joy
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:57.280]   in His grace and not in our goods, in His mercy and not in our money, in His worth and
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:06.200]   not in our wealth. Number four, He intends to advance His saving mission in the world
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:13.320]   and spread the gospel like wildfire and grow His church precisely at a time when they have
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.680]   least resources to do it. And number five, He intends for the church to care for its
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:28.560]   hurting members and to grow in the gift of love so that no one is in need in the church
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.600]   of Jesus Christ, period.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.200]   Amen. I would encourage you to listen to the entire message from February 1st, 2009 titled,
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.880]   What is the recession for? Some of God's purposes. You can find it online at DesiringGod.org.

[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:07.280]   While does John Piper deny personal assurance, does he deny that Christians can enjoy assurance?
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.600]   Next time we'll need to address a quote that's found its way all over the internet attributed
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.480]   to him. That's next time on Friday. I'm Tony Reinke and we will see you then.
