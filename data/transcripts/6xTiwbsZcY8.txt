[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   I know there are lots of different scholarship programs outside of schools.
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.960]   How does someone even begin to put together a plan for
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.320]   finding scholarship and Merit Aid?
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.080]   You go to tamingthehighcostofcollege.com/scholarships.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.120]   I have the scholarship guide for busy parents and I'm just launching it this week.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.520]   But the goal of it is so you can learn enough to know about what types of
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.160]   scholarships are right fit for you.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.800]   I mean, I had a family fill out 41 scholarship applications and they
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.920]   won seven for $39,000, but they're the exception.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.720]   They're not the rule, right?
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.960]   And if you're going to work that hard at it, you need to
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.960]   know what you're getting into.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.200]   And that's the reality, right?
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.760]   Is families that should work that hard at it, because they could be successful,
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.400]   run out of time because they don't start early enough and therefore
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.440]   they don't do the 40 applications.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200]   They do six or five or zero.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.520]   And then other times families, students are busy, parents are busy.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520]   Somebody has to do all the hard work for scholarships,
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.720]   and it could be worth it.
