[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.620]   Pastor John joins us today over Skype, remotely, even though today's question
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.420]   comes in to us from a pastor not far from you, Pastor John. He writes, "Pastor
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.300]   John, hello. I'm a pastor of a small congregation in Minneapolis. As we
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.500]   endured the inability to gather in person as a congregation in the midst of
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.860]   the virus, I emailed the church weekly, slowly working through the questions in
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.500]   the New City Catechism. It raised again a question that has been gnawing at me for
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.020]   a number of years. Specifically, what does it mean that the Son was begotten by the
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:46.820]   Father and not made? Why this distinction and why does it matter so much today?"
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.860]   Well, hello, brother, fellow lover of Minneapolis, our sad city, our sinful city.
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:02.420]   The early church had to settle certain really crucial disputes over the nature
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.620]   of Christ, and one of those disputes came to a head in the fourth century when a
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:17.660]   group called the Arians, A-R-I-A-N-S, argued that Jesus Christ was created, made, and
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.780]   was not God. The summary and the end of that dispute was the Council of Nicaea,
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.820]   and it was formulated, I'll just read a little section of it, "We believe in one
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.420]   Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father, only begotten, that
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.740]   is, of the substance of the Father, God of God, light of light, true God of true
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.620]   God," and then comes the phrase, "begotten, not made," clearly in the face of the
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.340]   Arians, "of one substance with the Father, through whom all things were made." Now
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.620]   that has been, and is today, the historic biblical Orthodox position of the church
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.340]   throughout history. I believe that what that says is true. The phrase "begotten,
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.420]   not made" comes from that Council of Nicaea, the Creed of Nicaea. So we now
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.640]   should ask, since the Bible and not creeds are our final authority, though we
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.940]   really esteem, I esteem highly, and love to ponder the wisdom of the creeds, is
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.580]   it biblical, and why does it matter? I think a compelling case can be made
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.860]   biblically from the first 14 verses of the Gospel of John that that phrase,
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.940]   "begotten, not made," is biblical. So John begins like this, "In the beginning was the
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:12.460]   Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He," this Word is a person,
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:23.180]   "was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:32.180]   was not anything made that was made." That's verses 1 through 3 of John 1. And
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.740]   then he adds verse 14, "That Word," the Word, "became flesh," so we're talking
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:46.260]   Jesus Christ, "that Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen His glory,
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.460]   glory as of the only," and the old King James said, "only begotten," I'll come back to
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:01.020]   that, "Son." So what I'm focusing on here is Sonship is introduced. What he called
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.540]   Word in verse 1, he calls Son in verse 14. Son from the Father, full of grace and
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.220]   truth. Now there's a good deal of dispute over whether the term, Greek term,
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:21.940]   monogenous, means only, only Son, or only begotten Son. Here's the catch, and I want
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.980]   all just ordinary, run-of-the-mill, faithful pastors and teachers to take
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:36.020]   heart, I don't think the truth of the doctrine of begotten not made depends on
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.780]   the translation of that verb. If it did, we would be in the middle of a
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:50.060]   dispute that continues. What is essential is that in the first three verses of
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:58.760]   this gospel, the Word of God is said to be God, and to be with God. In the
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.540]   beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word was with God, meaning
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.780]   you have two persons, God and the Word of God, and the second person, the Word of
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:22.540]   God, is God, and with God. And then it says that through the Word everything
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:33.020]   was made that was made, and that precise wording rules out the possibility that
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:42.940]   the Word of God itself was made, because everything that is in the category of
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:52.900]   made, or coming into being, was in fact brought into being, was made by the Word,
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:02.460]   which means he's not in that category, he was not made. Then verse 14 uses
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.980]   sonship language, quite apart from whether you say only son or only begotten
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.500]   son, he's son, sonship language to describe the relationship between God
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:23.380]   and the Word. Not only is the Word God, the Word is also Son of God, which means
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:30.980]   that what is said about the Word applies to the Son, and what was said about the
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:40.380]   Word was, he was not made. So how then does the Son exist? As Son, not as Father,
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:47.380]   but as Son. If we just stay with the language of Son and Father, the answer
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.060]   would be, not made but begotten, that's what sons are, sons are begotten, that's
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:01.500]   what it means to be the son of a father. But this begetting of the Son clearly
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:10.420]   then is very unique, I mean it's really different, because this Son, this Word, had
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:19.180]   no beginning. In the beginning was God, the Word of God was there, and God was
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.980]   there, and the two of them were eternally there. God was the Word, the Word was God.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:33.620]   They had no beginning. He was always there with God as God. So the text itself
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:42.300]   pushes us to the conclusion that the peculiar kind of begetting that we're
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:51.260]   talking about is an eternal begetting. There never was a time when the Son did
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:59.420]   not exist, and yet he is Son and not Father. They're not reversible, ever, in
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:05.540]   the New Testament. And the Christian Church is right to argue that it is
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:15.300]   fitting to speak of this eternally existent Son, who is God, and yet is not
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:22.340]   the Father. He has been eternally begotten by the Father, not coming into
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:28.540]   being, but eternally begotten. So the point stressed, both biblically and
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:39.020]   confessionally, is that eternal begetting of the Son secures the Son's very same
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:47.660]   exact nature with the Father. That's the point of Hebrews 1.3. He is the radiance
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:54.060]   of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature. Or Philippians 2.6,
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:01.820]   "Though he was in the form of God, he did not count equality with God a thing to
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:08.980]   be grasped." Now, C.S. Lewis was really criticized for trying to make things
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.740]   understandable for ordinary people, but most of us bless him for it, right?
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:20.220]   And here's what he wrote, "When you beget, you beget something of the same kind as
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:27.540]   yourself. A man begets human babies, a beaver begets little beavers, and a bird
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:34.420]   begets eggs which turn into little birds. But when you make, you make something
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:42.340]   different, a different kind from yourself. A bird makes a nest, a beaver builds a
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:51.340]   dam, a man makes a wireless set." He's writing what, 80 years ago? That's an
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:57.420]   essential part of what the doctrine intends to preserve. The Son is not a
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:03.700]   creature, he's not made, he's not different from the very essence and
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.700]   nature of God. Or, if you want to move from Lewis and jump in at the deep end
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:14.580]   of the pool with Jonathan Edwards, let me read you what Edwards says in his
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.780]   attempt not to explain to ordinary people, although I guess he was, and yet
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.740]   he pushes the limits of our mental capacities, but I think it's valuable to
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:28.780]   hear what Edwards has to say about this. Here's what he says, "As God, with perfect
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:37.420]   clearness, fullness, and strength, understands himself, views his own essence,
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:48.820]   that idea which God hath of himself is absolutely himself. This representation
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:56.140]   of the divine nature and essence is the divine nature and essence again, so that
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:03.900]   by God's thinking of the deity, the deity must certainly be generated.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:13.020]   Thereby, there is another person begotten. There is another infinite, eternal,
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:23.700]   almighty, and most holy, and the same God, the very same divine nature. And this
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:30.420]   person is the second person in the Trinity, the only begotten and dearly
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:40.060]   beloved Son of God." End of Edwards. Now I think it is faithful and true to speak
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:48.180]   of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, as eternally begotten but not made, and yet
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:56.060]   never having a beginning, and being the very nature of God. Now does it matter?
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.700]   That's the question at the end that he asks, "Can you help me
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:06.860]   understand what it means, and why would we devote a summer to it?" It does
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:14.300]   matter. Yes, I will only mention one of many reasons that it matters. Paul and
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:23.140]   the writer to the Hebrews show how the full deity of Christ, begotten, not made,
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:29.980]   is interwoven with his work of redemption. There wouldn't be redemption
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:37.980]   without this truth. Colossians 119, "For in him all the fullness of God was
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:47.180]   pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:54.660]   on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross." Those go together.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:00.060]   You can't have the one without the other. If the fullness of deity isn't there,
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.340]   reconciliation by the blood of this being isn't there. And here's Hebrews 1:3,
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:10.580]   "He is the radiance of the glory of God, the exact imprint of his nature. He
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:16.740]   upholds the universe by the word of his power, after making purification for sins
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:23.460]   he sat down at the right hand of the majesty." In other words, there is no
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:32.340]   salvation without the deity of Christ. If the Son of God was made instead of being
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:40.220]   eternally begotten in the very nature of God, we are still in our sins and
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:45.380]   biblical salvation does not exist. That's really helpful. Thank you, Pastor
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:51.620]   John. And a wireless set, is that a radio or a TV? I think it's a radio.
