[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   We resume our consideration of the Book of Revelation. You remember, I take it most of
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.480]   you, that in our consideration of this doctrine of the last things and in a special manner
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.560]   the doctrine of the Second Coming of our Lord, we have come to consider the teaching of this
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.900]   book which obviously is one of the crucial New Testament biblical doctrine books with
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:36.920]   regard to this particular doctrine. And last week I gave you some account of the three
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:46.400]   main schools of interpretation. It is notoriously a difficult book to interpret. And there are
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.520]   three main schools of interpretation which we of necessity have to consider. I'm adopting
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.600]   the policy, the practice, which I've adopted with other passages of scripture and indeed
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.160]   with the entire consideration of this subject, namely that I'm not merely putting before
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.680]   you what I conceive to be the right view, I'm also presenting other views, other views
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.720]   which are well known and familiar to many and which at any rate have been before Christian
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.240]   people for the last 120 years or so and which therefore I believe we should consider very
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.720]   carefully. I would therefore ask, continue to ask, that we shall all compare these different
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.400]   views and that we shall do our utmost to balance our reading and our thinking with regard to
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.000]   this great question. Well now, you remember the three main views were these, the Preterists.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.960]   The Preterist view is the one that says that all that we have in the book of Revelation
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.840]   has already happened. Indeed it happened in the first three centuries of the Christian
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.120]   era. Then there was the exact opposite of that, the Futurists view, which tells us that
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.320]   the book is really three books in a sense, that John was told to write the things that
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.760]   he'd seen, the vision, the things that are, namely the letters to the seven churches,
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.920]   and the things that shall be hereafter, from chapter four to the end, all of which you
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:35.700]   remember they relegate to the future, immediately before our Lord's return. Their view is that
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.160]   none of the things from chapter four to the end have yet happened, that all these things
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.040]   are yet to take place. And you remember we indicated that there are two schools in that
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.440]   one school, those who believe in the preliminary rapture and those who don't. But both sections
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.360]   are Futurists. They both say these things are reserved for a day yet to come, that seventieth
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.440]   missing lost week of Daniel's prophecy in chapter nine.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.560]   And the third view was the Historicist view, which again you remember we were able to split
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.180]   up into different sections. Those who believe, with the Reformers, with most of the Reformers
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.400]   of the sixteenth century, that the book is just a praese of church history. Then the
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.480]   Continuous Historicist, who say, no, no, it isn't that, it is actual history following
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.720]   in a chronological order and sequence. And then the third view, which regards it as a
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.840]   kind of spiritual view of the main elements in the life and history of the church.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.200]   Well now, we come this evening to try to evaluate those different views, because of necessity
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:04.240]   we must do so if we are to arrive at any conclusion at all. I am sure that we all feel that we
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.600]   are engaged in something which is vital, and that we do not recognize ourselves in the
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.280]   description given this week of those who spend a good deal of their time in investigating
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:26.240]   and examining the dustbins of biblical prophecy. That surely is an utterly unscriptural, not
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.320]   to say unchristian view of biblical prophecy and of our interest in it. We look at these
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.920]   things because we believe that God has given them to us. Not merely that we may be interested
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:49.840]   in times and seasons, not merely that we may be animated by some morbid, carnal curiosity,
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.120]   but rather that as God's people we may have an understanding of the times, and above all
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.640]   that we may be strengthened in our faith to face the enemy that is confronting us, the
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.040]   battle that we are already waging, and the things that may be lying in store for us.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.960]   We are not interested as such in times and seasons, but we are interested that we should
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.000]   have the full benefit of what God has graciously been pleased to give us.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.800]   Well now then, let us look at this Preterist view. I do not think we need spend much time
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.440]   with this. It seems to me that this is a view which is clearly impossible in terms of the
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:39.920]   book itself. For the book obviously takes us on to the very end of time. It even tells
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:48.120]   us time shall be no more. It takes us on to the destruction of the devil and all his powers
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.240]   and the instruments that he uses. The dragon himself and these various beasts, the book
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:02.400]   deals with their final destruction. So that obviously it cannot be right to say that this
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.200]   book has only a reference to the things that were then confronting the early Christian
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.680]   Church and things which were come to an end when the Roman Empire became officially Christian.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.920]   As I pointed out to you last week, it was a view put forward by a Jesuit, and we can
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.520]   well understand his motives. It was to direct attention away from the Church of Rome and
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:33.200]   the Protestant identification of the papacy with certain of these symbols. There is no
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.600]   need therefore, I say, to waste any further time with it. If you take the book and let
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:45.400]   its message speak to you, you must agree that it cannot possibly be the correct interpretation.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.000]   So that we hurry on to consider the second view, the futurist view. Again I reminded
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.800]   you that this was first put forward by another Jesuit in the early part of the seventeenth
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.740]   century. But the important question is, what do we make of this view? Well, now let me
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:09.920]   put certain objections to it. I gave you the arguments for it last week. The main arguments,
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:17.680]   you remember, are their interpretation of the nineteenth verse of the first chapter
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.360]   and the first verse of the fourth chapter. You remember, the nineteenth verse says, "Write
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.320]   the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter."
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.160]   Now they interpret that, you remember, in this way. The things that thou hast seen,
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:41.000]   that is the vision recorded in this first chapter. The things that are, that is what
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   you get in chapters two and three, we are told. This progressive history of the Christian
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.520]   Church, leading up to the very end of the Church age, that is their interpretation of
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:02.480]   that, "And the things which shall be hereafter," we are told, "are these things which, from
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.320]   John's standpoint, were going to happen at least some two thousand years afterwards,
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:14.560]   with this tremendous interval of the Church era. And these things don't begin to happen
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.200]   until that has ended." And likewise, you remember, the argument based upon the first
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.660]   verse of chapter four, where John heard this voice saying, "Come up hither, and I will
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:35.720]   show thee things which must be hereafter." Now then, let us consider, I say, some objections
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:43.240]   to that view. And I would divide them into general and particular. What are the general
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:52.120]   objections? Well, here are some of them. One general objection to that view is that it
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:09:01.640]   seems to rob the book of its main value for the saints of John's own age. Now John obviously
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:08.560]   was writing to the men and women in the churches at that time. And surely there was some object
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.840]   in writing the book then and for them. It was meant to comfort them and to encourage
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:19.240]   them and to strengthen them. But according to the futurist view, it really has no such
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.120]   comfort to offer to the people of John's age. Indeed, it has no comfort either for
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.320]   the people of subsequent ages. And in a sense, it doesn't seem to have very much comfort
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:37.760]   even for us. If the bulk of the book is to be transferred to the future, how exactly
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:44.400]   does it help me in my fight and in my contest now? Still more so, I say, how could it have
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:52.000]   helped the people in John's own age and generation? That is a general objection which
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.760]   I think is worthy of consideration. The book clearly was meant for the people to whom it
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:04.640]   was written and to whom it was sent. Another general objection, very similar to that, is
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:12.600]   this. There can be no doubt at all that the main function of prophecy is to strengthen
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:20.720]   our faith by showing us that the things which have been foretold rarely come to pass.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.520]   Now let me give you an illustration to show you what I mean. Do you remember how the Apostle
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.420]   Peter puts it in his second epistle in the first chapter? He has been comforting these
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.360]   Christians and he said, "Well," he said, "we haven't preached to you cunningly
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.000]   devised fables." He said, "I can give you proof of that." And his proof is, you
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.520]   remember, that he and his two fellow disciples were up on the holy mount with our Lord and
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:53.240]   they were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honor and
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.680]   glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory saying, 'This
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:05.440]   is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.'" Now that's my evidence, says Peter, but
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.680]   listen, he goes on, "But we have also," he says, "a more sure word of prophecy.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.240]   Whereunto we do well that he take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place,"
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:23.960]   etc. Now what he means there is this. You needn't even base it upon my testimony,
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:32.320]   says Peter. There is something even better, a word of prophecy made sure, made yet more
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:38.600]   sure. Read your Old Testament prophecies, he says. See how they prophesy the coming
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   of the Son of God, then look at the facts. That's the thing to strengthen faith, says
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:51.800]   Peter. Prophecy is designed for that end, that the people who see its fulfillment are
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:57.000]   strengthened. They say, "Here is something on which I can rest my feet as an impregnable
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.760]   rock. The things that were prophesied have actually come to pass."
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.960]   Now if it's right to say that that is the main function of prophecy, and it obviously
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:15.400]   must be, well then this futurist view of the book of Revelation seems to deny that altogether
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.560]   with regard to this book. Because if it is true to say that all Christians will have
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.960]   been taken out of the world before these things come to pass, how can this possibly help any
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.280]   Christian? It will be of no value to them at all, because they will have gone, they
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.360]   will have been taken up, they will have gone out of the world. So that from the Christian
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:42.420]   standpoint this book has and can have no value whatsoever.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:52.680]   Now that, I say, is something that runs contrary to the general function and purpose of prophecy.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:59.920]   Well that brings us on to another argument. It seems to me that this view contradicts
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:08.720]   what we may well call the analogy of the scriptures. Now I mean something like this. Many of you
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:18.600]   will remember how several weeks ago we tried to show that the first beast in Revelation
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:26.120]   13 is obviously identical with the fourth beast in the seventh chapter of Daniel. And
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:32.080]   everybody really has agreed about that. The descriptions are so similar. It seems quite
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:38.840]   clear. The fourth beast in the seventh of Daniel is identical with the first beast in
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:47.320]   chapter 13 of Revelation. Well now, you see, because of that, our friends who take the
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:56.680]   futurist view have to say that the Roman Empire is going to be reconstituted again. It is
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:02.160]   clear that the fourth beast in Daniel is the Roman Empire. That is obvious. The book of
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:08.120]   Daniel itself tells us that everybody has agreed about that. So that then, you see,
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:16.240]   in order to get out of the difficulty, they are driven to say that the Roman Empire is
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:24.040]   going to be formed again, re-established again. And that surely is something which should
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:32.240]   give us pause. Any interpretation which necessitates anything like that, because other interpretations
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.760]   do not produce any such necessity at all, surely any such interpretation should become
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:47.080]   suspect at that point. And coupled with that, take an argument like this. Take those descriptions
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:55.420]   of those beasts and those kingdoms represented by the beasts in the book of Daniel. Now,
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:01.660]   you will notice in each case that each one of these empires, these dynasties represented
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:09.760]   by these beasts, takes quite a long time to appear and to develop and to function and
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   to disappear. All of them take a good deal of time. But according to this futurist interpretation,
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:24.040]   you see, these various beasts that are described in the thirteenth chapter of the book of Revelation
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:30.120]   have to come into being and do all that they do in the space of just some seven years,
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.480]   and perhaps not even that. Now, there I say something that contradicts
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:41.560]   the analogy of Scripture. These powers, these forces that operate against God's people
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:47.240]   in Scripture, do not suddenly crowd their activity into seven years. No, no, some of
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:54.080]   them extend over centuries. So if you are governed by the analogy of Scripture, it is
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.960]   quite impossible to believe that what you find described in the thirteenth chapter of
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.680]   Revelation is thus, I say, going to be crowded into this short space of seven years or even
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:10.800]   less. Indeed, if you take what we are told about the activity of these beasts in the
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:17.480]   thirteenth of Revelation itself, I think you will see at once that obviously it is an activity
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:24.200]   that is extended over a considerable period. Therefore, I argue that this view, which would
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.760]   put the whole, practically, of the contents of the book into this crowded seven years,
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:37.440]   is something that denies the clear, ordinary method of Scripture itself.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:44.960]   Another general objection to the book is this one, that it rarely destroys the unity of
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:54.680]   the book. You see, it virtually makes it into three books—things which thou hast seen,
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:01.640]   things which are, things which shall yet be or be hereafter. And you see, they divide
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.440]   absolutely between these three. There is, as I say, an interval of almost, well, two
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:13.320]   thousand years and perhaps more between the second and the third. Now that, I say, is
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:20.680]   to separate these sections in an unnatural manner and really to destroy the unity of
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:29.960]   the book. And surely this is something which one need be in very little doubt about. Surely
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:36.960]   this book is one. Surely there is an essential unity to the whole book. And I think I can
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:45.480]   even prove to you it in this way. The vision in chapter one, after all, is in close connection
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:51.480]   with the letters to the seven churches. There is no difficulty about establishing that.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:58.400]   If you notice the way in which all these letters to the seven churches start, you will notice
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:05.380]   that in each one of them there is given a description of our Lord. And it is most interesting
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:11.280]   and important to notice that the descriptions, every one of them, are borrowed from what
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:17.000]   we are told about him in the vision in chapter one. Take, for instance, unto the angel of
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.760]   the church of Ephesus in chapter two, "These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:28.400]   in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks." That
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.960]   is a description from chapter one. And to the angel of the church of Smyrna we read,
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:39.160]   "These things saith the first and the last, which was dead and is alive." Again, it
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.440]   is borrowed from what we are told about him in chapter one. And it is the same with all
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:50.440]   the letters to the seven churches. So that I suggest to you that you cannot artificially
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.600]   divide in this way and say, "Now, the vision in chapter one is one thing. Chapters two
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.480]   and three are really something quite different. Chapters four to the end are yet different."
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:06.560]   No, no. There is this unity. It is the same person. It is the Lord in the midst of the
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:14.360]   churches. And the same terms are used in chapters two and three as are used in chapter one.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:21.800]   But still more striking is this, that the very selfsame terms are even used in chapter
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:30.280]   19. In three verses, let me remind you of them. You get it in verse 12, where we are
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:37.880]   told that his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns. That is
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:44.480]   again borrowing from chapter one. The same thing is found in chapter 15. "Out of his
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.940]   mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations." That again is
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:57.640]   from chapter one. And again in verse 21, "And the remnant were slain with the sword of him
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:03.080]   that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth."
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:11.720]   Now, surely that ought to be sufficient to establish this principle of the essential
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:18.900]   unity of the book. It is not three separate books, three separate messages that were simply
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.720]   stitched together, as it were. No, no. It is the same idea. It is the same person, and
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:31.080]   he is described and depicted in the same way. It is one. It is a whole. And therefore, a
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:37.080]   view or an interpretation which divides it up into three is something that surely is
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.600]   doing violence to it.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:48.640]   Then my last general objection I would put in this form. The futurist view postpones
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:55.400]   the kingdom to the future. It says, "No, the kingdom of God has not yet come. This
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:01.360]   is the church age." You remember the classification that our Lord, when he was here preaching,
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:07.520]   he offered the kingdom. And because the kingdom was rejected by the Jews, well, then it was
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.640]   put into abeyance. And the church age came in, and there is no more talk, they say, about
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.600]   the kingdom, and will be none until the end.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:24.080]   Now here surely is something that we have to consider before we accept that view. Take
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.840]   the sixth verse of the first chapter of this book of Revelation. It reads like this in
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:37.160]   this authorised version, "And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father."
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.400]   But undoubtedly there the revised version is better, which reads, "And hath made us
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:52.680]   a kingdom, priests unto God and his Father." We have already been made a kingdom. The kingdom
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:22:00.920]   has already come. Indeed, John says that explicitly in the ninth verse. Listen, "I, John, who
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:11.560]   also am your brother and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:17.440]   was in the isle which is called Patmos." Now there is John himself saying that he is
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.760]   in the kingdom of Jesus Christ with these other Christian people to whom he was sending
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:30.760]   his message. So that surely it is wrong to say that the kingdom is yet to come. No, no,
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.480]   the church is a part of the kingdom. We are in the kingdom already. We are made a kingdom.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:42.880]   And John was with the Christians in the kingdom at that very time. It is not right to renegade
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:50.040]   the kingdom or to postpone it to the future. This particular form of the kingdom is already
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.920]   present. The kingdom of God has come. The kingdom of God is coming. The kingdom of God
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.960]   is yet to come. It is to come in a visible external form. But the kingdom of God is already
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:09.400]   here. The kingdom of God is where Christ reigns. And he reigns in the hearts of all his people.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:16.020]   He reigns in the church, the true church, the invisible church, the spiritual church.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.720]   So that any view that relegates the kingdom to the future seems to me to violate these
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:26.920]   statements in verses 6 and 9 of this first chapter.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:33.140]   But now let us come to certain particulars. They are very important and it seems to me
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:40.200]   full of interest. Now here is a difficulty, a great difficulty as far as I am concerned.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   Let me read you the first verse of the book of Revelation.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:52.080]   The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:24:02.160]   which must shortly, shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:10.720]   unto his servant John. Now you Greek scholars, if you take the word translated shortly and
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.400]   follow it right through the scriptures, you will find that it is always translated as
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:26.640]   either shortly or quickly or soon or speedily. If that is so, why should it suddenly be given
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:32.760]   the meaning which says that shortly really means something which is to happen in, well,
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:40.320]   perhaps two thousand years or even more. The book opens with the word shortly come to pass.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.520]   It does not mean, I do not mean by that that everything is going to happen shortly, but
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:49.000]   what is contained in the book is going to start shortly and it is going to continue,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.720]   it is going to go on. But its beginning must be shortly. Not only that, look at the statement
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:04.560]   which is made in the third verse. This is, you see, the introduction to the book.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.800]   To show unto his servant things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.880]   it by his angel unto his servant John, who bare record of the word of God and of the
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:21.840]   testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Then listen to it. Blessed is
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.540]   he, says John, that readeth, and remember that applies to the people of John's age.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.800]   They were to be blessed as the result of reading it. Therefore it surely has some relevance
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.760]   to them. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy. And
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:45.600]   keep those things which are written therein. Now you notice that the people of John's
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:51.680]   age were not only to read it and to hear it, but they were to keep those things which were
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.760]   written therein. It applied to them, they were to do something about it. But then he
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:06.640]   adds, for the time is at hand. But you see, if this other view is right at hand, it means
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:12.000]   after an interval of perhaps two thousand years of the church age. But it's at hand,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:20.440]   says John. It's about to happen, shortly at hand. Now surely a view which has to give
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:30.040]   an entirely new and hitherto never used meaning and signification to these words is a view
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.880]   that must justify itself very powerfully by some other arguments before we can be expected
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:41.960]   to believe it. But let us go on to the nineteenth verse, which as I've indicated is the sheet
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:48.320]   anchor of this futurist view. You remember the threefold division, "Write the things
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:55.200]   which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter."
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:03.840]   Now what about this? Well, it seems that the answer must be something like this. Notice
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:12.400]   that in verse eleven we read this. Perhaps I ought to go a bit further back. John says,
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.800]   "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice as of a
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:28.120]   trumpet saying, 'I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, and what thou seest,
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:34.840]   write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia, unto Ephesus,
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   Myrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, etc." Now the thing I'm anxious to emphasize here is this.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:53.480]   John is told that before he is given the vision of our Lord, he is told to send what he has
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:28:01.040]   seen unto all these churches before he sees the vision. In other words, John's message
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:07.440]   to the seven churches is not only the message to the seven churches, it not only includes
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.960]   even the vision that he was later given of the Lord himself, surely this is a reference
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.880]   to the whole of the contents of the book. A number of things are going to be shown to
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.120]   John. He is going to be given this vision. He is going to be given messages to the seven
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.440]   churches, and other things he is going to be given. Now here in general he is told to
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:34.680]   write this in a book and to send it to the seven churches, send it all. Not simply one
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:40.480]   thing, namely the message to the seven churches. The fact that this instruction is given before
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.600]   the vision seems to me to indicate quite clearly that it is a general introduction for the
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.640]   whole book, the vision, the messages to the churches, and the remainder of the book of
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:29:00.120]   Revelation. That is, how I would answer, the tendency to isolate this statement in this
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:06.440]   verse into three separate discrete books or messages.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:13.360]   Then coming to the second bit, you remember things that are. Now we are told that the
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:19.720]   things that are refers to the messages to the seven churches of Asia that were then
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:29.520]   in existence. Now at this point there is a slight self-contradiction in the futurist
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:37.080]   view. You see, it starts by saying that the things that are, not the things that are going
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:45.160]   to be, but the things that are, has a reference to the then condition of the seven churches.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:53.200]   And yet you remember that they also say that the messages, the letters to the seven churches,
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:59.520]   cover the entire course of church history, starting at the beginning, going on, Sardis
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.000]   you remember, representing the time of the Protestant Reformation, the letter to the
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.880]   church of Laodicea being descriptive of the church at the present time. Well, if that
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:15.960]   is so, of course, the letters to the seven churches do not simply describe things that
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:22.160]   are, but also describe things that shall be hereafter. In other words, the view contradicts
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:29.720]   itself. But of course, the view is entirely wrong for this reason. There is nothing in
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:36.360]   chapters two and three to tell us that the messages to the seven churches are progressive.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.840]   There is nothing which says that, starting with Ephesus, you have the state of the church
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.880]   at that time, and that the letter to the church at Smyrna describes the church at a later
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:52.920]   period. Not at all. There is nothing to indicate that. There is no suggestion whatsoever that
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:58.200]   each one of these follows chronologically after the previous one, and that it takes
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:04.320]   you up to the end of the church age. There is no such suggestion. And you see, the moment
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.360]   you introduce that suggestion, you are in trouble, because it is no longer things that
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:14.200]   are. And yet it is essential to this view to say that chapters two and three only deal
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:19.980]   with things that are, and have nothing to do with things that shall be hereafter. Surely
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:26.160]   that is more or less a conclusive argument. When you realize, I say, that there is no
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:34.240]   such sequence indicated in the chapters themselves, and that it involves you in that contradiction.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:43.480]   And then that brings me to the last statement, the things which shall be hereafter. Now,
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:49.880]   once more, we have to indicate that the word hereafter is, according to this view, given
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:32:00.720]   an entirely new, novel meaning. There is nothing here to tell us that hereafter, in this case,
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.960]   means after a tremendous interval of time. Nothing whatsoever. The word isn't qualified
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:15.400]   at all. It just says hereafter. And surely hereafter just means following. Things following,
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.720]   things that shall follow. Weymouth, in his translation, translates it like that very
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:27.240]   rightly. And yet you see the weight that is attached to this, that hereafter must mean,
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.160]   oh, not things that are now, not things that are about to happen, but there is going to
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:39.560]   be this tremendous gap of the church period, then hereafter sort of spans the centuries.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:47.440]   And yet, in a way, it is straining the meaning of a word to ask it to carry such a signification
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:53.280]   without any indication whatsoever that that is being done.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:58.680]   Very well, there is an attempt in terms of the nineteenth verse of the first chapter
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:08.280]   to deal with this view. Now, that brings us in turn to the first verse of the fourth chapter.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:14.480]   After this I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven. And the first voice which
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:21.120]   I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, Come up hither, and I
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:31.000]   will show thee things which must be hereafter. There it is, the same word again. And once
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.840]   more the same signification is attached to that word hereafter. Ah, they say hereafter
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:46.200]   means after the whole of the church era, after the church has been raptured, that tremendous
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:55.800]   long view of history. Hereafter means just at the end, before our Lord's final manifestation.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:06.960]   But wait a minute. In a most amazing manner, this word hereafter, which comes at the end
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:14.080]   of the verse, is also at the beginning of the verse. Did you notice how it starts? It
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:21.920]   says, after this. Now, in the Greek it is exactly the same words as the word translated
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:31.480]   hereafter. Meta tauta. Meta tauta, I looked and behold. Then you go right through, come
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:39.040]   up hither, and I will show thee things which must be meta tauta. The same at the beginning
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:47.240]   as at the end. But you see, everybody agrees that after this at the beginning doesn't
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.560]   mean after two thousand years, because John would no longer be on earth. This happened
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:57.760]   to John while he was still alive and in the body. After the things he's just been describing,
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:04.800]   says John, after that I looked and behold. Now, after this means, well, a short interval
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.960]   of time. It certainly cannot mean two thousand. Well then, why do we ask that it should have
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:15.600]   this entirely different meaning at the end of the verse? Surely it's after this at
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:21.040]   the end and at the beginning. And John is told, I will show thee things which must be
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:30.520]   after this. Things which are shortly to happen. The same meaning running all the way along.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:36.600]   It means, therefore, after these things. Again, I would remind you that it doesn't mean that
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:44.480]   they all are going to happen suddenly or immediately. But it does mean that the things which were
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:49.800]   shown to John were going to start happening very quickly. And I want to suggest to you
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:55.640]   when I come to a positive explanation that they did start happening very quickly. They
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:00.920]   began then and they've continued and they are yet to be completed. But it does seem
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:07.440]   to me to be straining language and violating language to give two different meanings to
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:13.680]   the same expression at the beginning and the end of the verse and to put into it this tremendous
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:21.920]   interval of time. Surely we must translate the expression in the same way at the end
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:28.880]   as we have already done at the beginning. So much for the first verse of the fourth
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:36.760]   chapter. But as far as I am concerned, the most conclusive argument of all is the argument
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:44.000]   of chapter twelve, which we have read together at the beginning. Now I am not going to go
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.880]   into details about this chapter tonight. I simply want to say this. Is it not quite obvious
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:37:01.080]   that that chapter gives us a description of something that happened at the incarnation?
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:08.720]   Something that happened when our Lord first came into this world. Now that's a very
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:16.280]   important fact because you will find that in chapters ten and eleven the story is taken
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:23.080]   right up to the end of the age. Time shall be no more. The final end. And yet in chapter
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:27.960]   twelve we go right back to the beginning, to something that happened when our Lord first
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:35.640]   came into this world. But in any case it is surely quite impossible from the futurist's
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:41.120]   standpoint. You cannot say that the whole of this book from chapter four to the end
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:47.320]   is entirely to be in the future when you have that astounding description of the birth of
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:53.840]   our Lord and what happened to him and what happened round about that time. That in itself
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:04.320]   surely is sufficient. Chapter twelve belongs to history in the past, the time of the incarnation.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:11.040]   But finally, and this is my last argument, there are expressions in the last chapter
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:16.960]   of the book, chapter twenty-two, which again seem to me to be quite conclusive against
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:27.920]   this futurist view. In verse six and in verse ten you have statements that are of extreme
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:37.400]   significance. "And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true. And the Lord
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:45.280]   God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:54.000]   shortly be done." There it is again, the very expression that you had in chapter one.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:01.400]   These things are shortly to be done. And again in chapter ten we read this, "He saith unto
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:11.640]   me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand." Now
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:17.080]   if you contrast that with what Daniel is told at the end of his book, you will see that
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:24.560]   it is a very powerful argument. Daniel is told to shut up the words and seal the book
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:30.320]   even to the time of the end. In other words, it was made quite plain to Daniel that the
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.680]   things which he had been shown were not to happen in his day, in his generation, that
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:39.760]   an interval was to pass. And we know that almost five centuries did pass before the
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:46.680]   things took place. Daniel is shown that by the command to seal up the book. But here
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:54.360]   John is deliberately and specifically told not to seal up the book. And the reason is
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:40:04.280]   added, "For the time is at hand." In other words, this great book ends in exactly the
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:10.200]   same way as it began. The things that are contained in this book are things that were
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:16.800]   shortly to come to pass. They are things that were at hand on the very threshold. They are
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:23.160]   about to take place. That is given in the general introduction in chapter one. It is
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:32.280]   repeated in the summary at the end in chapter twenty-two. So that for these reasons I suggest
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:41.800]   to you that this book is one. It is a unity. It is a complete whole. And the entire book
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:48.680]   was meant and had relevance for the people of John's age. It is meant for and is relevant
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:54.680]   for every subsequent age of Christian people. And of course the history of the church proves
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:41:00.920]   that God's people in all times of affliction and of adversity have recognized themselves
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:05.920]   in these things, have found their strength from this book. They said, "We are going
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:14.560]   through it as it was prophesied." The Covenanters, the Puritans, and others, this was their book.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:22.040]   And so if you reject that view and that interpretation which divides it into three and says that
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:27.840]   the bulk of it has nothing at all to do with Christians, you see that the book will have
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:35.840]   a new meaning and it will have a new function. And it will provide you with glorious comfort
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:41.520]   and uplift. I hope when I come to give my positive exposition of it that that will become
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:50.980]   still more evident. With regard to the historicist, it seems to me that perhaps the best plan
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:58.460]   at this point is to leave our consideration of that until next time. It will form a convenient
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:06.960]   introduction to my positive exposition of the book. You remember that there are three
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:13.320]   subdivisions of the historicist. The church historical, which says that it is a sort of
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:21.840]   praising of church history. The continuous historicist, and that other view which takes
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:29.100]   it in a more spiritual sense and says that here we are given in this symbolical form
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:38.140]   the main elements in the long history and life of the Christian church. But we have
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:48.560]   done what I regard as extremely important. You can only take this other view on condition
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:55.440]   that you are satisfied that you cannot rest on the futurist view and that the preterist
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:04.480]   view is obviously altogether and entirely untenable. Now we have to do this. We have
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.880]   to deal with what I would call the mechanics of exposition before we can come to a more
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:16.840]   positive presentation where we shall see more clearly, I trust, the spiritual nature and
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:24.640]   the spiritual message of this amazing and remarkable book which God has given to his
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.760]   people. Let us pray.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:37.240]   We thank thee, our heavenly Father, again for thy mercy and for thy kindness and compassion.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:45.920]   O God, we thank thee that thou hast thought about us, thou hast known us and our frame,
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:53.760]   thou understandest our weakness, and thou hast provided for us. O God, we thank thee
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:44:02.560]   for the perfection of the provision that for our minds and hearts and wills thou hast given
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:09.920]   us the very thing we need. And so we pray thee again, so to enlighten our understanding
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:16.760]   by thy Spirit that we shall be enabled to use thy word aright, that it may speak to
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:23.720]   us in a living manner, that our hearts may be warmed by it, and we may be strengthened
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:29.040]   and established and enabled to continue in our journey.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:38.040]   And now, O Lord, receive our prayers as we part from one another. And may the grace of
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:44.280]   the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:52.120]   Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder of this
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:45:01.400]   hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and evermore. Amen.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.480]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
