[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   It's almost certainly the case that Neanderthals were using sounds and some kind of language.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.360]   But some people think that language in its modern form is not that old and might be specific
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.360]   to our lineage.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.960]   There's been one incredibly interesting and weird line of genetic evidence that was so
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.960]   weird.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.840]   They identified sections of the genome that were consistently and very differently turned
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.520]   down or turned up in Neanderthals and modern humans, and there was a huge statistical signal
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.120]   that was very, very surprising, and it was the vocal tract.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.520]   These changes have occurred specifically on our lineage and are absent in both the Neanderthal
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.080]   and Denisovan lineages.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.000]   So if you think this change in the vocal tract is important in language, then maybe that's
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.560]   telling you that the adaptations that humans have are ones that allow us to access a rich
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.440]   amount of shared knowledge and not just to rely on figuring out each thing.
