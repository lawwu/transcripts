[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.880]   - Good Monday morning and welcome back
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.080]   to a new week on the podcast.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.320]   To week number 499 in our history.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.540]   It's amazing.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.560]   And we start week 499 with a question
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.960]   from a listener named Elizabeth,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.320]   who has an interesting question
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.760]   about the saving work of Christ.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.000]   Hi, Pastor John, I am studying 1 Peter,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.480]   going through your lab videos and digging deeper
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.240]   to share with my fellow stay at home moms at church.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.920]   My question pertains to Hutas,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.500]   the Greek word in 1 Peter 1.11 translated subsequent.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.420]   I'm trying to tie together the sufferings of Christ
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.440]   and his subsequent glories.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.800]   Does not seem to simply refer
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.140]   to a chronological progression.
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.840]   Peter very often ties suffering and glory together.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.000]   1 Peter 1, verses six to seven and verse 10,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.440]   chapter two, verse 12, chapter three, verse nine and 14,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.800]   chapter four, verses 12 to 15, chapter five, one
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680]   and verse 10 of chapter five.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.600]   So here's my question.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.520]   Did Jesus have to suffer in public
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.200]   for God to give him those glories?
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.880]   Couldn't Jesus have lived a perfect law abiding
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.960]   substitutionary life for us in total isolation
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.520]   or at least in obscurity?
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.900]   I know he underwent his formal temptations alone.
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.560]   So he could have died serenely,
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.640]   then risen and defeated death and sin,
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.280]   but not by suffering in public.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.240]   Or if he had done this,
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.660]   would he not have received the subsequent glories?
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.920]   Was it required for him to suffer publicly
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920]   and to die early?
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.320]   So then again, what's the subsequent relationship
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.100]   between his public sufferings and his eternal glory?
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.720]   The reason I'm drawn to answer this question,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.880]   even though in one sense,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.000]   it's the kind of what if question
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.720]   that the Bible doesn't really address directly.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.900]   What if Jesus had lived a perfect sinless life
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.460]   and died a natural death at age 85,
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.220]   could that life and death save us?
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.160]   The Bible doesn't spend a lot of time reflecting
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.920]   on that possibility.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.120]   And so you might think, well, that's,
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.080]   why would you even go there?
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.920]   Nevertheless, questions like that
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.720]   in trying to answer this particular question
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.640]   and questions like that,
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.640]   we are led, I think, to ponder the wonder,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.860]   at least I am,
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.860]   the wonder that God did it in fact a certain way,
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.400]   that he planned for his son to suffer agonizingly,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   publicly, extremely,
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.320]   and why he did it that way.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.920]   And that's worth our serious meditation, I think.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.920]   So as I have pondered the question,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.000]   whether our redemption could have been accomplished
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.360]   by the perfection of Christ
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.840]   without the public suffering of a crucifixion,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.240]   I see at least six reasons
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.240]   that the Bible gives for why this could not have happened.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.920]   In other words, why Christ's public,
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.200]   horrific suffering by crucifixion
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   was absolutely necessary for our salvation.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.680]   Now, the first and perhaps the most obvious reason
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.880]   is that these particular sufferings
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.240]   were predestined by God
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.400]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.520]   It was God's eternal plan
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.720]   that his son suffer in this way.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   Acts chapter four, verse 27,
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.920]   "Truly in this city were gathered together
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.640]   "against your holy servant Jesus,
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.340]   "whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate,
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.320]   "along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.440]   "to do whatever your hand and your plan
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.400]   "had predestined to take place."
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.160]   So everything that Herod and Pilate
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.320]   and those Gentile soldiers who drove the nails,
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   the spear and the crucifying mobs,
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.200]   everything they did to Jesus in those last hours
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.920]   was God's plan.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.400]   It had been predestined to take place.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.040]   Was not up for grabs.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.560]   The alternative of a leisurely life
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.400]   and an 85-year-old death was not in the plan.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.000]   That's the first reason it couldn't have happened.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.480]   Second, these sufferings were prophesied in God's word.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.980]   The Old Testament scriptures,
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.980]   which cannot be broken over and over again in the gospels,
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.040]   the details of the final sufferings of Christ
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.680]   are said to be that the scriptures might be fulfilled.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.740]   Matthew 26, 56, Luke 22, 37, Luke 24, 26,
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.560]   John 13, 18, 19, 36.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.200]   For example, He was pierced for our transgression.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.740]   Isaiah 53, 5, pierced.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.400]   Not cancer, not old age, not cardiac arrest.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.720]   He was pierced for our transgression.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.160]   In other words, the horrific public shaming
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.020]   and sufferings of Christ were scripted,
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.440]   scripted down to the details
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.060]   of what would happen to His clothing in the Old Testament.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.160]   If those writings cannot be broken,
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.920]   then the sufferings could not be avoided.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.080]   Third, and this gets closer to the heart of the matter,
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.680]   Hebrews 2:10.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.340]   It was fitting, I'm underlining that word,
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.520]   but a big red circle around that word.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.040]   It's an amazing word.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.600]   It was fitting that He for whom
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.440]   and by whom all things exist
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.040]   in bringing many sons to glory
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.160]   should make the founder of their salvation
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.820]   perfect through suffering.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.020]   This is very profound.
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.120]   And it is worth much study and hours of meditation
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.160]   that God's eternal decision
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.220]   to achieve our salvation
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.780]   through the sufferings of Christ
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.420]   is not arbitrary or whimsical or meaningless,
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.420]   but is owing to a profound fitness,
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.580]   fitness, appropriateness, suitableness,
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.460]   as God considers all things.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.060]   It is appropriate, it is suitable.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.080]   It is ultimately, you might say, beautiful.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.520]   That is, it's in perfect harmony
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.180]   with all of God's other acts and plans.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.180]   And we can spend a lifetime probing into why it is fitting,
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.940]   but let Hebrews 2:10 fly like a great banner
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.220]   over the sufferings of Christ.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.220]   It was fitting, right, good, suitable, beautiful
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.740]   in the mind of God for our salvation to be accomplished
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.500]   this way and not another way.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.380]   Fourth, the death of Jesus was an intentional sacrifice
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:41.500]   given by God similar to the sacrificial offerings
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.620]   of a lamb in the Old Testament.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.620]   Jesus, Paul says, is our Passover lamb,
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.780]   1 Corinthians 5, 7.
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.940]   So just as in the Old Testament,
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.880]   allowing a sheep to get old in the flock
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.940]   and die from mange was not a sacrifice.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.980]   That's not the way it worked.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.460]   You took the sheep and you handed him over
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.060]   with your heart and with an intentionality.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.780]   So Christ growing old in some remote village
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.620]   and dying would not have been a sacrifice of God
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.500]   slitting the throat of the precious lamb of God.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.220]   The word slaughter is used in Revelation
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.180]   for what happened to the lamb
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.480]   and how he accomplished our salvation.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.060]   There was an intentionality to the sacrifice.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.540]   Jesus was offered up on the cross as a sacrifice.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:42.540]   Hebrews 10, 12, when Christ had offered for all time
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.660]   a single sacrifice for sins,
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.840]   he sat down at the right hand of God.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.040]   Fifth, over and over in the New Testament,
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.440]   Christ is said to accomplish his saving work
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.800]   by means of his blood.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   For example, Romans 5, 9,
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.280]   we have now been justified by his blood.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.800]   Hebrews 9, 22, without the shedding of blood,
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.600]   there is no forgiveness of sins.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.640]   I think that's another way to draw out
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.560]   the significance of Christ's death as a sacrifice.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.360]   And then finally, number six,
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.920]   Philippians chapter two describes the humiliation of Jesus
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.360]   from the highest point of equality with God
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.160]   to the lowest point of death,
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   and then he adds even death on a cross.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.600]   As the path from the highest to the lowest,
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.200]   as the path that God rewards
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.800]   with the exaltation of Jesus,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.840]   not only to new life in resurrection,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   but to the acclamation of all the nations as Lord of lords.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.760]   Though he was in the form of God,
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.560]   he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.280]   but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.120]   and being born in the likeness of men
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.600]   and being found in human form,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.960]   he humbled himself by becoming obedient
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.560]   to the point of death.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.200]   And then these words are not throwaway words
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.480]   because they had to be the lowest point
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.540]   to accomplish our redemption,
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.540]   even death on the most despicable, shameful, painful
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.880]   instrument of execution, the cross.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.080]   Therefore, God is highly exalted him.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.640]   And bestowed on him a name that is above every name
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.040]   so that at the name of Jesus,
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.960]   every knee should bow in heaven and on earth
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.520]   and under the earth and every tongue confess
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.040]   that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.060]   There is in God's mind a path to glory for his son.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.860]   And this path was a painful, humiliating death
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.780]   by crucifixion.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.360]   It was the depth of the suffering.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.360]   It was the ignominy of the cross that he endured,
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:24.200]   which was the lowest point that he had to reach
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.760]   for God to reward him with the highest office
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.360]   of lordship as a redeemer.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.460]   Perhaps one last passage to point to the fact
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.800]   that the slaughter of the lamb
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.980]   was what made Jesus a fitting ruler
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.260]   of all the peoples of the world,
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.100]   namely Revelation 5, 9.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.540]   Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.260]   In other words, worthy are you to be the Lord
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.980]   of the unfolding of history.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.580]   For you were slaughtered, sphagizomai,
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.080]   not died in a remote village in 885.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.240]   You were slaughtered.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.620]   And by your blood, you ransomed people for God
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.700]   from every tribe and language and people and nation,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.420]   and you have made them a kingdom priest to our God,
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.220]   and they shall reign on the earth.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.760]   So for those six reasons, at least, I would say,
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.740]   we can say that the glorification of Jesus Christ
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.300]   and the achievement of our salvation
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:39.260]   did indeed require the kind of sufferings he endured,
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.400]   and we will sing the song of the lamb,
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.040]   the lamb, the slaughtered lamb,
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.000]   forever and ever as a tribute
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.680]   to those sufferings and our salvation.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.500]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.800]   Fascinating collection of points here.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.380]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.080]   And thank you for joining us in the podcast today.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.880]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.920]   search our growing archive,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.660]   or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.680]   all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.020]   On today's theme, I want to linger on what it means
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.720]   that Christ's death was fitting.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.860]   It was fitting.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.780]   And we will do so next time with a sermon clip
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.820]   from a 1996 sermon,
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.220]   a clip that comes in the context of talking
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.740]   about the practical implications here
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.220]   in a discussion about gospel drift and how to avoid it.
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.060]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.960]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday for that.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   Thanks for listening.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:48.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
