[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.240]   - We get a lot of emails from listeners every month
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.880]   and I don't think there's a more common question
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.440]   in our inbox than one that we recently received
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.080]   from a listener who asks this,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.720]   hello Pastor John, I read your article
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.960]   about the unforgivable sin of blaspheming
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.680]   against the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.920]   My questions are two.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.340]   Number one, can a true believer whose salvation
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.520]   is eternally secure in Christ still be guilty of blasphemy?
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.120]   And number two, is blaspheming the Holy Spirit
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.760]   the same as grieving the Holy Spirit?
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.920]   Pastor John, what would you say to this listener
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.720]   and many others?
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.160]   - Let's put a couple of key passages in front of us
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.240]   about the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.280]   so we know what we're talking about.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.280]   So here's Mark chapter three, verse 28 to 30.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.280]   Truly I say to you, Jesus is talking,
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.480]   truly I say to you, all sins will be forgiven
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.960]   the children of man.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.200]   And whatever blasphemies they utter,
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.720]   but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.720]   never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.080]   For they were saying, he has an unclean spirit.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.520]   In other words, they were attributing Jesus' deeds
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.320]   to the devil instead of the power of God in him.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.660]   One more text, Luke 12, 10.
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.520]   And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.280]   will be forgiven.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.040]   But the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.320]   will not be forgiven.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.640]   Now, over the span of my ministry,
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.100]   there have been several people, not a lot, but several,
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.640]   probably a lot more people who don't come forward,
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.240]   but these came forward.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.120]   Several people who came to me deeply convinced
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.520]   they had committed the sin against the Holy Spirit
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.600]   and were therefore beyond forgiveness.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.680]   And they were terrified, as you can imagine.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.400]   Now, it seems to me that we need,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.200]   in helping those people deal with what they're saying,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.500]   we need to put alongside the statement
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.600]   that blaspheming the Spirit cannot be forgiven,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.720]   which is there, the many statements
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.160]   that whosoever believes on the Lord,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.320]   Jesus will be saved,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.080]   not whosoever believes
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.200]   if they haven't done a few other things.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.820]   For example, Acts 16, 31,
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.320]   believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.560]   He didn't ask the jailer.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.120]   Now, you ever blasphemed against the Spirit of God?
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.260]   He just said, "If you believe, you'll be saved."
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.200]   And John 6, 40, Jesus said,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.160]   "For this is the will of my Father,
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.160]   that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in Him
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.560]   will have eternal life,
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.240]   and I will raise him up at the last day."
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.440]   So it has always seemed to me
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.040]   that there is something about blaspheming the Spirit,
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.120]   as Jesus intended us to understand it,
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.720]   that has brought a person to the point
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.480]   where they are sinning in such a way
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.480]   that they are unwilling and unable to repent and believe.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.720]   That's why I'm putting the two together.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.880]   Esau would be an example of this in Hebrews 12, 17,
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.520]   where it says, "You know that afterward,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.600]   when he desired to inherit the blessing,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance."
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.920]   That's a literal translation.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.320]   I changed the ESV, "No place of repentance,"
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.840]   which I think means he couldn't do it.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.280]   He couldn't find a place in his heart of genuine repentance,
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.280]   though he sought it with tears.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.480]   So the point here is not that Esau repented
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.200]   and could not be forgiven.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.260]   He couldn't find the place of repentance.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.960]   He had come to such hardness of heart against God,
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.720]   such love for the world,
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.640]   his bowl of cereal against his inheritance.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.280]   He loved the world so much,
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.080]   he couldn't stop loving the world.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.080]   He could find no genuine repentance, and so he perished.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.200]   And his tears were not tears of repentance.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.560]   They were tears of remorse that he couldn't repent.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.840]   So let me give a quote
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.780]   from one of my favorite commentators, Henry Alford,
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.680]   about the sin,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.200]   the unforgivable sin of blasphemy against the Spirit.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.440]   Here's what he said, just one sentence.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.040]   "It is not a particular species of sin
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.480]   which is here condemned."
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.200]   Like, ooh, I've done that one thing.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.680]   "But," he says, "it is a definite act
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.480]   showing a state of sin,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.480]   and that state a willful, determined opposition
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.760]   to the present power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.240]   And this as shown by its fruit, blasphemy."
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.000]   The declaration in substance
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.640]   of what the New Testament often says.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.640]   So here's the key phrase there.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.640]   It's a state of willful, determined opposition
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.900]   to the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.040]   And then he gives,
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.640]   as one of those other places in the New Testament,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.900]   1 John 5:16, which says,
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.640]   "If anyone sees his brother committing a sin
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.560]   not leading to death, he should ask,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.680]   and God will give him life."
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.160]   To those who commit sin,
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.000]   there is sin that does not lead to death,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.320]   but there is sin that leads to death,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.080]   and I do not say that one should pray for that.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.160]   So this is not, there is a sin that leads to death,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.200]   but there is sin.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.320]   That's the way it should be translated.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.320]   There is sinning.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   There is a kind of willful, determined, settled opposition
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.840]   to God and His Spirit.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.360]   So here are my answers to the two questions.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.840]   One, can a true believer
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.200]   whose salvation is eternally secure in Christ
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.740]   still be guilty of blaspheming the Holy Spirit?
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.360]   No, because I think the meaning
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.440]   of the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.000]   as Alford says, is a willful, determined opposition
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.440]   to the present power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.760]   and Christians cannot commit that kind of sin.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.920]   They don't settle in like that
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.920]   with a settled, determined, willful opposition.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.260]   Christians can commit all kinds of sin,
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.000]   but what marks a Christian is
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.400]   they don't settle in long-term.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.720]   They hate it, and they repent from it.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.920]   They feel bad about it.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.680]   They turn to God for fresh forgiveness.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.960]   So no, a Christian cannot commit
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.120]   what Jesus calls blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.760]   Question number two, is blaspheming the Spirit
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.560]   the same as grieving the Spirit?
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.240]   No, they are not the same,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.680]   and you can see the difference in Ephesians 4, 29 to 31,
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.200]   where Paul says, "Let no corrupting talk
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.760]   "come out of your mouths,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.040]   "but only such as is good for building up
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.680]   "as fits the occasion,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.160]   "that it may give grace to those who hear."
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.040]   Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.040]   by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.360]   Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.720]   and slander be put away from you with all malice.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.420]   So two things.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.920]   One, when we grieve the Holy Spirit, Paul says,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.060]   we're grieving the one who has sealed us
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.560]   for the day of redemption,
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.720]   which means that in the very same breath
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.240]   of saying you can grieve him,
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.040]   he's saying, "You're secure, you're sealed.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.080]   "He will not break that seal.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.540]   "He has got you and he's keeping you
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.200]   "for the day of redemption."
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.940]   And the other thing to notice is specifically
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.180]   what it is that does grieve him.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.160]   What grieves him is bitterness and wrath
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160]   and anger against other people.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.100]   These are the things that Christians do and regret doing
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.080]   and have to repent of doing and ask forgiveness for doing.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   And that very repentance is the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.960]   in great mercy to awaken the children of God to repentance
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.100]   so that we will make it to the day of redemption.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.840]   - That's so good and deeply reassuring for believers.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.560]   And this is such a common question
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.960]   that we get all the time.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.680]   And if you have a question for Pastor John,
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.140]   please send it in to us via email.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.860]   Keep it concise and to the point.

[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.140]   Well, we are all about delighting in God.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.660]   There is nothing more important in the world.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.500]   But if it's so important for the Christian life
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.200]   and so precious to us individually,
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.580]   why does it seem like our joy in God is so short-lived?
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.140]   If the shelf life of our delight in him seems so short,
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.660]   what can we do to preserve it?
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.740]   That's the question on the table tomorrow.
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.620]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.660]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.780]   with longtime pastor and author, John Piper.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.940]   We'll see you tomorrow.
