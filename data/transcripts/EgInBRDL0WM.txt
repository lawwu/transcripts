[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   I should like to call your attention this evening to two of the verses that were read
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.440]   to us in the reading of the scripture by the pastor, namely in the Gospel according to
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:23.720]   Saint Matthew, in chapter 7, reading again verses 13 and 14. Verses 13 and 14 in the
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:32.320]   7th chapter of the Gospel according to Saint Matthew. "Enter ye in at the straight gate,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.040]   for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.640]   be which go in thereat, because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:55.640]   unto life, and few there be that find it." Now there is no charge perhaps that is brought
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.840]   more frequently against the Christian faith, the Christian way of life, and indeed against
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.880]   the individual Christian believer, than the charge of narrowness. It is suggested that
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.840]   because we are Christians, we are therefore of necessity narrow and narrow-minded. And
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.280]   this is especially the favorite charge that is brought against us by that type of man
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.920]   who in his anxiety to demonstrate the breadth and the width of his own view, generally describes
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.120]   himself as being a man of the world. You see, he would never see how wide and broad his
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.200]   views are. Indeed, they are so wide and so broad that nothing less than a world dimension
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.240]   is adequate to measure him. And so he calls himself a man of the world, in contradistinction
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.680]   to this narrow, cramped, confined little person who calls himself a Christian. I think you
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.960]   will agree with me that there is no charge concerning which the average Christian is
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.800]   quite so nervous and of which he is quite so frightened as this particular charge. Indeed,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.400]   there are many Christian people, it seems to me, who are more or less prepared for people
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.720]   to say anything they like about them as long as they never suggest that they are narrow.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.240]   They don't object to people saying that they are wrong or mistaken. Anything but this charge
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.160]   of narrowness. Christian people seem to be unusually sensitive concerning this particular
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.640]   charge. And there is a sense in which, of course, there is a very right and a very healthy
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.120]   view to take and a very healthy reaction to this particular charge. God forbid that any
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.920]   of us should ever really become narrow. I mean by that narrow in the sense that the
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.560]   Pharisees and scribes were narrow. These men who reduced the glorious law of God to a mere
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.920]   number of vetoes and prohibitions and restrictions and restraints. God forbid, I say, that we
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.760]   should ever become narrow in the sense that we reduce the glorious gospel of salvation
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.920]   to a mere moral conduct and behavior. But as I see things today, that is not our danger
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.820]   at all. Our danger, rather, it seems to me, is this, that in our fear and horror of this
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.880]   charge of narrowness, that we should go so far to the other extreme as to be so wide
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:46.480]   and so broad and so large as to lose our landmarks altogether and eventually to be quite nondescript.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.920]   I have often felt in recent years that a well-known story in Aesop's fables has a great deal
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.800]   to say to many a modern Christian. I refer to the famous story of the frog and the ox.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.480]   Do you remember it? The story is that one day there was a little frog in a field. And
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.520]   he happened to look up and he saw this great creature standing by his side. And as he looked
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.200]   at him, he began to feel very small, very insignificant. His ox was so big, so broad,
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.720]   so wide, and he was so small and so narrow. And the story goes on to tell us that he not
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.320]   only looked at the ox, but he began to be envious of him. And that in turn led him to
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.480]   feel a desire to be like the ox. So he proceeded to expand himself and to inflate himself.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.560]   He began to puff himself up and he became bigger and bigger and wider and wider and
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.880]   broader and broader. But you remember the end of the story. He puffed himself up to
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.800]   such an extent that eventually he exploded and ceased to be altogether. And unless I'm
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.360]   very mistaken, something similar to that has happened to the so-called faith of many a
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.680]   so-called Christian, particularly in this 20th century. In their desire to be broad
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.400]   and large and wide in their views, what little faith they ever had has long since exploded
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.600]   and ceased to be altogether. But that has been the tendency. And I believe the present
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.720]   state of the Christian church is very largely to be explained in some such terms as that.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:40.600]   The church has been so anxious to please this broad-minded man, the 20th century man, the
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.680]   man of knowledge, the man of learning, and especially, of course, the man of scientific
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.400]   knowledge and learning. And the church has been so anxious to please him and to win him
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.320]   that she's been prepared to take portions out of the scriptures, not to mention others,
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:06.480]   to renounce others and to deny them altogether. She's taken out the miraculous and the supernatural,
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.080]   the virgin birth, the miracles of our Lord, his substitutionary atoning, death, his literal,
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.080]   physical resurrection, the person of the Holy Spirit. They've been prepared to shed all
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   that in order that they might have a message that would please and placate this new authority,
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:34.000]   the modern man, the modern educated man. But in doing all that, of course, the church has
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.120]   departed very far indeed from the pattern and the example set for her by her Lord and
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:49.020]   Master. As I read the New Testament, the Gospels in particular, I do not find the Lord Jesus
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.240]   Christ trimming and clipping and changing his gospel in order to make it suit the people.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.440]   I find rather that he trimmed and clipped and changed the people in order to make them
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:07.160]   fit into his gospel. And we can be certain, my friends, that we shall see no true awakening
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:15.560]   and revival in the church until we return to the royal manner and the royal example.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:23.080]   My commission and that of any other preacher is this. Ye servant of God, your Master proclaim
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.680]   and publish abroad his wonderful name, whether men like it or whether they dislike it. That
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:36.360]   is the commission and that is what we must do. I say that we must therefore beware of
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:43.360]   this danger, lest in our fear of being called narrow and narrow-minded because we are Christians
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.320]   that we should go so far to the other extreme as to cease to have any message of any value
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.720]   at all or anything distinctive about our whole position.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.800]   So I would say in passing this evening to any Christian who may be here who is frightened
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.400]   of this charge of narrowness, I would say this to you. The next time a so-called man
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.080]   of the world charges you with being narrow because you are a Christian, instead of apologizing
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.880]   and trying to explain away what you believe, just stand your ground and look him straight
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.840]   in the eye and say, "Of course I'm narrow." And it would be a very much better thing for
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.480]   you and especially for your wife and children if you became narrow and ceased the burst
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   of a breadth and a largeness which are nothing but an excuse for laxity and looseness.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.240]   Well whatever else might happen, I can safely promise you this, he wouldn't worry you quite
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.200]   so frequently in the future as he's tended to do in the past. But after all, our business
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:55.400]   tonight is this, is to discover why it is that our Lord deliberately chooses to call
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.800]   this way of life of his the narrow way. Now have you ever thought of this? Isn't this
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:08.480]   a strange thing that when the blessed Son of God, our Savior, came to choose a name
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:15.240]   and a designation for his way of life, he deliberately chose this word that tends to
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:22.520]   frighten us so much? With all the vocabulary of the universe at his disposal, he deliberately
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:32.240]   called it a straight gate, a narrow way. Now why did he do this? Isn't it strange that
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:39.080]   what we are afraid of, he gloried him, he exalted him, he deliberately chose it as the
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:46.800]   motto of his kingdom. Now our Lord did this quite deliberately. He never did anything
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:53.160]   haphazardly. He never did anything accidentally. And when he called this way of life a narrow
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:10:01.520]   way, it was because there are certain respects in which this Christian way of life is definitely
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.200]   and specifically narrow. What are they? It's my privilege to call your attention to that
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:14.600]   this evening, and I have a double object in doing so. I do so in order to provide any
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.200]   nervous Christian who may be here tonight with an answer to this so-called man of the
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:26.440]   world. I do so also in the hope that if there is someone present tonight who hitherto has
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:32.840]   rejected this message because you felt that it's narrow, you will see the folly of your
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:40.480]   rejection. And I trust you will go from this service rejoicing in the straight gate and
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:48.040]   the narrow way. Very well. Why did our Lord call this way of life, this teaching of his,
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:55.560]   the narrow way? Would you enter by the straight gate? The first answer, it seems to me, is
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:05.680]   this. This gospel is narrow in the first place in that it deliberately confines even its
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:15.640]   field of consideration to one subject, to one question, and that is the soul of man
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:23.920]   and its relationship to eternal God. The gospel of Jesus Christ is interested in this one
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:32.080]   subject. It narrows itself down to that. Now this, of course, to our modern ears sounds
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:40.360]   very narrow, sounds very strange. We are living in the age of encyclopedias, and we want to
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:45.560]   know just a little bit about many things. So we are surprised at this and we are amazed
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:52.640]   at this, but that is the truth. The Bible is not an encyclopedia. It's a big book containing
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:58.960]   some sixty-six different books, and there are all sorts of things mentioned here. There
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:06.120]   is the story of creation, there is something about geography and geology, there's a great
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:13.160]   deal of history, births, marriages, deaths, wars, many, many things are just dealt with
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:22.040]   in that way in passing. And yet you know this book is not an encyclopedia. The Bible is
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.080]   not a book which tells you a little about many things. The Bible is a book which tells
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:36.280]   you everything about one thing, and that is the soul of man and its relationship to God.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:42.720]   It's a specialist book, and what I'm saying about the book is equally true of the master
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:50.240]   of the book, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Had you ever realized that? Had you ever realized
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:57.360]   that our Lord always kept himself to one subject, one question? He could have talked about anything.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:04.840]   He had great and vast knowledge, but he deliberately confined himself to this one theme of the
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:11.680]   soul of man and its relationship to God, and all the knowledge that he possessed he simply
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:19.120]   used in order to illustrate and to demonstrate the truth of his teaching concerning this
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.760]   one question. Let me give you some examples of what I'm talking about.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:31.720]   One day it's clear that our Lord was out in the country with his followers, and suddenly
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:38.360]   they find themselves looking at a farmer sowing seed into the ground. Well now, it's clear
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:44.480]   that our Lord knew a great deal about agriculture, and he could have given an address on agriculture,
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:50.880]   but he didn't do so. He was not interested in agriculture, qua agriculture. No, no. He
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.120]   looks at that man sowing seed into the ground, and he uses it as an illustration for his
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.400]   one great sermon, and this is how he used it. He said, "You see that farmer sowing
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.240]   seed into the ground? Well, you know," he said, "incidentally, that man's doing
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:13.840]   another thing. He is testing the ground. There's only one type of seed which he's got, but
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:21.520]   there are many types of ground, and you come to a judgment concerning the ground in terms
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:27.320]   of the response of the ground to this one type of seed that this man is sowing into
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:32.640]   it." And he goes on to say that there are four main types of seed, and then he stops
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.840]   and he says, "Do you know what I'm doing in preaching is very similar to what that
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:45.720]   farmer is doing. I'm doing nothing but sowing the seed of the word of life, and as
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:53.280]   I do so, I am testing you. You will be judged," he says, "in eternity by your response,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:00.680]   your reaction to this word that I'm speaking to you. He that hath ears to hear, let him
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:08.160]   hear. Take heed how he hear." You see, he uses his knowledge of agriculture in order
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.080]   to bring out this one theme of his of the importance of men's soul in its relationship
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:20.160]   to God. Then another time he's out in the country, and this time, obviously, standing
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:26.360]   opposite an orchard. There are the trees, apple trees, pear trees, various trees bearing
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:32.200]   fruit. Now, that again doesn't lead our Lord to give an address on horticulture, though
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.440]   he might have done so. No, no, he's just got another illustration for the same point.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.560]   He says, "Look at those trees. They bear fruit, but fruit can be good or bad, and you
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.360]   judge the fruit of the tree according to the fruit which it bears. Do you know good people,"
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:55.200]   he said, "you are like those trees in that orchard, and you bear fruit, and in eternity
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:02.800]   you will be judged by the fruit that he bear. By their fruits, ye shall know them." Exactly
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:09.920]   the same point. The soul of men face to face with God and its eternal destiny.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.040]   And then another day, they're in the country, and he sees the birds of the air, and the
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.240]   lilies, the flowers of the field. But he doesn't go home to take up a paintbrush and paint
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:25.240]   lilies or to write a poem about birds. No, no, our Lord wasn't interested in art for
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:31.720]   art's sake. He just sees the same point again. He says, "If God so clothes the lily, if
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   God is so interested in the birds of the air, how much greater is his interest in you, you
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:46.600]   everlasting and immortal souls." Whatever he knew, he uses simply to illustrate his
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:52.240]   one theme. Our Lord, in a sense, never lectured, never talked about politics, never talked
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:59.480]   about social questions. He was always preaching on this one theme, the soul of men in its
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:07.800]   relationship to God. So you see, the gospel becomes narrow, even as it considers the one
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   question which is essential. It narrows down even the field of its considerations. But
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:21.320]   I must hasten to say that he even narrowed that down. Our Lord never spoke about the
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:31.040]   soul merely as an idea. He always spoke about the individual soul, the personal soul, your
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:37.680]   soul, my soul. And this is the most important point. The great Greek philosophers who had
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.600]   been in this world and had taught before the Lord Jesus Christ ever came into it, they
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:49.800]   talked a great deal about the soul. These philosophers, they speculated about the soul.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:55.000]   And they'd argue and debate with one another, and they bended about their wonderful terms,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.680]   the soul, as an idea. Our Lord never did that. He was always interested in the personal soul.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.520]   And it's at this point that many a modern man objects to this gospel. He said, "All
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.080]   right, I'm interested in the soul, but when you're going to be personal, I'm no longer
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.680]   interested." You know, there was a Prime Minister in Great Britain at the time of the
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:23.880]   birth of Queen Victoria, at the time that Queen Victoria came to the throne in 1837.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.000]   He put this position once quite perfectly. He was a man called Lord Melbourne. He was
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.440]   a nominal church member, thought he was a Christian, but on one occasion he put it like
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:40.520]   this. He said, "Things are coming to a pretty pass if religion's going to stop being personal."
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.400]   You see, religion is all right. When there was a coronation or the death of a monarch
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:51.800]   or some special baptism or something like that, all right on great state occasions,
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:57.000]   but not personal. This is insufferable. This is narrow. It mustn't become personal and
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:05.360]   individual. And so he objected it like many do today. And yet, whether we like it or not,
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:11.880]   this gospel is intensely personal. And our Lord was always interested in the individual
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.600]   and not in the mere idea of the soul as a concept. Let me give you one proof of what
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:23.120]   I'm saying. It's to be found in a well-known story recorded in the fourth chapter of the
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:29.320]   gospel according to St. John. It's the story of our Lord's meeting with the so-called
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:35.680]   woman of Samaria. You remember it. We are told that one day our Lord was so tired and
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.360]   weary that instead of going with the disciples to the neighboring town to buy provisions,
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:46.160]   he sat down by the side of the well. And as soon as he'd done so, here comes the woman
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:52.680]   of Samaria to draw water from the well. And immediately they began to talk. And of course,
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.920]   immediately they began to have a discussion about religion. The question was, who did
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.320]   this well belong to? Was it to the Jews or to the Samaritans? Another question, where
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.840]   should you worship? The Samaritans said you should worship in this mountain. The Jews
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.640]   said you should worship in Jerusalem. Who did this well belong to? And so on and so
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:19.680]   forth. Now it's clear from the story that this woman was a very intelligent woman. And
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.960]   she was a very able woman and a very good debater. And she liked having a discussion
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.240]   about religion. And she was pert and quick in her answers and in her questions. And she
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:36.000]   was really doing very well until our Lord suddenly did something that no modern gentleman
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.080]   would ever dream of doing. He became personal. Suddenly in the midst of this discussion about
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:50.360]   religion, our Lord looked at the woman and said, "Woman, go fetch thy husband and come
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:57.960]   hither." And the woman said, "Sir, I have no husband." And our Lord said, "In that
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:03.360]   thou saidst, 'I have no husband,' thou speakest the truth. For thou hast had five
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:11.720]   husbands, and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband, in that thou saidst truly."
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.120]   In other words, our Lord revealed to this woman that he knew all about her immoral life
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:24.400]   and living. And what he was really saying was this, "My dear good woman, you are talking
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:31.160]   glibly about God and heaven and hell and judgment and worship. And in the meantime, you're
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:36.160]   living in adultery. You have no right to speak. You have no right to express your opinions.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:41.160]   Put yourself right first, then you can begin to speak." In other words, he brought it
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:49.760]   down to the personal issue. And he did that always and invariably. His point was this,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:55.640]   you see, that when we have to stand before God, God will not be interested in your opinions
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:01.040]   and mine about himself and about worship and about the color question and about politics
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:06.720]   and a thousand and one other things. He'll be interested in one thing only. What have
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:13.000]   you done with the soul that he's given you? This great and wonderful possession, this
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.120]   mark of himself that he's put in us, what have we done with this? It's the one thing
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:26.920]   that matters, the personal soul, the individual soul. And so, you see, he talks about a straight
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:34.880]   gate and a narrow way, not these broad opinions about science and all that we talk about so
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.640]   cleverly and so glibly and the clever men on the television do the same. No, no. The
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   question is, what are they doing with themselves? How are they living? How are they standing
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:50.360]   up to life? How are they honoring God? You see, this is a straight gate. It's a narrow
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:57.200]   gate. Indeed, I think that the gate our Lord is talking about is a turnstile. You know
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.960]   the characteristic of a turnstile? It only takes one person at a time. And there you
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.840]   are alone in the turnstile. You can't take your family with you into the turnstile. It's
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:14.640]   just you, yourself. And this straight gate, I think, was a turnstile. What our Lord was
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.800]   saying was this. You can't be saved in countries. There's no such thing as a Christian country
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.400]   and a pagan country. You can't be saved in families. You may have had the most saintly
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.800]   father or mother the world has ever known. It doesn't save you. God will not deal with
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:37.320]   agents. He wants you and he wants you alone and he has you in this turnstile. And there
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:43.280]   is a point in the life of every man and woman when you're alone, just yourself and God in
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:50.520]   this turnstile, this straight gate, this gate of conviction, of sin that leads inevitably
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:57.040]   to conversion. Now, this is the thing that our Lord is teaching us here. The eyes of
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:03.800]   the fool, says the Old Testament, are on the ends of the earth. And people think that religion
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:09.400]   is about politics and social questions and a thousand and one other things. It isn't.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:17.640]   It is primarily your personal position, face to face with God. And he tells you to stop
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:23.520]   arguing and expressing your learned opinions and just to examine yourself under the eye
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:33.240]   of Almighty God. It's a personal religion. It narrows it down to the individual face
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:39.280]   to face with God. And then, of course, having done that, it goes on to show that it's still
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:47.720]   narrow than that. It now tells us that it insists upon dictating as to how we live.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:53.040]   That's the theme of this sermon on the mount out of which my text tonight is taken. How
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:25:01.200]   to live as children of God. And this is divided, of course, into a negative aspect and a positive
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:08.120]   aspect. The negative aspect you're quite familiar with. It's been summed up once and forever
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:15.160]   in the Ten Commandments, of which this sermon is in a sense an exposition. Thou shalt not
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:21.560]   kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not commit adultery, and so on and so forth. Ah,
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:27.880]   yes, says many a modern man, that's just it. And that's why I'm not a Christian. I can't
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.520]   stand this dictation as to how I'm to live. It's all right, I agree with what you've been
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:38.920]   saying about the soul and the individual responsibility, but I can't stand this narrowness which tells
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.200]   me I mustn't do this, I mustn't do that, and then I must do things that I don't want to
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:50.640]   do. It's too narrow. What do we say to such a man? Well, all I've got to say is this.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:59.080]   You're quite right, my friend. This gospel is very narrow. But had you realized this,
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:05.240]   if only everybody in this world tonight were as narrow as this gospel would have us be,
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:11.920]   you young men would not be fighting in Vietnam. There'd be no more war. There'd be no war
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:18.160]   anywhere. There'd be no drunkenness, there'd be no drug taking, there'd be no color question,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:24.080]   there'd be no infidelity and divorce, there'd be no immorality and vice. If only everybody
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:31.020]   were as narrow as this gospel would have us be, the world would be paradise. For the narrowness
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:39.120]   of this way is the narrowness of God himself, of whom we are told that he cannot be tempted,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:46.320]   neither does he tempt anyone else. God cannot sin, hemmed in by his own eternal holiness.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:52.000]   That's the narrowness of this gospel. And the tragedy of the world tonight is this,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.920]   that the world resents this narrowness that would produce paradise and bursts of a breadth
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:07.520]   and a largeness which lead to nothing but the chaos that is so obvious in our modern
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:14.200]   world at this very moment. It insists upon our walking along the narrow way, but that's
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:21.320]   the negative. It then turns to the positive. We can be narrow in a positive sense, and
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:27.520]   that is very especially the theme of this particular sermon on the mount. What does
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:34.800]   this mean? Well, I like to think of it like this. The gospel wants us to be narrow in
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:41.440]   the sense that the higher up you go in any circle, the fewer the people you'll find
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.880]   in it. Did you notice how he puts it? "Enter ye in at the straight gate, for wide is the
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.920]   gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:57.520]   there, because straight is the gate, narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:06.240]   there be that find it." This is the narrowness of circles. You know what I mean by that.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:12.320]   The higher up you go in any circle, the fewer the people you'll find in it. Take a social
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:19.120]   circle. The lower the social circle, the larger the number of people that are in it. But the
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:24.600]   higher up you go, the fewer the people. There are not as many people in the circle in which
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.440]   the President of the United States turns as there are in the circle that the ordinary
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:36.400]   man turns in. It's the same in every other social circle. It's the same exactly in every
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:42.320]   professional circle. There are many men who can do things remarkably well, but the real
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:49.760]   experts are few in number. There are many people who can paint very well. There are
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:56.680]   very few academicians. There are people who can write some kind of poetry very well. There
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:03.200]   are very few Shakespeareans. And so on, with all talent, all ability, the higher the circle
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:08.320]   of achievement, the fewer the number of people you'll find in it. It's invariable. That's
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:15.760]   what our Lord's talking about. He says, "Don't be content with living your life anyhow. Somehow,
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:22.160]   along the dull planes of life, as the masses are doing, scale the heights. Climb to the
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.600]   top of the mountain, and here's the summit. Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:35.200]   which is in heaven is perfect. Oh," says our Lord, "come up to the narrowest circle on
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:42.400]   the top of the mount, and dwell with God, and live with God." Now that's the narrowness
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:48.520]   of which our Lord is speaking. But men and women are blind to this. They talk about breadth
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:55.600]   and largeness, which is, as I say, nothing but an excuse for laxity and looseness and
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:03.240]   zeal. But, and for me not to keep you unduly, although, my friends, I could keep you to
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:08.520]   midnight on this theme, and I'm afraid I see very little hope for your country or mine
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:14.800]   until people begin to develop a hunger and a thirst for such a glorious gospel, and want
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.920]   to hear more and more about it instead of less and less. But I must take you one further
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:30.560]   step. This gospel becomes yet narrower, and here is its narrowest and its extremest point.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:38.720]   Having said all I've said, the gospel goes on to say this, that salvation is possible
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:46.320]   only in and through one person. "That's it," says the modern man. "That's what I said.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.760]   It's narrow. You're only interested in one person. I'm interested in many. I read about
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.920]   Confucius, Buddha, Mohammed. I've got a broad mind. But you Christians, you narrow yourselves
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:05.080]   down to one person." Well, it's the truth. We do. But it's even narrower than that. This
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:11.840]   gospel says not only that salvation is only possible in one person, it says it is only
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:18.440]   possible through that one person's death. "I determine not to know anything among you
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:27.480]   save Jesus Christ and him crucified." Now, here's the straightest point of all. That
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   salvation is only possible to us as we believe that we are saved by the death of the Son
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:39.840]   of God and the cross on Calvary's hill. "It's impossible," says the modern man. "It's immoral.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:46.400]   This idea that one dies for another, I can't accept it. It's too narrow. I can't go through."
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:53.080]   What does the gospel say to such a man? Well, as I understand it, it says this, "My good
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:32:02.160]   friend, if you can find God and get to know him without going via the cross on Calvary's
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:11.120]   hill, carry on. If you can live life successfully without drawing any power from that cross,
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:17.960]   well, I congratulate you, for I cannot. If you can lie on your deathbed without a quiver
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:24.160]   or a fear or a terror of eternity and the last judgment without leaning your whole weight
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:35.240]   upon that amazing death and that amazing cross, carry on. But if ever you should realize that
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:42.440]   you're a miserable failure, if ever you realize that all your righteousness is but a filthy
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:49.600]   rag, if ever you find yourself trembling on the brink of your own grave, knowing you're
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.360]   going out of life to meet God in the judgment and knowing that you've got nothing to recommend
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:59.960]   yourself and that you're not a condemned sinner, if you feel hopeless and helpless,
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:09.920]   turn back to him, the Christ of the cross, the Christ of Calvary. And thank God you'll
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.320]   find him still there waiting for you and saying, "Look unto me and be ye saved. All the ends
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:24.200]   of the earth, him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out." The gospel doesn't
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   argue with challenges. This is its challenge. But if you can meet God without the cross,
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:37.720]   go on. But when you come to your senses and realize that you cannot and turn back to him
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:43.920]   and what he's done once and forever, he will not refuse you nor reject you, though you
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:50.080]   may have made of him the last resort of a desperate sinner, he will still receive you
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:56.200]   unto himself and grant you his eternal and his glorious salvation.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:02.800]   Now that's the message. Straight is the gate, narrow is the way, but it leadeth unto life.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.280]   I wonder whether you've ever noticed this. Let me put it before you as I close. Have
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:13.880]   you ever noticed, I wonder, how this message of mine tonight, this text in which I'm preaching
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:22.680]   is perfectly illustrated by the earthly story of the Lord Jesus Christ himself. Let me show
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:28.360]   it to you very hurriedly. Straight is the gate, narrow is the way, but it leadeth unto
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:37.160]   life. Straight is the gate. Look at his incarnation. Look at his coming into this world. Do you
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:44.760]   realize what happened? Who is he? Well, he's very God of very God. He's the Word of God
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:52.440]   that was in the beginning. He is the fullness and the effulgence and the brightness of God's
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:35:00.680]   glory. He's infinite. He's absolute. He's eternal. And yet he was born as a helpless
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:08.520]   babe in Bethlehem. Can you imagine any greater straightening than that? Any greater narrowing
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:15.000]   down? He had to divest himself of the insignia of his eternal glory to be born as a helpless
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.800]   babe. Straight is the gate, the gate of Bethlehem, the narrowest gate that the world has ever
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:29.480]   known. But follow his story. Here he is at the age of 30, setting out in his earthly
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:36.360]   ministry. But keep your eye on the Pharisees and scribes and the Sadducees, the doctors
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:41.400]   of the law, the self-righteous people who thought they could save themselves. Watch
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:47.160]   them spreading a net around him, gradually drawing it in. Straight is the gate, narrow
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.120]   is the way. They narrow him down. They bring their trick clever questions. They try to
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:57.960]   trip him and to catch him. They're narrowing him down. And eventually they narrowed him
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:05.040]   down to just one garden, the garden of Gethsemane. Here he is, the one through whom all things
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:11.000]   have been created, the one who sustains all things by the word of his power. He's confined
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.920]   to just a garden. They've got soldiers right around it. They're narrowing him down. Straight
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:24.680]   is the gate, narrow is the way. In a few hours, look at him, he's in a police court on trial.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.960]   Soldier stands on one hand, soldier on the other. He was allowed to walk up and down
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.920]   the garden. He's not allowed to walk now. They're narrowing him down. They've fixed
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:42.800]   him, fixed to the court, the trial. But wait a minute. Look again at him. They've condemned
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:49.360]   him. And now they've literally nailed him to a tree. In the court, he could at the end
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:55.320]   of it move his hands and his legs and feet. He can do so no longer. They've nailed him.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.080]   They've fixed him to the tree, the son of God, the creator of the universe. He can't
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:07.080]   move, nor hand nor foot. They've narrowed him down to this immobility of the cross.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:13.240]   Straight is the gate and narrow is the way. But wait a minute. He dies. They take down
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.800]   his body and they put it into a grave. Look into that grave for a moment. Can you see
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.080]   anything there? Don't you see the very sides collapsing? It's death. It's the end. It's
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   the grave. There's nothing possible beyond it. It's the end of all. No, no, wait a minute.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:41.080]   Straight is the gate, narrow is the way. But it leadeth unto life. And so it did. Bethlehem,
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:52.080]   youth, public ministry, opposition of enemies, trial, agony of Gethsemane, condemnation,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:38:04.080]   death, burial, grave. But the morning of the third day, he burst asunder the bends of death.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:10.080]   He arose triumphant, o'er the grave bringing life and immortality to light through his
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:20.080]   gospel. There it is. Straight is the gate, narrow is the way. But it leadeth unto life,
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   which is life indeed and life eternal. My dear friend, the one thing that matters for
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:33.080]   every one of us here tonight and for everybody in the universe is just this. Which of these
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:42.080]   two ways are we on? The masses, the majority, are on the broad way. Look at it this way.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:48.080]   Look at this wide gate. Look at this broad way. And look at the crowd that's going in.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:55.080]   Many there be that go in there at. And so it is, you see. Why? Well, because it doesn't
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:01.080]   take a genius to go wrong. It doesn't take a genius to become a drunkard or a drug addict
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:07.080]   or someone who lives according to the dictates of the pleasure mania. Any fool can do it.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:13.080]   Every fool is doing it. The world is going that way. Many there be that go in there at.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:19.080]   But you know, the important thing to ask about a road is not so much whether it's wide or
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   narrow. The one question that's important is this. Where does it lead to? And here's the
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:34.080]   answer. Wide is the gate, broad is the way, and the lights are shining and the music is
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   going on and the band's playing. It's all so marvelous. Where does it lead? But it leadeth
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:51.080]   to destruction, to hopelessness, to despair. Wonderful at the beginning, blind and dark
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   and doomed at the end, and a fearfulness beyond which baffles description. Everlasting death
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   outside the life of the blessed God. Wide is the gate and broad is the way, but it leadeth
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:17.080]   to destruction. Have you realized that, my friend? The other way, I admit, it appears
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:24.080]   to be so narrow in contradistinction. So narrow, so straight, so confined, seems to take everything
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:29.080]   from you and to leave you with nothing. Look at it again. Look at the people who are on
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:36.080]   it. Ask where it leads to. And here is this glorious and eternal difference. Straight
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:43.080]   is the gate, narrow is the way. It seems to refuse many things to you in the here and
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:49.080]   now, but go on, follow Him, and it'll get wider and broader and more glorious and more
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:55.080]   illuminated, and it'll lead you to the light of a perfect day. It'll lead to life which
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:02.080]   is life indeed, the vision of God, and everlasting and eternal glory and bliss.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:12.080]   I say, therefore, once more, nothing matters but this. We're all of us on one of these
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:19.080]   two ways. You can't help that. If you're not on the narrow way, you're on the broad
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:27.080]   way. Which is it, my friend? Have you examined these things? What of your soul? What of your
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:33.080]   relationship to God? Are you ready to meet Him? Are you ready to face Him? Are you ready
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:43.080]   to face the judgment? There's only one way. To do so without a fear, it is to believe
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:51.080]   and to accept this invitation of the blessed Son of God Himself, who came down into this
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:58.080]   world through the straight gate of Bethlehem to live, to die, and to rise again, to save
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:05.080]   us and to redeem us. And He invites you tonight, unless you've ever done so before, to enter
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:14.080]   in at this straight gate, which means acknowledgement and confession of sins, repentance, and a
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:21.080]   giving of yourself to Him and a determination to follow Him by His grace, until you come
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   to one of those many mentions which He has gone ahead to prepare for you in heaven and
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:35.080]   with God. If you've never done so before, enter in tonight at the straight gate. Come
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   unto the narrow way, which leadeth unto life, which is life indeed. Let us pray.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:57.080]   O Lord, our God, how can we thank Thee sufficiently for the glory of Thy gospel? O God, we bless
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:05.080]   Thee, that when we were yet in darkness, Thou didst illumine the blackness and darkness
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:12.080]   of our minds and hearts. Thou hast come to call us out of darkness into Thy marvelous
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:20.080]   light. O God, open the eyes of all who still are blinded by the God of this world and talk
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:27.080]   of a breadth and a largeness and a way which but lead to destruction. God, have mercy upon
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:33.080]   them. Grant them this illumination by Thy Spirit that will make them see the error and
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:41.080]   folly of their ways and the glory of the straight gate and the narrow way, which lead unto life,
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:50.080]   life more abundant, life eternal in Thy dear Son. Hear us, O Lord. Bless Thy word wherever
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   it has been faithfully preached this day. Extend Thy glorious kingdom. Win glory and
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:04.080]   honor to Thy great and holy name. Hear us, O Lord, as we come in the name of Thy dear
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   Son, our blessed Lord and Savior. And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   the love of God, the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:25.080]   us now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain, earthly
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:32.080]   life and pilgrimage and evermore. Amen.
