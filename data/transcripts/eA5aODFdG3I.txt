[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   This episode will launch on the evening of the 4th of July, so many Americans will be
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.380]   sleep deprived tonight, which is very timely because we have an email from a listener named
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.780]   Ashley who writes in to ask, "How much sleep is a sign of personal laziness and how little
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.080]   sleep is a sign of faithless arrogance?"
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.440]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.880]   My question for you is about sleep.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.040]   I've heard opposing opinions ranging from some saying that sleep is a very necessary
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.840]   and humbling reminder of our mortality, to others explaining that we must sacrifice everything
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.280]   including sleep to be able to utilize our time on earth to glorify God.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.620]   What are your thoughts on this?
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.760]   Is it more glorifying to God to utilize His gift of rest through sleep or to capitalize
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.560]   on the time we have to go sleep deprived in order to more fully serve Him?
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.320]   Pastor John, what would you say to Ashley?
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.600]   I wonder if it might be helpful to compare this question to the question about food and
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.160]   fasting.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.120]   Is food good?
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.900]   Should it be enjoyed?
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.000]   Should we regularly eat a healthy diet?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.120]   But on the other hand, is fasting good?
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.200]   Not eating.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.120]   Are there times when for the kingdom we will skip meals?
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.400]   And the answer is surely that God does give food as an absolute necessity for life.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.960]   You can't live without food, and you can't live without sleep.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.120]   And He does approve of our enjoyment of the food.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:52.400]   First Timothy 6.17, First Timothy 4.4, "And He commends the goodness of rest to His disciples.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.560]   Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while."
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.760]   Mark 6.31.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.720]   So both are surely true.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.680]   Sleep is good.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.360]   Sleep is humbling.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.580]   Sleep is a parable of our helplessness and of our utter dependence on God.
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.280]   Sleep is a gift.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.880]   But sleep is not the absolute good.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.480]   And in a world with desperate need on every hand, the aim is not to maximize our comfort
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.640]   in this life or even our health in this life, but to love people and do as much good as
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.720]   we can.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.680]   We see this played out in Jesus' life and His teaching.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.080]   Rising very early in the morning while it was still dark, He departed and went out to
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.280]   a desolate place, and there He prayed.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.280]   Mark 1.35.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.080]   So He got up early in the morning.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:03.800]   That means He did not sleep out or sleep in, like we might say.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:12.240]   Or Luke 6.12, "In these days He went out to the mountain to pray, and all night He
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.920]   continued in prayer to God."
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.640]   Now, I don't know what He did about sleep that night, but when ordinary sleep was called
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.120]   for, He skipped it for kingdom reasons.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.280]   And yet Jesus had such peace with God and composure in this world that He fell asleep
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.280]   in a boat during a storm and could sleep right through the storm, Luke 8.23.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.160]   So it seems that if Jesus did lose sleep in one part of the day, He would catch up in
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.880]   other parts with sleeps in storms.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:57.520]   He describes—this is interesting—He describes the work of the kingdom like this.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.320]   The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:10.480]   He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.800]   He knows not how.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.280]   Now, what's the point?
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.920]   God is the decisive worker.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.560]   That's the point.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.640]   God is the decisive seed-sprouter and grower of fruit, and the advance of the kingdom is
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.880]   not finally dependent on us.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.820]   God uses us, to be sure, but not in such a way that we should feel indispensable to His
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.820]   purposes.
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.240]   He can do it, thank you very much, without us, and so it should relieve us of a God complex
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.040]   or a Messiah complex.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.760]   Take Paul, for example.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.920]   He knew that.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.560]   He knew that God was decisive.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   Nevertheless, there were numerous situations in Paul's life where he had to forego sleep
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.360]   for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.080]   Second Corinthians 6, 4, and 5, servants of God, as servants of God, we commend ourselves
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.360]   in every way by great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments,
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.360]   riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.640]   Or again, Second Corinthians 11, 25, "Three times I was beaten with rods.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.640]   Once I was stoned.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   Three times I was shipwrecked.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.800]   A night and day I was adrift at sea, in toil and hardship, through many sleepless nights,
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.400]   in hunger and thirst."
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.760]   So Paul didn't quit the ministry because it was exhausting.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.000]   He found a way to press on.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.480]   And then, of course, lastly, there's the wonderful Psalm 127, 1 and 2, where God again is the
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.720]   decisive worker in all our work.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.720]   Here's what it says.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.200]   "Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build labor in vain.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.600]   Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain."
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:15.440]   And here it comes, "It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.960]   the bread of anxious toil, for he gives to his beloved sleep."
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.400]   You can build a house, you can watch over a city, and you can skip sleep, and all of
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:35.520]   it will be in vain, unless the Lord builds the house, the Lord watches over the city,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.600]   and the Lord keeps you up by his call and his strength for his purpose.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:50.920]   So the question always will be, "Am I getting less sleep because I am truly being led by
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:07:00.720]   the Lord and sustained by the Lord in humble faith, or am I presumptuously jumping off
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.040]   the temple and testing the Lord to see if he'll catch me and keep me from getting a
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.040]   heart attack?"
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.040]   So good.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.160]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.520]   And God can do more in five minutes than we can do in a sleep-deprived day.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.280]   So it's never just about the sleep, it's about the God who is at work in and through us according
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   to his sovereign plan.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.280]   This is so good.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.680]   This episode reminds me of episode 143 in the podcast, where we looked at the phrase
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.080]   that we sometimes hear tossed around, "Work like an Arminian and sleep like a Calvinist."
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.320]   You can check out that episode, number 143.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:43.400]   You can find that in the archive of now almost 1,100 episodes on our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.480]   And as you can hear, we're still working through some of those audio issues on Pastor John's
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.160]   end, so thank you for your patience as we try to figure this out.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.600]   And we're going to close out the week looking at what does it mean to dream big things for
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.920]   God, having ambitious plans and serving God, and how do we guard ourselves against those
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.560]   plans really just being an exhibition of our own self-image?
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.640]   Should I dream big for God if I have a big ego?
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.600]   That's a good question, and we'll talk about it on Friday.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   We'll see you then.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.100]   [ends]
