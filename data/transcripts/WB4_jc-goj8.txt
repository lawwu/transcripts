[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   - Well, you can pop the streamers and drop some confetti
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.920]   because today Pastor John is episode number 900
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.080]   in the podcast series.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.560]   And of course it also means that we have taken up
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.540]   900 various themes in this podcast.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.600]   And of course we haven't done it alone.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.920]   We've relied on a bunch of really great and gifted guests
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.000]   over the years to help pull this off.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.120]   And in the course of producing this podcast
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.000]   day in and day out, it is not uncommon,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800]   especially in social media and places like Facebook
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.120]   to read occasional comments from people who claim
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.800]   that this podcast and what we do,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.320]   we're sort of overthinking the Christian life.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.940]   So that's the question for you today
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.920]   here in episode number 900.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.960]   And so I'm daring to create
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.960]   a potentially ironic episode here,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.080]   but the question for you today is this,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.000]   can we overthink the Christian life?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.880]   And isn't life more about embracing the moment
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.480]   rather than thinking through every life situation?
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.000]   And what would you say are some biblical reasons,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.560]   some validations for why it's important for Christians
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.340]   to think carefully about various levels
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.280]   of ethical situations like the ones
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.480]   that we address here on the podcast?
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.480]   - I have three responses to that question.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.080]   Two of them I think are basically affirmations
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.400]   of the concern that's being expressed.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.600]   And the other one, perhaps more critical,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.880]   a little pushback, caution.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.720]   So first, I would say, yes,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.440]   it is possible to overthink the Christian life.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.000]   And I can think of maybe three ways to talk about that
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.520]   where a person might overthink the Christian life.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.160]   And of course the word over, overthink,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.400]   obviously implies something's being done disproportionately.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   And so, yeah, we wanna get our lives in proportion here
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.120]   and not do anything disproportionately.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.280]   So here are those three things
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.760]   that I think would say yes to this criticism.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.840]   One is, even if one of us, I mean,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.880]   even if any of us is thinking too much
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.840]   about the Christian life,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.360]   it might be because he's just thinking poorly
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.040]   or incorrectly or wrong-headedly.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.840]   And the issue is not quantity,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.000]   but that person is just not thinking well,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.400]   not thinking right.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.880]   So clearly there's bad thinking about the Christian life.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.040]   Number two, but if I use the word overthinking,
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.360]   not just bad thinking,
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.280]   the first thing that comes to my mind
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.280]   is that it would be overthinking about issues
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.480]   if we think so much that our thinking
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.400]   excludes other important things
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.440]   that we should be doing instead.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.520]   For example, I am overthinking
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.320]   if I'm thinking when I ought to be praying.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.160]   I'm overthinking if I'm thinking
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.560]   when I ought to be trusting.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.400]   I'm overthinking if I'm thinking
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   when I ought to be resting or sleeping
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.640]   or relaxing with my wife or playing with my children
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.120]   or enjoying a poem or singing a song.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.360]   We overdo anything, including thinking,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.360]   if that thing is keeping us from doing something else
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.520]   that we ought to be doing.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.640]   And of course, it's a great challenge in the Christian life
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.960]   to keep our many activities and responsibilities
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.680]   in a healthy proportion.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.000]   So yes, there's such a thing as overthinking,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.640]   namely thinking when you ought to be doing something else
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.200]   besides thinking.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   Number three, another way to think about overthinking
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.080]   in the Christian life is to say,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.280]   I'm overthinking when I'm thinking
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.000]   motivated by fear or driven
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.600]   by some unhealthy controlling compulsion.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.360]   If I feel insecure in my acceptance with God,
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.480]   and I believe that thinking more clearly
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.200]   about the Christian life will make me more acceptable,
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.880]   I'm definitely overthinking.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.600]   I need a good dose of the gospel of grace.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.200]   Or if I find myself,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.520]   and I've known a couple of people like this,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.560]   if I find myself driven in a kind of obsessive,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.800]   compulsive way to meticulously think through
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.960]   every little choice in my life,
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.120]   I'm clearly in the grip of something very unhealthy
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.200]   and I'm overthinking.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   Thinking needs to flow from the heart of a restful reliance
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.800]   upon the mercy of God in Christ
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   so that we are not trying to justify ourselves by thinking,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.880]   but rather in a peaceful outworking of a heart
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.280]   that's fixed on Christ, we're doing what love calls for.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.440]   So at least those three things should be said
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.000]   by way of affirmation.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.640]   Yes, there is wrong thinking and overthinking in those ways.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   My second response is a pushback a little bit
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.880]   because I wanna say to those whose personalities
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.320]   just incline them to be not a thinker at all,
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.880]   but just act spontaneously,
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.800]   I wanna say to those people,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   at least come to terms with the biblical texts like this.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.760]   2 Timothy 2:7, "Think over what I say,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.840]   "for the Lord will give you understanding in everything."
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.600]   So Paul says to think over what he says.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.760]   And 1 Corinthians 14 20,
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.160]   "Brothers, do not be children in your thinking,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.440]   "but be infants in evil,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.520]   "but in your thinking be mature."
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.640]   Now, besides those particular texts,
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.680]   consider that the Bible is a book.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.560]   I mean, and being a book, it requires reading.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.080]   And what is reading?
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.360]   Besides using the mind to construe
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.880]   how words relate to each other
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.600]   and how phrases relate to each other
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.680]   and how clauses relate to each other
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.000]   and propositions relate to each other
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.920]   and paragraphs relate to each other,
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.040]   which is just another way of saying
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.760]   that the fact that the Bible is a book
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.800]   means that God intends for us to think
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.280]   some pretty serious thoughts about his revelation
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.640]   concerning himself and his ways in the world.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.440]   He wouldn't have given us a book
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.520]   if he didn't expect that thinking would be necessary.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.040]   It was a huge moment in my life
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   when I woke up to the fact that the Bible
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.600]   is not just a string of pearls to be admired one at a time
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.240]   or a package of lifesavers to be dissolved
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.960]   on the tongue of my soul one at a time,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.440]   but rather the Bible in its writings,
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.800]   most of them, forges a chain of arguments
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.960]   connected by words like because and therefore
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.600]   and although and in order that,
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.040]   and he expects us to do the reading and the reasoning.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.320]   So for example, flee from sexual immorality.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.840]   Every other sin a person commits is outside the body,
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.520]   but sexually immoral person sins against his own body,
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.040]   or do you not know that your body
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.440]   is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you,
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.800]   which you have from God?
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.760]   You are not your own.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.960]   You were bought with a price,
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.440]   so glorify God in your body.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.320]   Now, those are five arguments
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.280]   for why you shouldn't have sex before marriage.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.440]   One, it's a sin against your own body.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.000]   Two, your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.600]   Three, you're bought with a price.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.520]   Four, therefore you're not your own.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.160]   Five, so glorify God in your body.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.600]   So when the listener who wrote that question says,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.960]   "Isn't life more about embracing the moment
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.780]   "rather than thinking through every life situation?"
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.200]   My answer is that if you embrace
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.520]   the moment of temptation to fornication
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.720]   without having thought with deep conviction
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.120]   about these arguments that God has given us,
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.420]   it may not just be the moment that you embrace.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.480]   Here's my third response,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.560]   and this again is by way of affirmation.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   Most of life not only should be spontaneous,
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.120]   it has to be.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.120]   I mean, we cannot stop every five or 10 seconds
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.620]   and come up with three or four arguments
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.120]   like John Piper does on "Ask Pastor John"
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.080]   for whether the next word coming out of my mouth
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.640]   is gonna be a harsh word or a gentle word.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.920]   My arms and my legs and my facial expressions
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.280]   and the words coming out of my mouth,
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.320]   they flow like a river.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.100]   They don't flow in little chunks
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.500]   with nice thinking in between them.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.980]   Life simply doesn't work that way.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.720]   Life is a spontaneous, reflexive action
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.140]   to what's happening around us.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.760]   Maybe, I don't know, it's probably an exaggeration
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.940]   to say 10% of our life is seriously reflected over
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.580]   in the moment before we do it
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.420]   to try to come up with the ideal behavior
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.260]   that's gonna come.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.260]   So yeah, you'd go insane trying to argue yourself
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.760]   into every next step that you take.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.000]   You'd turn into some kind of impersonal robot
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.280]   and you'd alienate everybody around you
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.800]   by acting in an idiotic way.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.400]   And besides, it's impossible.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.180]   So yes, yes, yes, if you try to turn all of life
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.520]   into an "Ask Pastor John" moment,
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.840]   (laughs)
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.160]   you go insane.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.000]   - Exactly.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.940]   - It's crazy, I would too.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.480]   Goodness, we only do these every week or two.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.680]   (laughs)
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.360]   And record them.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.280]   But here's my argument.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:05.080]   My argument is that regular, periodic, disciplined thinking
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.480]   like John and Tony do every now and then,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.740]   and people do maybe once a day with us,
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.280]   that periodic, disciplined effort to think about an issue
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.220]   is all for the sake of the 90% of life
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.840]   when you're not doing that.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.600]   It's building a structure of biblical thought
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.440]   into your mind.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.240]   It's building structures of right affections
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.600]   into your mind so that when the 90% of your life
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.740]   that has to be lived unreflectingly,
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.240]   that is without any long effort to think through reasons,
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.240]   you will act more spontaneously in accord with God's Word.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.600]   And maybe the last thing I should say
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.400]   is that there are a few people
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.960]   who are given to overthinking life.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   My guess is that 99% of the people in the world,
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.600]   and Christians included, are not guilty of that problem.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.880]   You may have met two or three of them,
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.880]   but far greater concern is that most people are wired
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.520]   for a kind of coasting in life without thinking,
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.440]   and what it produces is not authentic freedom
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.760]   and spontaneity, it produces going with the flow
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.880]   of the culture.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.880]   So Tony and I, Tony and I will press on
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.260]   in our little effort to grow in grace
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.220]   and in thinking clearly about the Christian life.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.880]   Come along if it seems helpful.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.720]   Amen.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.800]   Strategic thoughtfulness leading to godly spontaneity.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.160]   That's great, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.800]   And thanks for listening to the podcast
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.520]   for all of our 900 episodes.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.480]   Many of you listen every day,
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.120]   and I wanna thank you for making us a part
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.060]   of your daily routines, your daily commute.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.960]   This podcast does not happen without you,
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.800]   without your questions, your listenership,
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.200]   and of course your financial support is behind it all.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.680]   And I know many of you who listen
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.400]   also support the work of Desiring God
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.600]   and make it all happen.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.280]   So thank you for partnering with us
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.640]   up to this point of episode number 900.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.640]   And every one of those episodes can be found,
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.360]   of course, at our landing page online
