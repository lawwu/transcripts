[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   And now for something completely different.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.280]   Do you mind doing a bit of a meme review in the spirit of the great, the powerful PewDiePie?
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.560]   Let's say 1 to 11, just go over a few documents printed out.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.280]   We can try.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.160]   Let's try this.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.480]   I present to you document numero uno.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.000]   I don't know.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Okay.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Vlad the Impaler discovers marshmallows.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.680]   That's not bad.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.000]   So you get it because he likes impaling things?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Yes, I get it.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.240]   I don't know, three, whatever.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.760]   That's not very good.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.000]   This is ground in some engineering, some history.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.800]   Yeah, I give this an eight out of 10.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.600]   What do you think about nuclear power?
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.320]   I'm in favor of nuclear power.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.720]   I think it's in a place that is not subject to extreme natural disasters, I think it's
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.400]   a nuclear power is a great way to generate electricity.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.200]   I don't think we should be shutting down nuclear power stations.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.520]   Yeah, but what about Chernobyl?
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.800]   Exactly.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.920]   So I think people, there's like a lot of fear of radiation and stuff.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.160]   And I guess what the problem is like a lot of people just don't understand, they didn't
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.120]   study engineering or physics.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.120]   Just the word radiation just sounds scary, you know, so they can't calibrate what radiation
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.560]   means.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.400]   But radiation is much less dangerous than you'd think.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:09.160]   So like, for example, Fukushima, you know, when the Fukushima problem happened due to
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.280]   the tsunami, I got people in California asking me if they should worry about radiation from
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.080]   Fukushima, I'm like, definitely not, not even slightly, not at all.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.960]   That is crazy.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:34.840]   And just to show like, look, this is how like the dangers is so much overplayed compared
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.880]   to what it really is that I actually flew to Fukushima.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.080]   And actually, I donated a solar power system for a water treatment plant.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:59.240]   And I made a point of eating locally grown vegetables on TV in Fukushima.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.240]   Like I'm still alive, okay.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.720]   So it's not even that the risk of these events is low, but the impact of them is...
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.920]   Impact is greatly exaggerated.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   It's human nature.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.360]   People don't know what radiation is.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.640]   Like I've had people ask me like, what about radiation from cell phones causing brain cancer?
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.680]   I'm like, when you say radiation, do you mean photons or particles?
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.800]   They're like, I don't know what you mean, photons, particles.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.920]   Do you mean, let's say photons, what frequency or wavelength?
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.920]   And they're like, no, I have no idea.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.400]   Like, do you know that everything's radiating all the time?
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   Like what do you mean?
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.440]   Like, yeah, everything's radiating all the time.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.080]   Photons are being emitted by all objects all the time, basically.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:52.240]   And if you want to know what it means to stand in front of nuclear fire, go outside.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.680]   The sun is a gigantic thermonuclear reactor that you're staring right at it.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.240]   Are you still alive?
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   Yes.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   Okay, amazing.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.080]   Yeah, I guess radiation is one of the words that can be used as a tool to fear monger
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.080]   by certain people.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   That's it.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.080]   I think people just don't understand.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.880]   I mean, that's the way to fight that fear, I suppose, is to understand, is to learn.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.840]   Yeah, just say like, okay, how many people have actually died from nuclear accidents?
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.240]   It's like practically nothing.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.920]   And say how many people have died from coal plants?
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.920]   And it's a very big number.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.880]   So like, obviously, we should not be starting up coal plants and shutting down nuclear plants.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.880]   Just doesn't make any sense at all.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.920]   Coal plants like, I don't know, 100 to 1000 times worse for health than nuclear power
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   plants.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.920]   You want to go to the next one?
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.760]   This is really bad.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.880]   So that 90, 180 and 360 degrees, everybody loves the math.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.560]   Nobody gives a shit about 270.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.960]   It's not super funny.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.080]   I don't like 203.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.000]   This is not, you know, LOL situation.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.800]   That was pretty good.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.240]   The United States oscillating between establishing and destroying dictatorships.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   It's like a metric.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   Is that a metric?
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.240]   Yeah, metronome.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.240]   Yeah, it's a 7 out of 10.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   It's kind of true.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.280]   Oh, yeah, this is kind of personal for me.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   Next one.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   Oh, man, this is Laika.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.280]   Well, no, this is...
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.400]   Or it's like referring to Laika or something?
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   As Laika's like, husband.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   Husband.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   Hello.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.920]   Yes, this is dog.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.000]   Your wife was launched into space.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.520]   And then the last one is him with his eyes closed and a bottle of vodka.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.520]   Yeah, Laika didn't come back.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520]   No.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.520]   They don't tell you the full story of, you know, what the impact they had on the loved
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   ones.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.520]   True.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.520]   That one gets an 11 for me.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.520]   I love the Soviet show.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.800]   Oh, yeah, this keeps going on the Russian theme.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.240]   First man in space, nobody cares.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240]   First man on the moon.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   Well, I think people do care.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   I know, but...
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:16.160]   Yuri Gagarin's names will be forever in history, I think.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.560]   There is something special about placing, like, stepping foot onto another totally foreign
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560]   land.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.400]   It's not the journey like people that explore the oceans.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.640]   It's not as important to explore the oceans as to land on a whole new continent.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.440]   This is about you.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.760]   Oh, yeah, I'd love to get your comment on this.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.520]   Elon Musk, after sending $6.6 billion to the UN to end world hunger, you have three hours.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:54.640]   Yeah, well, I mean, obviously $6 billion is not going to end world hunger.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.040]   So I mean, the reality is at this point, the world is producing far more food than it can
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.040]   really consume.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.320]   Like, we don't have a caloric constraint at this point.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:16.240]   So where there is hunger, it is almost always due to like, Civil War, strife or some like...
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:23.880]   It's not a thing that is extremely rare for it to be just a matter of like, lack of money.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.320]   It's like, you know, it's like some Civil War in some country and like one part of the
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.440]   country is literally trying to starve the other part of the country.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.160]   So it's much more complex than something that money could solve.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160]   It's geopolitics.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.240]   It's a lot of things.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.240]   It's human nature.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.240]   It's governments.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.040]   It's money, monetary systems, all that kind of stuff.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.080]   Yeah, food is extremely cheap these days.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:57.920]   I mean, the US at this point, you know, among low-income families, obesity is actually another
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920]   problem.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.560]   It's not like, obesity is not hunger.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.080]   It's like too much, you know, too many calories.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.360]   So it's not that nobody's hungry anywhere.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.720]   It's just, this is not a simple matter of adding money and solving it.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.200]   What do you think that one gets?
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   Just kidding.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   I don't know.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   Two.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.920]   I'm just going after empires.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.960]   World, where did you get those artifacts?
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   The British Museum.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.000]   Shout out to Monty Python.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   We found them.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.240]   Yeah, the British Museum is pretty great.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.840]   I mean, admittedly Britain did take these historical artifacts from all around the world and put
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   them in London.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.540]   But, you know, it's not like people can't go see them.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:54.280]   So it is a convenient place to see these ancient artifacts is London for a large segment of
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.480]   the world.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.520]   So I think, you know, on balance, the British Museum is a net good.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.960]   Although I'm sure a lot of countries would argue about that.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.360]   It's like, you want to make these historical artifacts accessible to as many people as
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.760]   possible.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.920]   And the British Museum, I think, does a good job of that.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.600]   Even if there's a darker aspect to like the history of empire in general, whatever the
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:22.560]   empire is, however things were done, it is the history that happened.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.680]   You can't sort of erase that history, unfortunately.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.080]   You could just become better in the future.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   It's the point.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.480]   I mean, it's like, well, how are we going to pass moral judgment on these things?
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:42.160]   Like it's like, if one is going to judge, say, the British Empire, you've got to judge
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.640]   what everyone was doing at the time and how were the British relative to everyone.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.080]   And I think the British would actually get like a relatively good grade, relatively good
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:10:00.480]   grade, not in absolute terms, but compared to what everyone else was doing, they were
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480]   not the worst.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.840]   Like I said, you got to look at these things in the context of the history at the time
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.640]   and say, what were the alternatives and what are you comparing it against?
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:17.680]   And I do not think it would be the case that Britain would get a bad grade when looking
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.000]   at history at the time.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.320]   Now, if you judge history from what is morally acceptable today, you're basically going to
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.720]   give everyone a failing grade.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.720]   I'm not clear.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:36.000]   I don't think anyone would get a passing grade in their morality of like, you go back 300
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.400]   years ago, like who's getting a passing grade?
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.200]   Basically no one.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:47.960]   And we might not get a passing grade from generations that come after us.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   What does that one get?
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.960]   Sure, six, seven.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   For the Monty Python, maybe.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   I always love Monty Python, they're great.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:59.640]   The Life of Brian and the Quest of the Holy Grail are incredible.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.640]   Damn, those serious eyebrows.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:07.880]   How important do you think is facial hair to great leadership?
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.320]   You got a new haircut, how does that affect your leadership?
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.280]   I don't know, hopefully not.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.280]   It doesn't.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.280]   Is that the second no one?
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.280]   Yeah, the second is no one.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.240]   There is no one competing with Brejnev.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.800]   Those are like epic eyebrows.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   Sure.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   That's ridiculous.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.600]   Give it a six or seven, I don't know.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.640]   I like this Shakespearean analysis of memes.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.880]   Brejnev, he had a flair for drama as well.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.880]   Like showmanship.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.280]   It must come from the eyebrows.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.520]   All right, invention.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.520]   Great engineering.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.520]   Look what I invented.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.160]   That's the best thing since ripped up bread.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.280]   Because they invented sliced bread.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.400]   Am I just explaining memes at this point?
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   This is what my life has become.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   He's a meme lord, he's a meme explainer.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:14.600]   I'm a meme, like a scribe that runs around with the kings and just writes down memes.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.680]   I mean, when was a cheeseburger invented?
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   That's like an epic invention.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680]   Like, wow.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680]   Versus just like a burger?
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:27.920]   Or a burger, I guess a burger in general.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.360]   Then there's like, what is a burger?
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   What's a sandwich?
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.360]   And then you start getting, is a pizza a sandwich?
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.600]   And what is the original?
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.160]   It gets into an ontology argument.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.880]   Yeah, but everybody knows if you order a burger or cheeseburger or whatever, and you get tomato
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.040]   and some lettuce and onions and whatever, and mayo and ketchup and mustard, it's like
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.040]   epic.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.680]   Yeah, but I'm sure they've had bread and meat separately for a long time and it was
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:56.120]   kind of a burger on the same plate, but somebody who actually combined them into the same thing
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.440]   and bite it and hold it makes it convenient.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.000]   It's a materials problem.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Your hands don't get dirty and whatever.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Yeah, it's brilliant.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.680]   That is not what I would have guessed.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.200]   But everyone knows if you order a cheeseburger, you know what you're getting.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.440]   It's not like some obtuse, like, I wonder what I'll get.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.440]   Fries are great.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.720]   I mean, they're the devil, but fries are awesome.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.680]   And yeah, pizza is incredible.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.480]   Food innovation doesn't get enough love, I guess is what we're getting at.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.480]   Great.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.720]   What about the Matthew McConaughey, Austinite here.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.760]   President Kennedy, do you know how to put men on the moon yet?
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.760]   And ask him no.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.080]   President Kennedy, it'd be a lot cooler if you did.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.360]   Pretty much, sure.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.840]   Six six or seven, I suppose.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.440]   And this is the last one.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.320]   That's funny.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.920]   Someone drew a bunch of dicks all over the walls of Sistine Chapel, boys bathroom.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.960]   Sure, I'll give it a nine.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.120]   It's really true.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.280]   This is our highest ranking meme for today.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   I mean, it's true.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.280]   Like, how do they get away with it?
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.280]   Lots of nakedness.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.040]   I mean, dick pics are, I mean, just something throughout history.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.080]   As long as people can draw things, there's been a dick pic.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.480]   It's a staple of human history.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   It's a staple.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.360]   Consistent throughout human history.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
