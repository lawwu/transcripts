[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.280]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.760]   My guest today is Dr. Alan Shore.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.760]   Dr. Alan Shore is a clinician psychoanalyst,
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.520]   and he is the world expert
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.360]   in how childhood attachment patterns
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.880]   impact our adult relationships,
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.840]   including romantic relationships,
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.440]   friendships, and professional relationships,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.200]   as well as our relationship to ourselves.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.680]   Dr. Shore is on the faculty
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.920]   in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.200]   at the University of California, Los Angeles
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.320]   School of Medicine.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.880]   He is also the author of several important books,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.080]   including "Right Brain Psychotherapy"
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.160]   and "Development of the Unconscious Mind."
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.640]   Today's discussion with Dr. Shore
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.760]   is an extremely important one for everyone to hear,
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.080]   to understand themselves,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.520]   and to understand the people in their lives.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.360]   Why?
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.720]   Well, we all go through the first 24 months of age.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.800]   You wouldn't be listening to this if you hadn't.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.080]   And during that first 24 months of age,
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.160]   your brain develops in a particular way
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.840]   depending on how you interacted
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.020]   with your primary caretaker,
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.040]   namely your mother,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.320]   but also your father or other primary caretakers.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.980]   In that first 24 months,
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.960]   your right brain and your left brain
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.020]   mediate very specific but different processes.
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.240]   For instance, today you'll learn from Dr. Shore
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.200]   that your right brain circuitry,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.680]   that is specific circuitries
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.800]   on the right-hand side of your brain,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.220]   are involved in developing a very specific type of resonance
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.960]   with your primary caretaker
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.220]   that transitions from states of calm and quiescence
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.280]   that you both share simultaneously
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.200]   to states that are considered upstates of excitement,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.400]   of enthusiasm, of being wide-eyed.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.060]   And the transitioning back and forth between those states,
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.480]   as Dr. Shore explains,
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.880]   is critical to our emotional development
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.120]   and how we form attachments later.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.400]   So if you've heard, for instance,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.240]   of avoidant attachment or anxious attachment
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.680]   or secure attachment,
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.840]   today you'll understand
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.640]   why those particular attachment styles develop,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.400]   how they translate from early life
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.040]   to your adolescence, teen years, and adulthood,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.380]   and in fact, how those childhood attachment patterns,
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.520]   which of course we can't control for ourselves,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.700]   but we can control for our children,
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.200]   how we can modify them through very specific protocols
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.480]   in order to achieve better relations
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.880]   with both others and with ourselves.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.840]   It's indeed a very special conversation.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.160]   And to my knowledge, unlike any other discussions
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.120]   about relationships, neuroscience, or psychology
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.680]   that certainly I have heard before,
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.080]   and I fully expect that for you, it will be as well.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.080]   Before we begin,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.240]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.080]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.240]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.180]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.240]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.720]   to the general public.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.800]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.780]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.800]   Our first sponsor is David.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.480]   David makes a protein bar unlike any other.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.300]   It has 28 grams of protein,
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.040]   only 150 calories, and zero grams of sugar.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   That's right, 28 grams of protein,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.920]   and 75% of its calories come from protein.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.000]   These bars from David also taste amazing.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.300]   My favorite flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough,
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.760]   but then again, I also like the chocolate fudge-flavored one,
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.280]   and I also like the cake-flavored one.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.100]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.640]   They're incredibly delicious.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.620]   For me personally, I strive to eat mostly whole foods.
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.480]   However, when I'm in a rush, or I'm away from home,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.520]   or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack,
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.680]   I often find that I'm looking
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.840]   for a high-quality protein source.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.280]   With David, I'm able to get 28 grams of protein
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.960]   with the calories of a snack,
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.000]   which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.400]   of one gram of protein per pound of body weight each day,
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.720]   and it allows me to do that
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.740]   without taking in excess calories.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.000]   I typically eat a David bar in the early afternoon
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.440]   or even mid-afternoon if I wanna bridge that gap
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.000]   between lunch and dinner.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.280]   I like that it's a little bit sweet,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.800]   so it tastes like a tasty snack,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   but it's also giving me that 28 grams
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.120]   of very high-quality protein with just 150 calories.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.540]   If you would like to try David,
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.860]   you can go to davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.920]   Again, the link is davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.880]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.580]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.220]   with cooling, heating, and sleep-tracking capacity.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.760]   Now, I've spoken before on this podcast
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.960]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.700]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.000]   Now, one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.480]   is to ensure that the temperature
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.560]   of your sleeping environment is correct.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.680]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.500]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.160]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.760]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.920]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.480]   about one to three degrees.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.760]   Eight Sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.200]   of your sleeping environment
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.000]   by allowing you to program the temperature
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.600]   of your mattress cover at the beginning,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.560]   middle, and end of the night.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.360]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.880]   for nearly four years now,
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.640]   and it has completely transformed
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.600]   and improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.880]   Eight Sleep recently launched their newest generation
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.720]   of the pod cover called the Pod4 Ultra.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.760]   The Pod4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.780]   I find that very useful because I like to make the bed
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.400]   really cool at the beginning of the night,
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.220]   even colder in the middle of the night,
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.240]   and warm as I wake up.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   That's what gives me the most slow wave sleep
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.440]   and rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.120]   It also has snoring detection
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.280]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.040]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.920]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.720]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.240]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.360]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Alan Shore.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.120]   Dr. Alan Shore, welcome.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.400]   - Nice to be here.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.620]   - To kick things off, I have a simple question,
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.440]   which is what percentage of our thinking and our behavior
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.320]   do you think is governed by our conscious mind
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.880]   versus our unconscious mind?
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.760]   - You understand that I was trained in psychoanalysis
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.880]   and I'm a psychodynamic psychotherapist
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.200]   in addition to a scientist, neuroscientist.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.120]   So the unconscious has been something
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.720]   that I have been aware of and have been writing about,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.200]   and it's a central part of what I'm writing about
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.040]   to this day, essentially, as we're gonna see.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.840]   I'm suggesting that the right brain
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.400]   is the unconscious mind.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.560]   So when you ask how much of things really are conscious
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.520]   and how much are unconscious,
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.800]   I'm also looking at that neurobiologically
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.980]   in terms of how much of activity
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.400]   is going on in the right brain.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.560]   The right brain is always processing information, always,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.600]   especially emotional information,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.880]   at levels beneath conscious awareness,
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.440]   especially when you're in an emotional interaction.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.000]   So how much really are things conscious?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.900]   I would say that when it comes to the basic motivations
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.440]   of why we do what we do,
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.480]   95 to 90% of that is unconscious.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.480]   And there has been data to show that that is the case.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.560]   At most, although we think that our conscious mind
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.720]   literally is making all of these decisions,
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.400]   underneath that, at all points in time,
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.640]   the unconscious is operating.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.360]   Used to be thought that the unconscious
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.920]   only comes forth in dreams at night.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.200]   But we now know that this right brain
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.340]   is reading unconscious communications between us.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.120]   Communications, is it safe to be with you?
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.920]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.000]   Really, the critical ones always operating
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.200]   and much more important than we had thought itself.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.500]   - Let's start thinking about and talking about
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.840]   this right brain versus left brain thing.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.880]   And what I'd like to know is when we come into this world,
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.840]   how much lateralization, as we call it,
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.360]   how much right versus left brain specialization
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.800]   is there at the time when we exit the womb,
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.920]   when we take our first breath?
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.960]   - The answer to that is pretty clear at this point in time.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.760]   And incidentally, some of these questions
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.040]   about the unconscious are provided by neurobiology.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.600]   But essentially, here's what we know.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.440]   There was discoveries that were being made
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.080]   in the '80s and the '90s about the human brain growth spurt.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.560]   The human brain growth spurt occurs
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.000]   from the last trimester of pregnancy
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.680]   through the second until the third year of life.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.320]   All of that time is a period of right hemisphere dominance.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.600]   And actually, there have been six major studies
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.520]   in neuroscience laboratories around the world
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.320]   that have shown that the right hemisphere
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.360]   is dominant during that period of time.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.960]   In fact, there's a recent study in Mexico
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.360]   where they looked at two to three months,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.120]   six to eight months, nine to 12 months.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.720]   At each point in time, they noticed
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   that the right hemisphere was accelerating its growth,
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.240]   the left was not.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.000]   So the right is dominant very early.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   In fact, there's evidence to show that even in utero,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.680]   there is a right lateralization.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.920]   Now remember, the lateralization is part of all systems.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.880]   And what is lateralized is not only the cortical areas
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.480]   but the subcortical areas, et cetera.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.360]   So if you take, let's say, the amygdala,
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.200]   there's a difference between the right amygdala
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.840]   and the left amygdala, and again, the right hemispheres.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.280]   So the answer to that is very clearly now.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.200]   The left hemisphere does not come into a growth spurt
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.840]   until the end of the second year and into the third year,
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   up until that point, which means everything about attachment
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.080]   is about right brain dynamics.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.680]   - Does that mean that everything about attachment
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.200]   is occurring in the first 24 months?
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.760]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.080]   And it's occurring during that brain growth spurt
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.640]   while the right hemisphere.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.320]   So essentially what you have now
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.880]   is that in the baby's brain,
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.680]   that baby's brain is now in a right brain growth spurt.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.960]   And the mother now is shaping that baby's right brain
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.680]   through the attachment mechanism,
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.520]   through her regulation of that brain.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.600]   So she's helped shaping that brain for better or for worse.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.280]   And incidentally, that means also
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.000]   not only secure attachments, but also the matter,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.600]   because it's for better or worse,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.320]   it's also the early evolution of insecure attachments.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.920]   And we'll talk about what those insecure attachments,
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.720]   all of those really are being shaped by the right.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.120]   What's more, there's evidence to show
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.760]   that it goes right hemisphere,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.760]   then it goes left hemisphere,
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.680]   and then it goes back and to left
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.840]   and back and right along the lifespan.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.000]   So although you have a tremendous growth spurt
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.200]   more than any other time
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.560]   in the first two and a half, three years of life,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.640]   think now about adolescence
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.000]   where you have another growth spurt.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.040]   - Is adolescence marked by a right brain growth spurt?
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.580]   - It's marked by the initially right and then it goes left.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.080]   So essentially, with puberty
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.360]   and with the onset of testosterone
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.920]   and androgens and estrogens,
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.000]   it shifts now into another growth spurt
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.160]   at that point in time.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.840]   Which means, just for the record,
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.960]   now the attachment relationship,
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.840]   which is essentially going to be about
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.400]   how we regulate our emotion,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.240]   because I'll be talking about attachment
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.840]   is about the communication of emotions,
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.720]   right brain to right brain,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.080]   in the first two years of life.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.100]   And about the regulation of emotions
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.500]   in that same period of time, et cetera.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.440]   But ultimately, that leads to the strategies
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.240]   that we have for affect regulation.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.480]   An attachment is essentially affect regulation,
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.720]   affect communication and affect regulation.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.000]   So now what you're looking at,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.780]   if you have a mother and an infant,
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.560]   they are communicating with each other,
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.420]   right brain to right brain,
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.440]   and how are they doing it?
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.480]   By face, voice, and gesture.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.880]   The mother is now reading the expressions
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.280]   of the baby's face, the visual.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.680]   The auditory, the prosody of the voice,
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.800]   and then the tactile.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.240]   So she's picking up these kinds of communications
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.140]   that are coming out of that baby.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.640]   Tactile, gestural, visual.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.920]   And she's now picking up those communications now.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.840]   She's resonating with those communications.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.520]   And then she is gonna regulate those communications.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.080]   And that's essentially what it's about.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.880]   In the end, what we have is strategies of affect regulation.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.560]   How we regulate affect for the rest of our lives
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.160]   depends upon the attachment relationship
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.680]   of the first two years,
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.480]   which is a right brain to right brain connection.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.880]   Now there have been hundreds, thousands of studies
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.300]   on attachment, as you're well aware, at this point in time.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.240]   But the key to it, literally,
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.120]   I began this in 1994 with my first book,
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.880]   Affect Regulation and the Origin of the Self.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.340]   The Neurobiology of Emotional Development, okay?
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.200]   Remember, Bowlby was studying attachment in the '60s.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.520]   But the problem of emotion really was not picked up.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.960]   And early on, when they were looking at attachment,
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.200]   they were looking at behaviors
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.560]   and they were looking at cognition.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.080]   So if you know the attachment literature,
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.620]   remember the strange situation?
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.940]   - Yeah, just to remind listeners,
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.520]   I've talked about this on previous podcasts.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.840]   I'll provide a link to that segment.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.580]   But a strange situation can briefly be described
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.200]   as parent and usually mother and child come into the clinic.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.800]   They deliberately leave the baby with a caretaker.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.380]   This is sort of a pseudo daycare type situation.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.840]   Mother leaves, and then there's a lot of attention paid
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.640]   to how the infant or young child, toddler,
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.980]   whatever age they were looking at, reacts.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.820]   Are they nervous?
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.680]   Are they able to engage in play?
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.160]   And then they look at the return of the mother
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.440]   and how they react to that.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.560]   And there was this classification of behaviors
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.040]   along the lines of secure-attached, insecure-attached.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.320]   There was a categorization
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.740]   of kind of an amalgam of different things,
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.380]   these so-called D-babies
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.920]   that were kind of a bunch of other things.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.440]   And this is where we hear a lot nowadays
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.440]   about secure, insecure, and anxious
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.480]   and avoidant adult relationship styles.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.600]   There's been a lot written about that and talked about that.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.280]   We don't have time to go into all that in detail,
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.160]   but this is what Dr. Shore is referring to.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.080]   I'm really intrigued by this idea
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.560]   that there's a right-brain, left-brain dominance
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.460]   that takes place throughout the lifespan.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.840]   Has it been carefully mapped into adulthood
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.540]   such that we can say as a function of chronological age,
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.280]   you know, when somebody hits their early 30s
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.200]   that they're more right-brain or left-brain dominant?
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.760]   Or is it more developmental milestones
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.540]   as opposed to chronological age?
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.600]   - I think it's developmental milestones there.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.960]   You know, I'm thinking that,
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.280]   remember Eric Erickson talking about different stages
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.600]   of life and how you have a hierarchy here,
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.960]   literally, because the attachment is a hierarchy.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.880]   It starts subcortical and then it goes to cortical.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.440]   So what he said was that there are changes along the line
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.780]   and that it fits with that.
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.200]   So the attachment relationship is there
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.840]   at later points in time, and really what it does,
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.640]   it guides us through our relationships with other people.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.960]   It certainly guides us through strategies
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.520]   of what to do with stress.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.260]   And that way that we deal with that stress
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.960]   is now going to depend upon how the mother
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.840]   is regulating that baby's stress during a critical period.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.840]   Now, the term critical period is an important one here too,
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.440]   because again, at the first two years of life,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.520]   it's the right brain is in that critical period there.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.440]   But that leads to strategies of affect regulation
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.360]   of how we deal with stress,
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.280]   but also how we deal with novel situations.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.080]   And again, all of it has to do with emotion.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.840]   Now, I jumped there because I talked about
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.600]   there was attachment models move from behavior
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.920]   to cognition to emotion.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.200]   And essentially, the first book that I wrote
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.760]   was on the neurobiology of emotional development.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.280]   And in 1994, when I came out with that book,
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.920]   that was about the same time that Antonio Damasio
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.520]   came out with his book.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.200]   And really, it was not until the mid '90s,
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.000]   partly because of the neuroimaging,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.080]   which was coming during,
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.960]   you remember the decade of the brain,
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.000]   that emotion really now became a matter
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.640]   that science was looking at for the first time.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.800]   The point that I'm making here
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   is that attachment is not psychological,
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.800]   it's psychobiological.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.620]   And there was always this rift
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.480]   between the psychological and the biological.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.560]   But when you're talking about emotions,
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.840]   you're not only talking about psychological events,
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.000]   you're talking about physiological events
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.240]   that are associated with those events.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.800]   For example, the physiology of the stress response,
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.920]   the physiology of the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.840]   which is energy expending,
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.000]   and the parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.440]   which is energy conserving.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.200]   So the mother is a regulator of that.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.280]   And the way that she's a regulator of that baby
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.480]   is that she's tracking that baby's arousal levels.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.680]   She's tracking that baby's emotions
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.600]   as they change in time, moment to moment.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   And then she's synchronizing with that,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.920]   and that allows her now to be able to regulate it.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.440]   So we're going from recognizing that baby's emotions,
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.520]   synchronizing with those emotions,
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.280]   and then being an affect regulator.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.560]   So the mother, who is securely attached now,
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.200]   is a good affect regulator of that baby.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.520]   She not only is an affect regulator
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.220]   of the negative states of the baby,
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.680]   because negative states and negative affects
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.720]   are adaptive by definition.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.560]   - Baby cries, mother nurses baby.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.400]   - And that's a signal she's sending there, literally,
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.400]   and the mother then intuitively knows.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.480]   Intuitively knows.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.720]   She's not using her left brain
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.200]   to figure out what to do with that baby.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.840]   She's doing it intuitively.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.640]   And intuition is a right brain function.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.980]   And she's regulating that baby implicitly.
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.980]   Now, let's go back over implicit to explicit, okay?
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.160]   You're seeing a lot now
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.600]   about the shift from explicit to implicit.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.120]   Something that is implicit
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.560]   goes on at levels beneath awareness.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.920]   So when she is intuitively knowing what to do,
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.440]   that right now this baby is down-regulating too much,
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.360]   and she wants to bring that baby up,
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.960]   she'll now use her tone of voice, literally,
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.320]   to raise that baby up into a more excited state.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.080]   Or if the baby is dysregulated, sympathetic hyperarousal,
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.160]   she knows how to down-regulate that.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.040]   And she'll down-regulate that by her facial expression,
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.440]   by the tone of her voice.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.720]   Now her tone of her voice is now trying to soften
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.260]   and to quiet down.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.880]   So essentially what attachment is
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.640]   is the regulator of arousal, of emotional arousal.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.040]   And that emotional arousal also includes
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.360]   the autonomic nervous system.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.280]   So what we have here is the regulation attachment
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.500]   of the limbic system, the emotion-processing limbic system,
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.740]   positive and negative, and the autonomic nervous system.
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.880]   So they are limbic autonomic circuits.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.680]   And those circuits are in the right brain.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.760]   Now on this matter,
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.120]   as it turns out, the right brain
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.360]   has a control system of attachment.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.060]   Now since the right brain is there first before the left,
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.440]   because there's no speech at two years,
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.680]   she's regulating this baby at two months,
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.120]   six months, 12 months.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.160]   All of it is occurring non-verbal.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.760]   She's doing this implicitly, not explicitly.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.760]   The left hemisphere processes explicit stimuli,
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.760]   conscious stimuli, rational stimuli.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.320]   That's not there.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.280]   Everything is being done implicitly
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.980]   beneath levels of awareness.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.360]   And again, that allows her to be the regulation.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.640]   So attachment theory, my attachment theory,
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.480]   regulation theory is essentially
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.180]   attachment is interactive regulation.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.160]   Stay with me now.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.320]   Ultimately, what we have are two forms of regulation.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.540]   What we're doing is we're regulating the self, right?
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.840]   I mean, it's the subjective self,
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.680]   which is in the right hemisphere.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.760]   The left is subjective self.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.320]   The left is verbal, conscious.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.600]   She's regulating the right hemisphere,
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.960]   and she's doing that, again,
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.400]   by tracking the baby's emotional states, as I said.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.920]   But again, what the child learns now from that
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   is that her right brain is becoming more and more complex
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.820]   from the first year to the second year.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.520]   And it's gonna turn out some of these functions
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.220]   that are more complex are being also stimulated
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.160]   by the mother.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.800]   And ultimately, by the end of the second year,
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.080]   that baby can regulate its emotional states by itself.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.580]   In its right brain.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:31.340]   But we have two forms of regulation.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.360]   You can regulate your states by auto-regulation,
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.600]   by yourself.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.640]   In other words, you're not with other human beings
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.140]   at this point in time.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.320]   You have an efficient right brain, which can regulate.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.200]   And incidentally, what we're talking about here
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.560]   is the regulation of the amygdala
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.220]   by the right orbital frontal cortex.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.680]   The right orbital frontal cortex
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.200]   is the highest level of the right hemisphere.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.120]   It also has the most sophisticated
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.320]   and the latest evolving parts of the brain
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.300]   are in the right frontal cortex.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.320]   Not the left.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.760]   The right orbital frontal.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.920]   Not the left dorsolateral cortex is the key to this.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.820]   So what we learn from attachment here, again,
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.920]   is how to, both in a secure attachment,
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.020]   how to auto-regulate your emotions
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.400]   when you're apart from people.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.180]   In other words, you go to a quiet place
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.400]   at this point in time,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.760]   you're regulating yourself down, so to speak,
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.480]   and you're getting a nice regulation of the amygdala
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.920]   by the right orbital frontal cortex.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.080]   Or interactive regulation,
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.660]   which is now you go to another human being.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:44.360]   We go to another human being under times of stress
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.320]   in an optimal situation.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.920]   We also go to another human being to share joy states.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.360]   And remember, I said that the mother
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.600]   is up-regulating joy states
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.480]   and down-regulating negative states.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.600]   So in a secure attachment,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.000]   you have somebody now who can do both.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.840]   In certain forms of insecure attachment,
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.680]   that's not gonna happen.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.040]   The avoidant attachment
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.980]   is always auto-regulating his states.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.260]   - So just so I'm clear,
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.440]   in avoidant attachment,
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.400]   the baby, which is now, let's say,
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.740]   two and a half years old,
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.360]   three years old-- - That's already a toddler.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.760]   - That's a toddler, excuse me.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.160]   The toddler is auto-regulating more often
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.800]   than seeking another to help do coordinated regulation.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.720]   - Yeah, what I'm saying is a secure attachment.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.800]   And let me back up a step on it.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.060]   The key to attachment
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.880]   is psychobiological attunement.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.080]   You know the phrase.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.120]   Notice psychobiological attunement,
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.240]   that the mother is regulating
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.400]   not only the psychological aspect,
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.360]   but literally is as regulating
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.360]   the physiological aspect of that,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.240]   which means that she's regulating
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.760]   the autonomic nervous system.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:06.200]   Think about porgous social engagement system.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.800]   What we have here is the capacity
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.840]   by insecure attachment who have,
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.300]   and then the second part of the attachment is repair.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.400]   Now let me go back.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.800]   Psychobiological attunement.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.720]   Sometimes she misattunes.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.320]   Sometimes she misreads the baby states
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.620]   for one reason or another.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.760]   What happens in a good enough caregiving
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.760]   is that the mother who was misattuned
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.200]   now returns to that baby,
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.460]   now re-synchronizes with that baby,
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.520]   now reconnects right brains to right brains with that baby.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.080]   And that repair is the key here.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.380]   So you have misattunement and repair.
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.260]   So the key to a secure attachment
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.820]   is not only psychobiological attunement,
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.700]   but it's also the repair of the misattunement.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.700]   And that allows the baby now to expand that situation
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.220]   and being able to use that now to order a case.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.100]   That's a secure.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.880]   But if she misattunes, for example,
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.420]   and doesn't repair, let's say,
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.840]   or she's not that good at psychobiologically attuning,
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.400]   let's say as an avoidant mother,
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.700]   because avoidant personalities are uncomfortable
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.420]   with real closeness.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.580]   Another term for an avoidant personality
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.020]   is a dismissive personality.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.940]   And what they are dismissing
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.420]   is the need for interactive regulation.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.960]   So they're always auto-regulating.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.600]   Or you have another time
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.360]   in which you have another form of attachment,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.560]   an insecure anxious attachment.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:47.160]   Where that person is always interactively regulating,
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.160]   or is always going to others to help them regulate,
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.060]   but can't auto-regulate.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.240]   - I think this is a really important thing
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.620]   to hover on for a moment,
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.920]   just given some context
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.760]   about hundreds of thousands of questions
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.760]   that I get about avoidant versus secure
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.640]   versus anxious attach.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.000]   And you stated it all incredibly clearly,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.460]   but I wanna make sure that we double-click on this
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.300]   as they say.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:17.520]   The idea that if a child and mother
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.600]   did not coordinate their autonomic-
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.820]   - Use the word synchronize.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.400]   - Synchronize.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.720]   Did not synchronize their autonomic regulation
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.560]   in the proper way
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.440]   that there would be a non-secure attachment.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.720]   I'm using that language for a specific reason.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.960]   Makes total sense.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.480]   But this idea that if the child,
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.080]   which soon the baby,
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.140]   which is a toddler at three or so,
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.960]   is avoidant,
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.600]   then they're going to have to learn to auto-regulate,
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.720]   and they're going to seek others
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.520]   to help them regulate less than a secure attached.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.200]   And the anxious attached,
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.720]   baby, toddler, adolescent, adult,
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.680]   will do just the opposite.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.940]   They're gonna have a hard time self-soothing,
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.120]   but they are going to feel,
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.080]   let's say that these might be the kind of people
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.960]   that don't well tolerate a text message
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.060]   not getting responded to at a very short latency,
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:12.900]   for instance.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.440]   And we all, depending on context, we have this, right?
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.060]   But I find this to be incredibly important,
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.780]   which is why I wanted to go back through it,
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.320]   because I think nowadays,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.140]   we hear so much about anxious and securely attached,
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:27.980]   avoidant, et cetera,
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.500]   in the context of adult romantic relationships.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.500]   But I hope that people are realizing
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.860]   the truly incredible importance of your work,
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.260]   which is that the same circuitry and mechanisms
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:43.120]   that are used to establish infant mother attachment
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   are repurposed later in life for adult relationships.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.000]   I think that when we hear that, it makes sense,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.640]   but I don't think that most people know that.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.280]   They assume somehow that there's circuitry
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.480]   in our brain and body for adult romantic attachment
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.360]   that is distinct from our attachment circuitry
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.600]   that we had with our parent.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   And I think your work speaks very loudly
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.800]   that they are in fact the exact same circuitry.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   - All of this is happening in the right brain, all of it.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.160]   And incidentally, attachment relationship
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.880]   is retained as an autobiographical memory
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.680]   in the first two years of life, even before.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.980]   There's a left hemisphere,
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.200]   and that under later stress situation,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.240]   that will be the key there.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.560]   Incidentally, the attachment,
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.080]   whether it's secure or insecure,
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.520]   is also the key to positive and negative transferences.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.080]   That's where it's communicated.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.300]   Let me go back and say a little bit more
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.160]   about one other form of attachment,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.200]   and that you mentioned the type D attachment.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.520]   - The D babies, disorganized.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.200]   - Disorganized babies.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.000]   So you have secure.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.120]   You have two types of organized insecures.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.160]   Okay, the avoidant and the anxious.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.760]   And then you have a disorganized, disoriented one.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.760]   Now, ultimately, that person under stress
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.160]   is not able to autoregulate or to interact and regulate.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.000]   So what they will do at that point,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.520]   now I'm now thinking about, let's say PTSD,
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.080]   various borderline personality disorders.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.440]   That person now literally can't go to the other
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.680]   for autoregulation or interact regulation.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.380]   That person now will use a defense,
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.720]   literally to shut down the attachment system.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.040]   And that's exactly what dissociation is.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.600]   Dissociation just shuts down the attachment.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.960]   So in the anxious attachment,
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   you have a continual activation of the attachment system,
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.400]   which means a continual activation of the right hemisphere
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.240]   all of the time.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   And in the insecure dismissive attachment,
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.360]   you have a deactivation of the attachment system,
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.840]   which would be a deactivation of the right brain.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:01.000]   So in the end, a secure attachment is an efficient one,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.120]   but it's an efficient one
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.800]   that can switch back and forth between them.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.000]   Not only that, it also, at a later point in time,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.820]   when the left comes online,
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.560]   it can also communicate much better
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.980]   with the left hemisphere than without that.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.200]   Regulation theory is essentially a theory
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:23.160]   of the development of the self in an optimal situation,
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:27.400]   but it also talks about the psychopathogenesis of the self,
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.640]   the early origins of psychiatric disorders
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.120]   and personality disorders.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.820]   I'm thinking about not only schizophrenia and depression,
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:40.040]   but I'm now thinking about narcissistic personality disorders,
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.520]   borderline personality disorders.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.000]   Maybe we'll come back to more on that.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.600]   And then ultimately, the repair of the self.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.840]   So regulation theory is about the development of the self,
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.600]   the psychopathogenesis of the self,
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.160]   and then the repair of the self.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.320]   Because these attachment situations
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.720]   are now going to play out under all periods of stress.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.160]   The right hemisphere is dominant for the stress response.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.860]   The right hemisphere is dominant
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.240]   for the sympathetic nervous system, the energy expending,
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.520]   and the right hemisphere is dominant
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.380]   for the parasympathetic nervous system.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.960]   So again, all of that will play out
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.640]   at later points under stress.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.840]   And when those systems break down,
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.500]   that's when the patient will form symptomatologies
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.400]   and come into therapy.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   And in therapy, the therapist now, the key,
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.680]   I'm jumping here.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.600]   - No, this is great.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.800]   - Because there's a right brain to right brain interaction
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.500]   between the mother and the infant.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.000]   There's also a right brain to right brain interaction
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.280]   between the therapist and the patient.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.280]   And the key to both of them is regulation.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.480]   Person is coming in in a dysregulated state.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.220]   The key to that is regulation.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.240]   And the key to any form of therapy,
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   whatever the form of it is, again is interactive regulation
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.080]   and it's a therapeutic relationship.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.740]   The thing which is the best indicator
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.960]   of whether somebody will do well out of therapy
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.520]   and whether a clinician will do well out of therapy
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.760]   is how well they can deal with the therapeutic relationship.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.900]   And a really good therapist literally knows
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.320]   how to bring back those attachment things there
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.800]   because now the person is starting
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.360]   to feel safety and trusted.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.020]   And incidentally, attachment is about safety and trust,
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.020]   which is very much autonomic.
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:41.640]   But again here, the key to therapy
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.620]   is being able to form a therapeutic relationship
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.460]   with the patient.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:50.360]   So the key here is can the therapist form,
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.080]   co-create a therapeutic relationship
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.120]   with an avoidant patient, with a secure patient,
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.600]   with anxious patient, with a borderline patient.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.560]   As you can imagine, the toughest thing
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.880]   is gonna be able to do with the borderline patient
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.560]   or the schizophrenic patient.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.440]   So what you have here is that the attachment dynamics
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.680]   are building out.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.820]   So in the very first session, what's happening,
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:19.120]   the therapist is listening to the verbalizations
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.800]   of the patient in order to diagnose
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.400]   and understand the symptomatology.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   But the therapist is also listening beneath the words.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.120]   And the patient is tracking the attachment relationship
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.400]   underneath it, tracking the arousal
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.120]   and the arousal dysregulation underneath that,
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.320]   tracking it in his own body, so to speak, et cetera.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.080]   And again, that is a different type of listening.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.580]   Again, the therapist is listening to a left brain,
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.880]   but more or less, the therapist is listening
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.440]   to the right brain.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.360]   And the question is, how does the therapist do that?
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.360]   And in order, just for the record, for the therapist
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.160]   to be able to get to the attachment dynamics, which
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.640]   are right lateralized, the therapist
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.780]   has got to switch out of the left into the right.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.160]   And there's a term for that.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.480]   The term for that is surrender, surrender.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.360]   You cannot consciously, purposely put yourself
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.260]   into the right.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.440]   You've got to let go.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.040]   You've got to let go, let it be, so to speak.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.520]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, AG1.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.880]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.320]   with adaptogens.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.200]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.680]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.880]   The reason I started taking AG1 and the reason
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.880]   I still take AG1 once and often twice a day
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.400]   is because it is the highest quality
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.280]   and most complete foundational nutritional supplement.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   What that means is that AG1 ensures
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.040]   that you're getting all the necessary vitamins, minerals,
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.680]   and other micronutrients to form a strong foundation
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.080]   for your daily health.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.720]   AG1 also has probiotics and prebiotics
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.680]   that support a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.680]   Your gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.360]   that align your digestive tract and impact things
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.880]   such as your immune system status,
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.880]   your metabolic health, your hormone health, and much more.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.880]   So I've consistently found that when I take AG1 daily,
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.080]   my digestion is improved, my immune system is more robust,
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.920]   I rarely get sick, and my mood and mental focus
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.000]   are at their best.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.220]   In fact, if I could take just one supplement,
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.440]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.840]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.060]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.280]   to claim a special offer.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.280]   For this month only, November 2024,
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.760]   AG1 is giving away one free month supply
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.240]   of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.320]   in addition to the usual welcome kit
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.560]   of five free travel packs and a year supply
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.960]   of vitamin D3K2 with your order.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.520]   Omega-3 fatty acids are critical for brain health,
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.640]   mood, cognition, and much more.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.080]   Again, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.620]   to claim this special offer.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.420]   Tell me more about surrender.
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.360]   And I just wanna make sure I understand,
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.920]   this is surrender on the part of the therapist
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.320]   trying to, yes, listen to the narrative
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.080]   that the patient is sharing,
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.400]   but also paying attention to the underlying emotional state.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.520]   Is the person quaking?
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.560]   Are they angry?
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:17.560]   Is there feelings of despair, shock?
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.000]   - Hyperarousal. - Disgust, right.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.360]   Right, so they're carrying this in their parallel tracks.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.520]   And then is the goal of the therapist,
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.760]   if they're an effective one, to then soothe the patient?
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.360]   Or is it to allow the patient
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.040]   to have some sort of catharsis, some release of this?
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.360]   Like at what point does the therapist intervene
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.980]   and try and coordinate and show the patient
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:44.280]   a different way to think about and feel about the topic?
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.280]   - All right, what I'm suggesting here
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.800]   is that essentially the therapist
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.880]   is listening left brain to left brain,
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.560]   but the therapist also is always listening
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.840]   beneath the words, et cetera.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.420]   And he's listening to the right brain
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.200]   to right brain communication.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.920]   And the patient now who is depressed
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.420]   is coming out with right brain communications.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.080]   There's sadness in the voice.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.720]   The face is clearly dysregulated.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.720]   And essentially, as the therapist is tracking that,
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.280]   the emotional arousal,
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.040]   whether it's into hypoarousal and depression
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.720]   or hyperarousal into anxiety,
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.400]   the first thing there is to synchronize with that patient
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   so that my physiology is syncing with their physiology.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.560]   And now through the right insula,
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:36.560]   interoceptively, I now literally am feeling in my body
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.580]   what the patient is feeling in their body.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:45.440]   I now understand that patient from the inside out.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.440]   And incidentally, what I'm picking up in my body
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.520]   about the dysregulation of that patient
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.640]   may be very different than the verbal report
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.040]   that that patient is giving at that time.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.840]   But the key here, literally, just like the mother,
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.480]   is synchronizing with that baby's crescendos
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.040]   and the decrescendos of that autonomic state,
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.300]   of those emotional state.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.920]   I'm picking up those points
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.500]   where they are shifting into and out of an emotional state.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.200]   I'm synchronizing with that.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.080]   And then ultimately,
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.160]   when I'm in sync with that kind of thing,
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.440]   then at that point, purely implicitly,
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.720]   I'm now starting to slow the tone of my voice
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.440]   if I want to reduce that arousal down,
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.520]   or I'm upregulating the voice.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.760]   At that point in time, I am now interactively regulating.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.840]   And we are now synchronized together.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.720]   So essentially, what's gonna happen
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.840]   is that as we synchronize,
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.260]   as they're going to dysregulation,
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.300]   we're now synchronizing together
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.840]   as we're going down into regulation.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   - So the therapist can literally and somatically
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:00.680]   show the patient what autoregulation is like,
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.640]   or what coordinated regulation is like.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.400]   - And you'll see it on my face.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.680]   Face, voice, gesture.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.980]   You'll see it on my face.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.440]   You'll see it in the tone of my voice.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.120]   You'll see it in my gestures.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.880]   Those three sensory modalities
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.080]   are now going back and forth between us.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.600]   So the key of the first session, literally,
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.880]   is not only to diagnose.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.880]   Really, it's to start to begin
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.920]   to synchronize with that patient
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.840]   and to form a therapeutic alliance with that patient.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.000]   And at the end of the first session,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.560]   the patient may say, "I don't know why,
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.480]   "but I'm feeling better.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.380]   "And I have some idea that you can understand,
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.680]   "but it's gotta be more than that,
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.500]   "what I am feeling," literally.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.880]   - So often nowadays, I think we hear
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.640]   that adult romantic relationships
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:58.640]   can provide a healing of some of the failures
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.860]   of childhood attachment.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:05.360]   And there's also a phrase thrown around a lot
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.360]   that we need to learn to parent ourselves.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.640]   This is more of a pop psychology,
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.160]   online, social media thing,
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.840]   that people need to learn to mother and father themselves
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.240]   at some level to self-soothe and to,
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.160]   who knows what that means?
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.440]   I'm not gonna try and define it.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.360]   It's not operationally defined.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.560]   So the question I have is to what extent
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.320]   do you think the process that you just described
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.280]   with the therapist can start to rewire
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:38.840]   some of the capacity to auto-regulate
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.560]   or coordinated regulate?
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:45.560]   - Essentially here, what you have is over time,
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.080]   partly because of this synchrony.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.760]   First of all, let me spell synchrony with a capital S.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.980]   What I mean by that is in the last five years,
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.960]   a huge amount of information has come out
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.260]   about this idea about interpersonal synchrony.
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.760]   The term synchrony comes from the Greek,
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.820]   sync meaning the same, chrony, time, same time.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.460]   So that literally two people literally are synchronized.
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.880]   We are feeling something in the same moment
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.720]   and we are feeling it spontaneously between ourselves.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.920]   We are feeling that kind of situation.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.280]   So again here, the key to the mother
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.320]   really even more than the auto-regulation,
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.360]   the key is interactive regulation, number one.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.940]   Number two, it's occurring at an implicit level.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.160]   The mother literally is doing this
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.200]   without any conscious awareness.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.580]   She's doing this intuitively.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.960]   The right hemisphere is intuitive and it's imagistic.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.520]   It's not rational and logical.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.120]   The key to any disorder, whatever it is,
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.760]   is the regulation of a particular state.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.620]   The regulation of rage, the regulation of loss,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.640]   the regulation, the dysregulation of shame or disgust.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.920]   So essentially what you have is the regulation
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.000]   of all of these emotions.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.120]   But that regulation, I want to point out, is all implicit.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.720]   And here's where the skill of being with patients
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.000]   over long periods of time is the key here.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.440]   Because the key to making changes in the patient
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.920]   is not what you say to the patient
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.220]   or what you do to the patient,
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.280]   it's how to be with the patient.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.540]   You understand the difference, how to be with that patient,
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.720]   especially while that person's being
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.820]   is in a dysregulated state.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.160]   Now by definition, when they're coming in
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.800]   on the first session, they are in a dysregulated state.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.520]   So again, it's implicit, it's not explicit.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:42.860]   If explicit regulation is an intellectual understanding
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:49.180]   of my symptoms, implicit is an understanding
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.740]   an unconscious understanding at a physiological level,
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.540]   at a psychobiological level of that.
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:01.540]   And incidentally, synchrony is the mechanism
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.660]   underneath empathy.
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:09.060]   Now, we know, empathy literally has to be there.
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.300]   But empathy is a right brain function.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.780]   And there is a difference.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.060]   I said there's a difference in the hemispheres.
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.480]   There's a difference between emotional empathy,
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.820]   where I am feeling what you are feeling,
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.040]   and we are sharing the same feeling.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.080]   And I don't have to think about that literally.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.260]   I know at that point in time we are in the same place.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.420]   There's a difference between emotional empathy on the right
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.100]   and cognitive empathy on the left.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.980]   Cognitive empathy is an understanding.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.820]   It makes no changes.
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.580]   Because essentially what we're attempting to do
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.300]   is make the changes in the right.
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.740]   Now, the changes in the right are going to be
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.160]   in the right axis.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.040]   They're going to be the orbitofrontal cortex,
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.860]   which is the executive regulator of the right brain.
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:02.940]   The dorsolateral cortex is the executive regulator
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.380]   of the left brain.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:08.880]   The orbitofrontal cortex now starts to form new connections
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.560]   with the cingulate, the insula, and the amygdala.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.040]   And that's where you're now going to see the changes.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.920]   But again, the changes are due to the regulation.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.680]   So you'll see the person now starting to come
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.080]   into more regulated states.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.400]   And the key is synchrony.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.920]   So what's happening here,
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.440]   there's a strong therapeutic alliance,
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.080]   safety and trust.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.300]   And in that situation now,
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:40.000]   the more synchrony that is there between the two,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.880]   the more interactive regulation there is between the two.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.760]   And first there will be synchrony
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.540]   between the patient and the therapist.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.080]   Then there will be synchrony and interact regulation
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.580]   between that person and maybe other people,
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.040]   maybe a wife, a partner.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.360]   And ultimately in the symptomatology will change.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:03.280]   'Cause remember the symptomatology is dysregulation.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.280]   And the whole key is to change it to regulation.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.880]   - It's fascinating.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.440]   There are a couple of questions I have
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.040]   before we move forward about mother-infant attachment
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.720]   as opposed to father-infant attachment.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.560]   So that's one.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.780]   And I'll ask these again in a moment.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.920]   But I think you'll see where I'm going here.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.720]   And then I'm fascinated by the idea
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.780]   that these circuits get established early in life,
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.400]   then are repurposed for adult relationships.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.560]   They can be modified in the way that you just described.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   But that they cross gender and gender lines.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:45.440]   So for instance, a female baby
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.760]   can form these patterns of attachment
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.560]   with their mother, female caretaker.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.400]   But then assuming that baby grows up
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.240]   to be a heterosexual woman,
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.040]   and she has attachments to men,
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.960]   then these things can be reactivated
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.480]   across gender lines, right?
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:07.400]   So this formation of the circuitry is not gender-specific,
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.320]   although it sounds like it's important
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.400]   that it be the mother to child in some way.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.960]   You keep saying mother-child as opposed to caretaker.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.240]   So to just spell them out one by one,
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.840]   first question, are there any data
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.100]   about the formation of the circuits in the baby
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.200]   where the mother is either not available,
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.480]   if it's an adopted mother,
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.560]   if it's a child raised by extended family?
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.600]   I mean, there's so many different configurations,
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.640]   but you get the point.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.320]   - All right, here's what I'm suggesting.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.120]   First of all, there has been some conflict on this,
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.160]   but after 30 years on this,
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:49.600]   I believe that there is a primary attachment figure.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.900]   And the primary attachment figure
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.360]   is the person who is the interactive regulator
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.020]   of that baby when that baby is under stress.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.840]   - Between age zero and two.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.540]   - Yeah, or let me say it even another way.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.520]   The primary attachment figure
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:07.000]   is the person who provides the right brain for that baby
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.160]   when that baby's right brain is dysregulated.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.780]   - Could be dad, could be mom.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.940]   - Could be.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.920]   Yes, it's true, women are better
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.600]   at reading nonverbal cues than men are, but it could be.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.360]   And incidentally, we now have some evidence
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.380]   that's showing that men do have right brains.
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.760]   (laughing)
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.820]   - For a second there, I wasn't sure if you were joking,
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.040]   but I don't know, maybe that's reflective
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:31.880]   of a natural being right brain.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.880]   - Yeah, yeah, all right, now that being the case,
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.820]   what's happening here is that in the first year or two,
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.040]   the mother's right brain,
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.740]   she is the person who is the right brain,
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.160]   which in most cultures is a woman.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.720]   But does not have to be, it could be a stay-at-home dad
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.600]   who literally has a good right brain,
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.320]   and maybe a couple are figuring out that literally,
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.900]   you know, he'd be better in that position,
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.440]   but it needs that right brain.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.240]   But other than that, what happens here,
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.720]   when it goes now into the second year,
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.800]   toward the end of second year,
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.000]   and the father comes online, got me?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.200]   At that point in time,
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.560]   the father now becomes a primary attachment figure also.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.880]   But he has some differences,
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.520]   the way that he's dealing with that baby.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.440]   He's usually more arousing with that baby,
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.960]   and that the play is more arousing with that baby.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.560]   - So more activation of the sympathetic autonomic.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.400]   - Yeah.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.280]   - So sort of more up, let's call it up-level play.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.840]   - Exactly, you're dealing with more up-regulation,
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.240]   and being able to tolerate more hyper-aroused states.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.800]   Because in the second year,
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.120]   one of the things that the father will do with the infant
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.880]   is with toddler, infant first year, toddler second year,
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.880]   rough and tumble play, for example, rough and tumble play.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:41.840]   So the father is that.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.440]   So the father literally is now teaching the child
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.400]   literally how to take risks,
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:50.160]   but the father is now moving more towards autonomy
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.520]   and independence.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.440]   The mother was there at the beginning
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.080]   about interactive regulation,
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.600]   but so the father is playing that role.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:03.440]   And I've also suggested that just as the mother
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:08.120]   is shaping that baby's right brain in the first year,
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.920]   the father is now shaping that baby's left brain
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.160]   towards the end of the first year,
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.800]   second, and into the third year.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.760]   That he's shaping that baby's,
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.520]   his left brain to that baby's left brain.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.520]   That being the case, he may also, earlier on,
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:30.520]   have had good experiences with that baby early on in life.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.400]   And a good example of that would be
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.440]   a father who is tender, tender,
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.040]   yet at the same time is instrumental
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.240]   and is teaching things about the world.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:46.120]   So one brain is shaped by the mother figure,
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.120]   the brother by the father figure.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.880]   - What about under situations
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.760]   where there's really just one primary caretaker?
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.560]   This is increasingly common nowadays.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.480]   And in some countries,
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.080]   like in certain Scandinavian countries,
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.880]   people opt to do this, and elsewhere, of course,
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.680]   but this isn't always a divorce situation.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.560]   Sometimes people decide to have children on their own.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.600]   - You know, I think what's happening
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.960]   in that kind of situation
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:16.080]   is the person is initially providing the right brain
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:20.880]   and then that person is now providing the left brain.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.440]   So let's say as a single woman with a child,
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.160]   her right brain is there on the get,
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.720]   but then in the second year,
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.000]   and incidentally, there may be father figures
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   or family members who also can step into that,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.880]   but essentially her left brain is there also.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.440]   Remember, we both have right brains and left brains,
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.760]   but again, that's a different kinds of skill
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.560]   in a left brain,
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.120]   which would be the more autonomous situation.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.960]   - What are your thoughts about some of the
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.080]   modern exploration of compounds
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.480]   that can facilitate more right brain synchrony
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.440]   between therapist and patient?
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.680]   I've done a few episodes about MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:11.680]   These, of course, were just recently not approved by the FDA,
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.600]   so these are not legal.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.680]   Nonetheless, there are interesting clinical studies
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.520]   showing that these are in pathogens.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.480]   One could imagine that they could be useful
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.880]   in the proper context to improve
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:30.800]   patient-therapist right brain synchrony
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.520]   and accelerate some of this process,
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.240]   but it seems like it would also require
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.000]   both the patient and the therapist taking the compound,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.040]   and that seems like it would have
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.280]   all sorts of ethical issues.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.920]   Remember, it's the relationship in the end
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.120]   that is the key there.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:52.120]   I was also somewhat aware of that literature,
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.520]   and you used the word empathogen,
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:58.400]   which is not quite straight out empathic,
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.120]   but mimicking those kinds of situations there.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:07.040]   My thought is that that might be more efficacious
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:12.640]   if it were specifically involving right brain dynamics
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:17.040]   with a person who knew how to work with those right brain.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.280]   What you're getting there are very early forms
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.320]   of the behaviors which are subcortical.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.520]   Remember, the attachment is also regulating
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.840]   the subcortical areas, and those are the key ones,
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.720]   and incidentally, we are paying too much attention
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.040]   to the cortical area.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.400]   We literally have to shift,
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.880]   because the subcortical areas are the foundations
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.720]   of the human, and everything is built on top of that.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.880]   I'll come back to in utero in a second
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.080]   if I don't get on that.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.480]   In fact, I have some people who have worked with me
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.800]   have also been using right brain-type psychotherapy
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.880]   in that, with those patients,
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.320]   and I think that that will be
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:56.320]   really interesting possibilities of seeing changes
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:01.320]   where you have the relationship in addition to that,
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:05.800]   and also some understanding about how the right brain works,
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.360]   because one of the problems that you have
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.360]   where there is still some resistance,
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.320]   the idea that the right brain is just a simpler version
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.320]   of the complex left hemisphere,
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.440]   but that's not the case.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.560]   This right brain is working completely differently,
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.440]   so I'm thinking that in that case,
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.680]   a better situation.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:32.680]   Before I forget this, I wanna just throw one other piece in.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.360]   I said that the right brain is in a growth spurt
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.640]   from the last trimester.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:42.680]   In the last five years, 10 years,
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.720]   there has been a real interest in utero development,
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.520]   and evidence to show
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.040]   that you're even seeing lateralization in the fetus,
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.520]   and so, and there's even evidence now,
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:57.600]   scientifical evidence to show that the early memories
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:01.080]   in utero are stored in the right amygdala,
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.000]   so they're down there, so to speak.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.320]   So we're now paying more and more attention
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.960]   to what is happening there,
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.440]   because at birth, literally what you have here
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:12.200]   is the deeper parts of the right brain
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:17.200]   are evolving in utero, the insula and the right amygdala,
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:21.080]   the central amygdala, and that's setting up,
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:25.960]   and you also have synchronization across the placenta,
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.840]   whereby they are regulating each other's
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.440]   autonomic nervous systems.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.840]   - Can adrenaline pass across the placenta?
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.800]   I should know this.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.080]   I know adrenaline doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier,
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.000]   but the brain makes its own adrenaline,
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   but do we know if adrenaline crosses
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.680]   the placental barrier? - Well, first of all,
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.440]   most of the studies have been on cortisol,
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.080]   and high levels of cortisol, they're gonna cross it.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.800]   So if you have, let's say the amygdala,
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.120]   which is in a critical period of growth,
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.880]   the right amygdala, and the cortisol levels are very high,
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.240]   that's really going to not be an optimal situation
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.740]   for that amygdala to evolve,
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.120]   because you're going to have a continuous stress response
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.800]   there, and essentially what that means also,
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.120]   that if the mother is in a very stressed state
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.680]   during a utero, some of that literally now
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.800]   is going to impact the lower areas of the brain.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:18.220]   So as far as adrenaline goes, I'm not sure on that.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:23.220]   I don't see why not, although hormones certainly cross.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:28.840]   We're looking at not only changes in neuromodulators,
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.960]   especially, incidentally, the key here
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.240]   that we're trying to regulate are the neuromodulators.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   Excuse me, dopamine, reward, noradrenaline, adrenaline.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.520]   It's those, which also early in life,
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.580]   literally form neuroplastic, so they will form circuits.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:50.500]   That's what we're attempting to regulate here,
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.960]   to downregulate very high levels of noradrenaline,
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.460]   and upregulate dopamine, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.840]   - I'd like to take a quick break,
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.540]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.160]   I recently became a Function member
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.460]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.480]   to lab testing.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.400]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.360]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.000]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.880]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.660]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:21.920]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.360]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.080]   Function not only provides testing
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.520]   of over a hundred biomarkers,
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.200]   key to physical and mental health,
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.060]   but it also analyzes these results,
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:35.620]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.460]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.580]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:42.900]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.700]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.560]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.060]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:52.740]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:55.060]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:56.820]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.180]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens,
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:02.080]   and supplementing with NAC, N-acetylcysteine,
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.140]   both of which can support glutathione production,
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.880]   and detoxification, and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.460]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.860]   is so important for health,
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.660]   and while I've been doing it for years,
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:15.580]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.060]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.960]   both at the level of ease of use,
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.500]   that is getting the tests done,
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.220]   as well as how comprehensive,
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.580]   and how actionable the tests are,
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.820]   that I recently joined their advisory board,
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.060]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.380]   If you'd like to try Function,
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:33.660]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:37.260]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.860]   but they're offering early access
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.100]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:43.380]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman,
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.940]   to get early access to Function.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.820]   As I recall in your book, "Right Brain Psychotherapy,"
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.260]   there was a description, beautiful description,
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.980]   of these up states,
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.140]   and then these more calming state coordination
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.220]   between mother and child.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:59.140]   And I started to,
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:03.020]   I actually read this book when I was living in Topanga,
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.380]   I would walk on the road,
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.420]   I don't recommend this, there are no sidewalks in Topanga,
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:08.380]   and I would read the physical copy,
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.700]   and I recall very distinctly,
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:14.600]   thinking about this image of the baby and the mother,
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:18.560]   and the baby is a little bit hyper aroused, is upset,
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:22.400]   and so the mother would make sort of sounds,
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.300]   not necessarily words, like, "Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,"
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:26.140]   these kinds of things,
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.340]   or humming, or- - Lullabies.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:30.460]   - Bouncing lullabies, these sorts of things.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:31.460]   - That's the prosody.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:32.380]   - That's the prosody.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:36.580]   And then the related release of things like serotonin,
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.940]   perhaps oxytocin as well.
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:39.400]   We can talk more about those.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.460]   But then also how critical it is
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.700]   for the mother to be able to regulate
[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:46.080]   the baby's transition to up states,
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.000]   like looking at the baby as it comes out of a nap,
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.380]   and saying, "Good morning,"
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:53.060]   and really wide eyes, lots of gesturing,
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.740]   lots of gesticulating, that is,
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.220]   you know, bringing the voice level up,
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:59.900]   and the baby going, you know, really waking up
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.980]   in a kind of a steeper slope of arousal,
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.360]   and how important that was,
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.540]   and then that being slightly more related,
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.940]   and this makes perfect sense,
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:12.940]   to norepinephrine, adrenaline at low healthy levels,
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.660]   and perhaps dopamine as well.
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:16.780]   Is that the right way to think about this?
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.620]   And if so, is that what's going on
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:22.420]   when we form adult friendships, adult relationships?
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.380]   Are we oscillating back and forth
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.940]   between the ability to hang out,
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:29.220]   and relax, and soothe each other,
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:32.540]   and the ability to kind of get excited about something?
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:36.300]   Is this the basis of all relationships and relating?
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.660]   - Yes, yes.
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:41.380]   The key here is emotional regulation, again,
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.680]   and again, it's implicit emotional regulation.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:49.140]   One of the tenets, central tenets of my ideas here,
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:52.100]   is that, first of all,
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.860]   there has been too much of an emphasis
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:56.260]   on the down-regulation of negative states.
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:57.860]   You remember the original attachment theory,
[00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:59.700]   the secure base, the baby would come back
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.060]   in a stressed state,
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:04.300]   she would down-regulate the negative states.
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.860]   But really, attachment is about
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.660]   the down-regulation of negative states,
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.660]   and the up-regulation of positive states.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.260]   Still, at this point in time,
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.380]   the importance of positive states
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:18.180]   in the human experience are overlooked.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:22.500]   Positive emotions, joy, enthusiasm, excitement.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.140]   Positive states literally are the key,
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.380]   and there are hormonal aspects to that,
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.420]   as you just point out.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.260]   For example, dopamine, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.820]   And this goes for therapy also.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.380]   In therapy, it's not only just the down-regulation
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.380]   and the sharing the down-regulation,
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:41.220]   but it's also sharing the up-regulation of positive states,
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:45.500]   because that's a critical piece of it also.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.060]   But there still is that bias, to look one way.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.180]   Now, in the "Right Brain" book,
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.540]   I'm also talking about two types of love.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:57.820]   Quiet love and excited love.
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.740]   This was the famous psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott,
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:03.860]   who was a pediatrician,
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:06.820]   who was one of the great psychoanalysts of the 20th century,
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:09.740]   and he made the distinction between quiet love,
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:14.100]   which would again be the down-regulation of noradrenaline,
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.100]   and excited, which is into a parasympathetic state,
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:19.820]   so you're going from a hypersympathetic state
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:23.060]   into a parasympathetic state, quiet love.
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:26.660]   And then excited love, which would be also passionate love,
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.900]   which is the high-arousal state out of it, so to speak.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.060]   And they are both important,
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.020]   and ultimately, they both need to be integrated.
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:38.660]   And you may have a situation whereby one can do one,
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.220]   but ultimately, they have to come together.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.300]   Let me make this important point.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:47.740]   In the end, we have negative emotions for adaptive reasons.
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:49.020]   It's there.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.420]   Let's say shame.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:54.740]   Shame is meant to dose down very high levels of arousal.
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:59.220]   And if one can't do that, very high levels of arousal,
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.940]   let's say in narcissistic personality disorders,
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.220]   you need to be able to...
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.580]   So we need to have access
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:07.020]   to both positive and negative emotion.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:10.420]   But the real key to a secure attachment
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.860]   is the ability to integrate
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.380]   both positive and negative emotions.
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:20.660]   So with a really good, securely attaching mother,
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.500]   when that baby is in a down state,
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.140]   literally, she can literally ride down with that baby
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.380]   and synchronize.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.980]   And when it's an upstate,
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.660]   she can really ride up with that state.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.060]   In the case of narcissistic personality disorders,
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.540]   let's say, for example, and I'm jumping here,
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.860]   we've got an insecure attachment.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.580]   It can be an avoidant attachment,
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.420]   or the other one, depends on what kind.
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:43.380]   There are two different types
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.020]   of narcissistic personality disorders.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.860]   - You can have anxiously attached narcissistic?
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.380]   - No, no, but you can have two different types
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.620]   of narcissistic personality disorders.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:53.780]   A vulnerable attachment and an egotistical attachment.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.620]   - You said a vulnerable attachment?
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:59.540]   - Vulnerable attachment is, again, an anxious attachment.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.860]   - These people constantly need praise?
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.580]   - Yeah, yes.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:07.580]   Sound familiar, but also egotistical attachment.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:10.420]   But my point out of that, essentially here,
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.140]   is the stresses in life are there,
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.500]   and that the negative stresses are there,
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.340]   but we can learn from those negative stresses also, et cetera.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.820]   And ultimately, what we need to do
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.660]   is to be able to know how to integrate.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:28.540]   If we can't integrate the positive and the negative,
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:32.700]   we'll end up with splitting, you know the term.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:36.980]   - Because I believe that's a primary feature
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.500]   of borderline personality disorder.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.340]   - Yes.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.300]   - Which I think we should also touch on.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.300]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.260]   - So my understanding about splitting
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:49.020]   is that it's the I love you, I hate you phenomenon
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:53.380]   brought on by not just an internal switch,
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:57.660]   which is sometimes seen in bipolar disorder,
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:01.060]   but rather somebody with a borderline personality disorder
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:05.540]   will see something and be very upset.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.140]   Suddenly, the fact that a glass is empty of a drink
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.460]   meant that they didn't think enough
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.820]   to like refill a glass or something,
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:15.820]   whereas a few minutes before, it was perfectly fine.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.140]   It was not an issue, right?
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.260]   There needs to be a trigger, and then they split.
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.100]   Is that right?
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:20.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.540]   So essentially, you know, the splitting usually,
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.780]   the splitting goes out externally.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:29.060]   That person is all bad, I am all good.
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:32.460]   So now you have that splitting, et cetera.
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.940]   You can't see anything of the goodness in that person
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.780]   at this point in time.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:36.780]   - Does it sometimes go the other way?
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.540]   That person's all good, I'm bad?
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.820]   - Could also be that, all good.
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.540]   But you also have internally splitting.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:42.900]   You have an internal split
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.820]   between a good self and a bad self.
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.580]   And internally, there's an internal object relationship
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.620]   that we all have as we internalize
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.820]   these external relationships
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.740]   so that there's a good self and a bad self, literally,
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:58.580]   and that they cannot be integrated, so to speak.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:02.620]   And that that part of me, I hate that part of me
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.020]   versus I love that part of me.
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:07.100]   Or in terms of borderline,
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:09.460]   usually what you see at the very beginning
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.020]   is that there's an over-idealization
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.700]   of the positive values of that therapist.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:20.460]   And then there are some stressors and misattunements
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.580]   and ruptures that aren't repair.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.860]   And now all of a sudden,
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:27.060]   what was totally good now becomes totally bad.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.020]   Incidentally, that could be,
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.740]   if there was not a strong therapeutic alliance,
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.420]   the point at which the person will drop out.
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:38.140]   - Are these people with borderline personality,
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:39.980]   I don't know if you still call it a disorder.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.500]   Nowadays, it gets a little bit into the,
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:46.140]   let's call it borderline with borderline.
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:50.820]   Do they exhibit the same sort of splitting idealization
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.860]   and then the idea that somebody is terrible
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:54.040]   and they want nothing to do with them
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.300]   in the context of work relationships, friendships?
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.940]   Does it extend out into other domains of life
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:03.540]   or is it unique to certain types of relationships?
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.820]   - I think it's a way of seeing the world.
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.940]   Remember, and the way of seeing the world essentially
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:11.500]   is very different from the left hemisphere
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.340]   and the right hemisphere.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.300]   The right hemisphere sees the world
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.300]   through emotional relationships.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:19.180]   And that, so that can become a trait
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.980]   that can be really a hard and fast trait.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:23.380]   Let me put it another way.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:27.800]   In the case of narcissistic personality disorder,
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.940]   the baby is all good.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:36.100]   The caregiver, primary caregiver,
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:40.800]   is always thinking very positive about that infant.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.460]   But when that infant now all of a sudden becomes depressed,
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:49.660]   the interactive regulation stops at that point in time.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.980]   - The caregiver doesn't want anything to do with them.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.820]   - So at that point in time, now,
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:58.380]   everything is unconscious.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.340]   If you and I are together
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.540]   and there is a misattunement between us,
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:08.960]   what possibility, let's say in a dismissive attachment,
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.980]   is all of a sudden I will disengage?
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:15.600]   We got too close.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.880]   And at that point in time,
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.700]   maybe I'm acting out my early attachment dynamics
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.400]   because what the baby is doing
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.760]   is expecting what the mother will do next.
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:32.040]   And at that point in time,
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.960]   there's a misattunement like that.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.920]   And so in the case of a dismissive personality,
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:41.280]   that person will emotionally disengage, okay?
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.360]   Become very abstract at that point in time.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:49.200]   And at that point in time, I can't feel you.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.600]   I hear what you're saying.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.280]   And so at all points in time,
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.440]   you have this situation of coming closer and moving apart,
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.120]   coming closer and moving apart.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.520]   And this will be acted out
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.180]   in the therapeutic relationship also.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:08.040]   And so that every time the person is,
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.520]   the anxious person is stressed,
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.880]   they'll come in closer to you now.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.040]   Now, they're more demanding about what they need from you.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.840]   Look at the tone of my voice.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.680]   Well, the insecure avoidant now
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.280]   is now gonna deactivate it.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.700]   And at that point in time, my voice will now get flat.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.620]   You can't even hear the affective tone of my voice.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.840]   So I'm telling you that we always pick up
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:35.000]   at the level of our own physiology,
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.480]   how emotionally close or distant
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.680]   that person is at this point in time,
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.120]   especially at points of stress,
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.040]   whether I'm coming in or I'm moving out.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.520]   Let me go back to this.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.740]   All of this is occurring at an implicit level,
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:57.800]   which is why you said something about reparenting, et cetera.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:02.160]   Too much is on a conscious level there.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:06.800]   If you really want to make these changes in a personality,
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.680]   they have to be changes in the right brain.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:14.140]   And that's why all therapy now is looking into emotion.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:18.260]   All therapy, no matter what form of therapy,
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.720]   it's laying on top of the therapeutic relationship
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.060]   and emotion per se.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.940]   - I'm pausing 'cause I'm just taking all this in
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:31.620]   and thinking about what are the ways
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:36.620]   that people can start to tap into this right brain health
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:40.980]   or lack of health and ways to repair
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:43.900]   their right brain circuitry, so to speak,
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:51.740]   without a therapist, or is that just simply impossible?
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:54.360]   - No, it's not impossible, no, it's not impossible.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.080]   We all do grow, and incidentally,
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.760]   our right brains do grow.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.760]   But again, the key here, I'm suggesting,
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:10.900]   the whole idea about interpersonal neurobiology,
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.760]   it was the editor of the Northern Syria,
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:17.360]   interpersonal, which is the two-person situation.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.120]   There has been too much of an emphasis on order regulation
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.800]   and not enough emphasis on interactive regulation.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.720]   The real key to changing a right brain
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:32.260]   is finding people you can be close with,
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.940]   finding people you can be open with,
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.840]   finding people you can be vulnerable with,
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.920]   that literally you can show your shortcomings,
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.880]   and opening yourself up to those people
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.360]   as they open up to you.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.920]   It's literally to form that right brain to right brain
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.120]   communication system with someone else.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.580]   - I think I just got it.
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.440]   I think, if I'm not mistaken,
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.560]   what you're describing is interactive dynamics
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:06.800]   that create or elaborate on circuitry
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.880]   that exists in all of us,
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.440]   but that for some people might be atrophied
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.080]   because of the lack of proper nourishment,
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.380]   emotional nourishment early in life,
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:19.640]   but that we can engage these circuits,
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.040]   these right brain circuits.
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.280]   But then when we're not around these people,
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.500]   there must be something about the right brain circuitry
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:30.080]   that provides a sort of a soothing function
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.360]   so that we must know at an implicit level
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.800]   that we can do this.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.240]   We know how to attach in healthy ways to people.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.360]   We have a close friend we can rely on.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.320]   We have maybe friends, plural.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.860]   We maybe repaired a relationship with a sibling,
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:45.700]   this kind of thing.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.880]   So it's not that these circuits need to constantly
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.560]   be engaged every moment with the barista,
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.640]   with the, you know. - No, no.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.840]   - But that we somehow at an unconscious level,
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.680]   it must be that we come to realize
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.000]   that this circuitry has re-elaborated
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.320]   or is elaborated in a way that we know,
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.760]   quote unquote, we can do it.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.300]   - You know, remember, part of the problem
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:11.660]   is being able to take in, to take these things in here.
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.880]   But the key to emotion, incidentally,
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.040]   let me throw out an important,
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.800]   another important term in terms of a therapy situation.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.440]   I've said essentially therapy is about
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.120]   literally reworking emotion.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.880]   And the key to mental health and physical health
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.760]   is also a right brain emotional situation here.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.140]   The key here is that there are heightened
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:40.560]   affective moments in a therapy session.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.400]   I'm gonna go therapy,
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.440]   then I'm gonna come back to your question.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.800]   We've now formed a therapeutic alliance.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.280]   The stronger the therapeutic alliance is between us,
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.240]   more empathy between us, so to speak,
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.620]   the more we can share.
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:58.720]   I'm now going to start to drop some of my defenses
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.880]   because the defenses are there to block affect,
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.240]   negative affect, and begin now to take a chance now
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.120]   to open myself up, you know, to somebody else's.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.600]   But in a therapy session,
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.480]   somewhere around the middle of that session,
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:16.480]   a person comes in out of the world in a left brain state,
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:19.380]   somewhere in the middle of the session,
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.960]   they start moving into affect.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.360]   And now the person is starting to talk
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.160]   in a more affective level.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.440]   And now talking about a memory or some sad situation
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.640]   or something that just happened
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.520]   in a relationship with a couple.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.380]   Now, you even start hearing my voices now.
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.420]   The voice tone change.
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:40.800]   And these moments, which only may last,
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:45.200]   believe it or not, 50, 60 seconds,
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.880]   are heightened affective moments.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.720]   These are moments when all of a sudden
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.320]   we are both in the right and we are both synchronized.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.180]   And the affective now is out there, so to speak.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.400]   And that's the possibility now to get this change
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.240]   in these heightened affective moments.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.240]   So to be in an interpersonal relationship with someone
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.240]   and to co-create with that person,
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.580]   a heightened affective moment in both of us,
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:16.160]   which we are sharing at that point in time,
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.200]   by taking the risk to be open at that point in time also.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.400]   These are the moments in life
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.600]   that you really go into your autobiographical memory.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.560]   I remember my occasion with that person.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.840]   I can bring back the whole context
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.960]   because remember the right brain acts with images, images.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.120]   So I can bring back that image now.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.760]   And I can remember the closeness that I felt
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.240]   at that point in time, et cetera.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.600]   These are put into right brain.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.240]   So we are always putting into our autobiographical memory
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.080]   these heightened affective moments.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.080]   So to have those shared affective moments with other people,
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:01.560]   these are really whereby you're making changes in the right.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:05.040]   And these are much more important, I want to suggest,
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.880]   than intellectually.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.440]   Now, there have been certain fMRI,
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.360]   I'm now gonna move into a little bit
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.020]   of a different place here.
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.980]   What I'm suggesting is that these right brain
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.000]   to right brain communications are always going on.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.600]   But certain people literally can't read them
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.400]   as well as other people can.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.340]   And they can't read the face of voice.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:31.320]   And they can't synchronize well.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.760]   - Can I stop you and ask one question,
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.320]   which is, let's say that,
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.200]   let's take this conversation, for instance.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.920]   I'm listening to your words very carefully.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.960]   If I make an effort to listen especially carefully
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.080]   to what somebody is saying, the content of their words,
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.720]   is there a competition between left and right brain
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.080]   such that I'm now not getting
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.940]   as much right brain listening?
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.140]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:59.440]   - This to me feels like the surrender aspect.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.780]   Whereas I can, and I do this during these interviews
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:06.620]   slash discussions, where I'll sit back sometimes,
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.640]   and I'm still listening, but I widen my gaze.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.500]   I don't look around, but I widen my gaze.
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.740]   And I'm trying to just feel something coming in.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.020]   I'm not a therapist, obviously.
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.940]   No one would ever suspect that I was.
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.540]   But I only do it for a few seconds.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.560]   And then I re-engage.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:27.300]   And I used to think that it was like a relaxation of sorts.
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:32.180]   But inevitably, I feel like it's a different way
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:35.500]   to, the conversation takes a different direction.
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.080]   Is that more or less what you're talking about?
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.420]   - Yeah, that's a colossal shift.
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:40.980]   I mean, Stanley, the corpus callosum,
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:42.780]   you can shift from the left into the right
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:44.780]   in about 100 milliseconds.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.360]   So essentially, you can't be in,
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.660]   you have to be in one hemisphere or the other.
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.300]   - So if I'm listening very carefully
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.180]   to exactly what you said,
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.920]   and I'm tracking everything you said,
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.660]   like we're in a courtroom situation,
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.860]   then my right brain is suppressed.
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:16:59.700]   - Okay.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:00.520]   - Is that right?
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.360]   - Good feet, good feet.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.460]   - Now watch where I go here.
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.720]   - Okay.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:08.420]   - The right hemisphere is dominant for attention, okay?
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:10.220]   I mean, this baby and this mother,
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.620]   literally, she's focusing our attention
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.700]   on that baby's face tone voice.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.020]   But there are two different types of attention,
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:19.860]   strong neuroscience to show this.
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:23.420]   The left brain operates by narrow attention,
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.360]   narrowly focused attention.
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.660]   The best example of narrowly focused attention
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:33.140]   is you are following my words one after the other.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.000]   But there's another type of attention
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.060]   which is used by the right brain,
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:39.940]   which is called wide ranging attention,
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:43.380]   which comes right out of Freud,
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:44.700]   which he also called,
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:48.060]   maybe you'll remember this, evenly suspended attention.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.380]   - I haven't heard that, but that's beautiful.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.300]   - It's the same thing,
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.140]   which is much wider than that.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.820]   And that form of attention is the form of attention
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:58.080]   that the right brain has,
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.020]   because the attention at that point in time
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:06.020]   is not only of what's coming from the outside,
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:12.900]   but also attention to what's happening in the inside,
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:16.580]   my own inside, the changes in my own physiology
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:18.260]   at that point in time also.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.220]   So yes, there are these two different forms of attention.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:25.380]   And essentially, the only way someone
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:27.960]   who was just narrow all the time,
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.440]   let's take a personality
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.560]   who just lives in the left hemisphere.
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.160]   - A hyper linear person.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.600]   - Exactly, hyper logical, hyper rational,
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.160]   cannot really see the big picture,
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.540]   but literally that kind of a situation.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:45.160]   So essentially, that kind of a person
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.800]   is always looking at the narrow aspects of it,
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:52.420]   and cannot see the broader context,
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.800]   the broader context,
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.500]   because there's a context that's being set up.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.620]   Right now, between you and I,
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:01.360]   there's also a context that's being set up.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:04.280]   And that context also has to it
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.820]   a kind of a feeling of safety and trust
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:11.780]   as we literally just go off wherever our thoughts are,
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:14.620]   with some idea that literally you will be able to follow
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:17.100]   that and you'll come back with me at the same time.
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:22.100]   So the context, the emotional atmosphere between us
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:25.960]   changes when you go left into the right like that.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.520]   Point here is that it used to be thought
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.640]   that the only way you could understand the brain
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:37.680]   was by looking more intra-psychically into one brain.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.080]   If you understood how one brain worked,
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.260]   and everything was intra-psychic,
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:44.720]   but then there's the interpersonal part of it.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.000]   And so essentially, we're moving now
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.440]   from a one-person intra-psychic psychology
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.880]   to a two-person interpersonal psychology.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.240]   You see what I mean by two-person?
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.760]   I got the mother here, got the baby there.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:58.400]   I got the patient here, I got the therapist there.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:01.160]   And between them literally are going back and forth
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.320]   at all periods of time,
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.340]   right brain to right brain communications
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.800]   underneath the conversation.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.840]   So neuroimaging, hyperscanning,
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.980]   neuroimaging, you're familiar with hyperscanning,
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:15.440]   another paradigm shifting thing
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.820]   that is occurring now in neuroimaging.
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:21.940]   For the first time, we can now scan two people,
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:24.340]   NIRS, EEG, whatever you want,
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:26.140]   while they are in the middle
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:28.860]   of a basic interpersonal interaction,
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:31.840]   a numberable interaction between the two of them.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.840]   These studies have now been done.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.020]   And what they did was that they found
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.280]   is that the two brains,
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:44.460]   especially when they're into emotional states,
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:47.340]   and when they are looking at each other face-to-face,
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:49.100]   and they're concentrating literally
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:52.820]   on how to empathically be with that person, et cetera,
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.580]   emotions, so to speak,
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:57.620]   they find that the right brain of one
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:00.380]   will synchronize with the right brain of the other.
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:03.460]   And the part of the right brain
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.340]   that synchronizes with the other
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:09.580]   is the right temporal parietal junction.
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:14.380]   A lot of evidence now
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:17.000]   on the right temporal parietal junction.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.400]   I said right brain to right brain.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:24.000]   So now, the eyes are coming.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.080]   And remember, the eyes are,
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.760]   I mean, direct eye connection
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.160]   really is the most powerful form of communication.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.320]   - I always remind people,
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.760]   these are two little bits of brain
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.120]   outside your cranial vault.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.360]   As weird as that might seem,
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.480]   they are two bits of brain.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.160]   Your retina is central nervous system,
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.320]   and you're looking at,
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.480]   that's about as close as you can get
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.680]   to looking at somebody's brain state as anything.
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:46.000]   - Well, you know, the eyes are being controlled
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.280]   by the autonomic nervous system.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.120]   So you got the,
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.640]   you have an autonomic nervous system
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.000]   with an autonomic nervous system synchrony here,
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:52.840]   so to speak.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:57.520]   But essentially, what's occurring at this point in time,
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.620]   face, voice, gesture.
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:04.000]   The face is processed in the posterior parts
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.920]   of the right hemisphere, the face processing.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.640]   Right hemisphere, face processing.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.880]   The posterior parts of the right hemisphere,
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.120]   the sensory areas of the right hemisphere,
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.400]   process the voice.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.260]   The melody of the voice, the tone of the voice.
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.160]   That's different than the semantics of the voice.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.200]   - So this is prosody.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.080]   This is what the Italians do so well.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.120]   - Right, right.
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:30.880]   And the posterior parts of the right hemisphere
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:35.520]   also will process gesture and tactile, okay?
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:38.440]   All of that comes together,
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.120]   is integrated together
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.800]   in the right temporal parietal junction.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.440]   So when two people literally
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.800]   are empathically synchronizing with each other,
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.980]   when we are sharing the same emotional state,
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:56.640]   the patient says at this point in time,
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:59.060]   "My God, it's rage.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:01.240]   "I never realized it was anger."
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.900]   And at that point in time,
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:08.480]   the empathic therapist who is synchronizing,
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.440]   we are both literally now
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.720]   in that right temporal parietal junction.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.920]   But the right temporal parietal junction
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.660]   is what sends the communications
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.720]   and receives the communications.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.540]   Got me here?
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:27.540]   So essentially, that's where our linkage is
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:29.920]   and we are now literally in a right brain
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.200]   to right brain communication.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.000]   And what they found was
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.360]   during a real psychotherapy situation
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.580]   where the patient comes in and they're there
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:43.700]   because they have interpersonal relationships problems
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.560]   and emotional problems,
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.280]   and they're face-to-face and they're eye-to-eye,
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:50.960]   and they're tracking each other's like that,
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.740]   you will find that synchronization.
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:57.960]   So the synchronization between my right temporal parietal
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.360]   and your right temporal parietal
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:03.200]   is a right brain to right brain communication.
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.660]   That right brain to right brain communication
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:08.880]   is always occurring in that kind of a context.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:13.600]   And therefore, the most important new change
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.020]   in psychoanalysis is that the unconscious
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:21.660]   just is more than just happening at dreams.
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:24.000]   It's happening at all points
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.040]   because the unconscious we now know
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.280]   is a relational unconscious.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.580]   It communicates with another relational unconscious,
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:34.920]   right brain to right brain.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.240]   And this has really changed so much now
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.720]   in our understanding about what psychotherapy
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.120]   is about also.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.400]   Incidentally, I wanna point out
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:47.900]   the major change mechanism in psychotherapy now
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:50.680]   is not insight, it's not cognitive insight.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.440]   It's more the ability to have
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.040]   an emotionally laden conversation
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.440]   with another human being
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.080]   and to make emotional connections
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.480]   with another human being,
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.080]   which is why the therapeutic relationship really
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.840]   is the factor of the change.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.560]   And that's very different than the old days
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.360]   was your unconscious is here,
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.600]   the analyst is there.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.300]   I'm now going to interpret what you're doing
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:17.080]   as you are sinking down into the right.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.200]   But I'm gonna stay up left and interpret it.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.760]   That's why there was a real limitation to that.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:25.080]   And that's why psychoanalysis really changed now also
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.400]   to a face-to-face contact,
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.620]   not just the couch also.
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:33.000]   - Fascinating and makes total sense
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.320]   based on the newer imaging tools,
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.880]   revealing synchrony, et cetera.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.580]   I have two questions that can be asked in parallel,
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:46.100]   music and dogs.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.500]   Why music and dogs?
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.120]   Well, some of what you're describing
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.520]   reminds me of the state shift that occurs
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.760]   when I hear particular pieces of music
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.340]   for which I'm not paying attention to the lyrics
[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:05.800]   or in some cases the lyrics matter.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.800]   I'm listening, but they don't make any sense.
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.600]   Like if they were read out as a paragraph,
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.220]   it wouldn't make any sense,
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:14.400]   but it feels like there's some fundamental truth there.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.360]   So this is, I could state specific musical preferences,
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:19.480]   but it's highly individual.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:20.880]   So for some people, it's classical music,
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.780]   for other people, it's music that contains lyrics,
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:26.400]   but there's this feeling like, yes,
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.000]   like there's a truth there.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.480]   And I feel that truth,
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.640]   even though the content of the words,
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.080]   let's take, couldn't help myself,
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:34.680]   like a Bob Dylan song, for instance,
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.500]   he's certainly could be considered a poet, right?
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.840]   You know, and if you read the lyrics just as a paragraph,
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.400]   you'd be like, this is nonsense,
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.580]   but the way that it's sung, the meaning behind it,
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:46.800]   the timbre in the voice, the prosody, et cetera,
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.740]   and presumably the emotion that he was feeling
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.600]   at the time when the music was recorded
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.080]   communicates with us and we enter a synchronous state.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.160]   And then in parallel to this,
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:59.160]   I mentioned dogs where, sure,
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.840]   they have a left brain and a right brain,
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.400]   but I think with animals generally,
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.520]   if they're domestic animals
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.880]   and we have a very close relationship to them,
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.000]   we can really feel a resonance with them
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.080]   and presumably them with us.
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.360]   And for anyone that's experienced it,
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.440]   some people might be chuckling now,
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.680]   but it's nothing short of profound, right?
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.160]   The extent to which we really feel like they see us
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.640]   and we see them and there's a bond.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.240]   Clearly not the same magnitude as a parent-child bond,
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.580]   but nonetheless.
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:32.380]   So music and dogs, do you think it's tapping in
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:36.440]   to this same right temporal parietal structure?
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:40.200]   - Well, I think that it's, first of all,
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.040]   the right temporal parietal junction is the posterior
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.640]   and the right orbital frontal is the cortex.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.400]   So the whole right brain there, so to speak.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.240]   - Okay, so we're going,
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.000]   we're basically going from anterior to posterior,
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]   just their structure's the whole way back.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.340]   - The orbital frontal is the regulation part of it.
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:58.520]   The temporal parietal junction
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.880]   is the communication part of it.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:02.200]   So the whole key is the communication of emotion
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:03.600]   and the regulation of emotion.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.560]   - Where is the surrender switch?
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.600]   - The surrender is the colossal switch
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.920]   out of the left into the right.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:11.520]   - So not so much paying attention
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.880]   to the content of the words, the logic behind them,
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.320]   the logical flaws that might exist, the analytic part,
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.520]   but rather how the words sound,
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:22.720]   how the words feel, literally.
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:26.660]   - Yes, and clearly one of the, first of all,
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:29.900]   there has been a lot of neuroscience done on music
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:32.460]   and incidentally, most of that is right brain,
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:35.740]   showing right brain activation in music.
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:38.660]   The key here, even more than that,
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:43.160]   it's particular music to me.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.100]   It has a particular meaning to me, subjectivity.
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:51.780]   And a lot shows that music is essentially a mechanism
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:53.140]   of affect regulation.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.140]   But I wanna suggest to you that pets
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:58.740]   are also a mechanism of affect regulation.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:28:59.860]   - Dogs everywhere smiling.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:03.300]   - Absolutely, but maybe by the same things,
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:05.460]   I wanna suggest, I think that the communication
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:08.420]   between dogs, and I've had four dogs myself,
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:11.180]   is that literally it's tactile,
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:13.660]   it's the touch of that animal,
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:15.300]   it's the prosody of the voice,
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:17.860]   because literally that dog understands
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:19.740]   the prosody of the voice.
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:24.740]   And also, to some extent, I think they can read our faces.
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:28.220]   But more than that, there's one other sense
[01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:29.260]   which I haven't brought up,
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:33.180]   which is part of human relationship, and that's smell.
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:36.020]   Okay, and this is overlooked in human relationship.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:39.100]   But in real intimate contacts between human beings,
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:41.260]   the smell is really a key there.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:42.860]   You know, think about sexual arousal.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:47.020]   So dogs are really very strong on our smell, et cetera.
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:51.820]   But if attachment is reunion after a separation,
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:56.700]   you come home, there's that dog sitting there, literally,
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:59.940]   and immediately you're down-regulating the day.
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:02.380]   You have now taken off the whole left hemisphere
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.220]   and our whole stresses of all of that,
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:07.260]   and you're now shifting left into right,
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:10.740]   and we use the mechanisms that is available to do that.
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:13.180]   And music is one of the ways to do that.
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:16.180]   So in some sense, music is an auto-regulation,
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:18.700]   although music can be live music,
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:19.860]   and then it's more than that.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:21.020]   So that's the case.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:22.460]   - Or playing music with others.
[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:23.820]   This is something I'm incapable of
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.540]   because I have no musical ability.
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:26.740]   But playing music with others,
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:30.260]   you can see that when we talk about the chemistry of a band,
[01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:32.500]   it's so incredible to witness that,
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.540]   and then to feel it in mass
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:36.620]   with thousands maybe of other people.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:40.360]   - Yeah, there have been studies to show
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:42.900]   that during a performance,
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:47.940]   there is a synchrony, there are synchronized states
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:51.100]   between the performer and the audience.
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:52.740]   And it's really, they're all,
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.260]   you can have thousands of people
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:56.300]   literally in that same synchronized state
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:57.780]   at that point in time here.
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:01.740]   - You mentioned earlier Steven Porges' work,
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.820]   and we know that brain and body
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:05.620]   are connected in both directions.
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:08.420]   And I should know this, but I don't know
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:13.060]   if the right brain has preferential communication
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:16.520]   with the parasympathetic or sympathetic
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:19.700]   or other aspects of, well, Vegas is parasympathetic,
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:20.980]   but I think it's probably both.
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:23.780]   I think the more we discover about the Vegas,
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:26.180]   it's likely to be mixed sympathetic, parasympathetic,
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.180]   but I'll catch some heat for that, but that's okay.
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:32.100]   But is the, bodily sensing is a real thing.
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:33.740]   Like there are ways that our diaphragm
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.780]   and our core relax when we're happy.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:39.340]   I mean, all of this is obvious to anyone,
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:41.700]   but I'm just curious how right brain
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:44.060]   links up with bodily states.
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:45.900]   - The right brain is more connected
[01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.720]   into the body than the left brain.
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.500]   Incidentally, I'm going to,
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.280]   do you know the name Ian McGilchrist?
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:55.580]   - Yes, I know the name and many people have commented
[01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:58.300]   on our YouTube channel that I need to talk to Ian.
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:03.660]   That's all, I have gotten that far, but I've been busy.
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:07.140]   - Get him, get him.
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:09.180]   - Great, Ian, we'll send you an invite.
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:10.360]   - Yeah, I mean,
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:17.060]   there has been ongoing dialogue between us for some time,
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:19.460]   but Ian talks about that the right brain
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:22.380]   literally is much more connected into the body
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:27.380]   and incidentally is also more dominant for will.
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:31.620]   Unconscious will is more important than conscious will,
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:33.260]   which you kind of, at the very beginning,
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:35.460]   we were talking about the left versus the right.
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:38.500]   - Yeah, so I'm curious as to, you know,
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:42.540]   how people can start to sense
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:44.900]   these right brain, left brain shifts.
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:48.300]   We talked about how paying a little less attention
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.820]   to the content of words and a little bit more
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:53.320]   to how a conversation is feeling,
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:58.060]   independent of the word content, might be part of it.
[01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:00.060]   We hear a lot these days about, you know,
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.920]   how body posture matters, you know,
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:05.220]   like if people are closed up with their arms crossed,
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:07.180]   I don't know, but sometimes I'm just a little chilly,
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:09.140]   so I'll cross my arms, and sometimes I'll cross my arms
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:12.180]   and lean in and I know that I'm in a much more attuned state.
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:13.740]   So I don't put too much weight on that,
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:16.420]   but maybe I should put more weight on that.
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:17.340]   And what are your thoughts?
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:22.340]   - Yeah, there's a classical work on by an analyst
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:24.540]   by the name of Manuel Hammer,
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:27.380]   and he was talking about how to reach the affect.
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.700]   And what he suggested is that there are certain moments
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:33.740]   of the session when literally my body,
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:37.100]   in order to pick up the communications of the patient,
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:38.660]   I lean back.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:41.240]   I'm not leaning forward, I lean back
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:45.020]   and let the atmosphere literally come over me, so to speak.
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.220]   - I love this, and I'm just, forgive me for interrupting,
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:50.700]   but I love this because people, especially on social media,
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:53.420]   they take a piece of information like, you know,
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.140]   if you're leaned back, you're disengaged,
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:56.300]   you're leaned forward, you're engaged,
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.260]   but you could also just turn it right around and say,
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:33:59.780]   if you're leaned forward, you're impending,
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:01.180]   and then the person doesn't have space.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:04.060]   And so it becomes, frankly, it becomes a bunch of BS.
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:05.660]   - But notice here what I'm talking about,
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:07.500]   what the therapist is attempting to do
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:11.220]   is to make an emotional connection, an empathic connection.
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:13.420]   And in order to make an empathic connection,
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:16.940]   you're leaning back, you're leaning back,
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:20.520]   and literally as you lean back, all of a sudden,
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.900]   you're able to pick up things and hear things
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:25.460]   that you didn't see before, so to speak.
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.740]   And frequently what happens when you're
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:29.840]   in an emotional connection like that,
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.460]   images will come to your mind,
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:35.320]   images which really represent the emotional experience
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.060]   that the other is having.
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:39.020]   And at that point in time also,
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.860]   what you'll find is that just as you're picking up
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:45.820]   that person's image, he's picking up your person image.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:49.940]   And what Hammer says is that what we have here
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:53.420]   is something that's like an affective wireless
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:56.660]   between the two, because it's going back and forth
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:34:59.740]   between the two of us, just like a right brain
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:02.780]   to right brain communication, affective.
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:07.780]   Freud said the human unconscious acts like a receptor
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:12.780]   and it picks up the communications of the unconscious
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:14.760]   of another human being.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:17.080]   Freud said literally human beings can pick up
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:22.040]   the unconscious without it going through the conscious mind.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.720]   So again, in that kind of a context,
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:28.040]   you know, that all makes sense.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:31.240]   The other thing I wanna say about all of these behaviors
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:32.700]   that are going on now when there is
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:34.120]   an emotional communication,
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:40.760]   the key is spontaneous behaviors, spontaneous,
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:44.420]   not thought out behaviors, spontaneous behaviors.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:47.920]   When there's spontaneous behaviors,
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:50.020]   there's more trust in them being, you know,
[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:52.140]   in the first place, but there's not a mind
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:54.140]   that is attempting to present anything.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:57.340]   And when you have two people revealing
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:00.420]   their spontaneous behaviors to each other,
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:03.160]   even if they're not sure how they're gonna be affected,
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:05.180]   that also is a matter for synchrony.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.260]   In order for there to be synchrony,
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:11.900]   there has to be spontaneous two-way communications,
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:13.600]   turn-taking communications.
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:17.660]   And incidentally, as we talk about this conversation,
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.400]   what is set up in the attachment
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.160]   between the mother and the infant,
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:24.820]   the infant makes a cry, the mother responds,
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:26.940]   is that they are now taking turns.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:29.500]   There's turn-taking behavior.
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.860]   And in a good relationship,
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:36.780]   what you find is more or less smooth turn-taking behaviors.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:40.220]   And incidentally, you and I, who have never met before,
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:42.140]   are not doing too badly
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:46.380]   in these spontaneous turn-taking behaviors between us.
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:47.540]   - I appreciate you saying that.
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:48.600]   I feel the same way.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.660]   Text messaging has become a dominant mode
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:54.260]   of communication these days.
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:59.400]   I've hosted a few guests expert in emotions in the brain,
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.620]   Lisa Feldman Barrett, for instance, and others.
[01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:07.060]   And she and others have talked about
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:10.500]   how the emojification of emotions,
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:12.180]   just like a smiley face or a crying face,
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:14.380]   or, "Oh, goodness," or, "You're mind-blown,"
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:16.020]   these things are convenient,
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:19.580]   as is shorthand text, lack of punctuation, et cetera.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:23.720]   But today's conversation also highlights the extent
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:27.220]   to which text messaging is pretty much devoid
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:29.220]   of most everything that you're talking about.
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:33.300]   A green bubble or a blue bubble, seen or not seen,
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:36.940]   read or not read, depending on how you set your settings.
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:40.780]   The latency, the turn-taking,
[01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:43.060]   sometimes people layer in multiple conversations
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:43.900]   and you're going back and forth
[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.080]   about a couple of different things,
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.460]   and then your food order comes.
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:52.100]   I mean, sure, the human brain can handle this,
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:55.120]   but this seems either not good,
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:59.500]   neutral, that is, or bad
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:03.300]   for building and reinforcing communication.
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:07.060]   It actually concerns me, but of course I'm now 49,
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:08.900]   so I can say things like, "Now that I'm 49,
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:10.300]   "I can say things like that," you know?
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:13.980]   But it concerns me because I think that you can imagine
[01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:16.980]   the young brain and the older brain
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:21.980]   essentially not being good at interpersonal dynamics.
[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:24.260]   Because of text messaging.
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:25.100]   - I agree.
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.380]   I agree.
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:30.320]   First of all,
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:36.300]   let me mention that one of Ian's ideas
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:40.100]   is that essentially the left hemisphere
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:42.160]   is becoming more and more dominant today,
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:45.260]   not only in this country,
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:48.060]   and that he sees that as really as a huge problem,
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:50.100]   because the title of his book is "The Master
[01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:52.260]   "and His Emissary," and the emissary,
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.940]   which is the left brain, betrays the master.
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:56.560]   So he sees that one of the problems
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.120]   we're dealing with right now
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.340]   is that the left hemisphere is there,
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:03.100]   and that these right hemispheres,
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:06.100]   even metaphors are problematic.
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:07.020]   - So I have a rule.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:09.080]   I don't argue over text.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:12.700]   I don't like to argue over text.
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:13.780]   I don't like to argue, period,
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:16.340]   but I don't, you know, I'll pick up the phone.
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:18.840]   I'm of the generation where we called one another.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.160]   I find text to be completely devoid
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:26.740]   of what I'm really seeking in terms of connection.
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:31.960]   And I think that there's an entire,
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.840]   I know there's an entire generation of people
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.580]   that grew up communicating mainly through short message.
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:41.800]   Jonathan Haidt, the author of "The Anxious Generation,"
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.440]   has been encouraging young kids to put away their phones
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.720]   and get out and interact more,
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.400]   encouraging parents to let their kids be more,
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.120]   what they call free-range kids, and do this kind of thing,
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:52.040]   arguing that there's far fewer dangers
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:52.880]   in the physical world
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.280]   than there are in the online world for young brains.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:57.840]   He makes a convincing argument.
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:03.800]   For those of us that are seeking to have better connection,
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:08.000]   maybe even do some healing of the right brain circuitry
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.680]   that you've been talking about today,
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:14.120]   do you think that there's a hierarchy of effectiveness
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:19.120]   such that text would be perhaps at the bottom,
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.640]   voice memo maybe next level up, I'm thinking here,
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.720]   phone call, there was a time
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.040]   when we wrote handwritten letters,
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:27.880]   and those felt very meaningful.
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:30.080]   I've kept handwritten letters from people
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.840]   that I cared about and that cared about me.
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:34.560]   The handwritten letters sort of proves
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:38.200]   that it doesn't have to be a real-time exchange,
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.200]   but there's something about handwriting.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.280]   A typewritten letter, by today's standards,
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:45.000]   would also be a significant thing,
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.640]   but there really seems to be something special
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:53.720]   about a letter, a face-to-face conversation.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.520]   - Right, in terms of literally the point of the letter,
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:01.240]   and the attempt of the letter literally
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.600]   was to make a connection.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.720]   I can remember in my childhood going away to camp,
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:09.040]   and we would write letters back and forth,
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.520]   and the words that were being used there
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:14.440]   were literally about making a connection
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.600]   and filling you in, which also meant
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.400]   that I had to reflect about myself
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.920]   and what was happening with me and how I felt about that,
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:25.920]   and I was sharing all of that with another person.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.720]   That has really gone into the background,
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.720]   and things have become much more impersonal,
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:34.400]   but I want to point out that for a certain type
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.720]   of personality, texting fits perfectly.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.000]   - These are people that walk around with left brains
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]   that are not hypertrophied?
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.640]   - People living in the left, living in the left,
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:48.480]   that's right.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:51.560]   I just want to point out, there are other ways,
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.240]   literally, of feeding the right brain of what it needs,
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:58.840]   and one of the other ways also is going out into the world,
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:01.800]   is traveling, is being in nature,
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:03.320]   sharing those kinds of things also.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:08.320]   Those are also in addition to the in-person situations here,
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:14.000]   but we're seeing changes here, we're seeing changes here,
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.880]   and I'm not so sure too many of these are good.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.280]   Let me throw out, I made a little list
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.240]   of the areas which are now being studied,
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:31.680]   which are showing that clearly this is right brain dominance
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:33.480]   in these activities.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.840]   - Please share.
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.040]   - Stop me at any point.
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:40.280]   Essentially, the argument that I'm making
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:42.880]   in this new book on human nature
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.720]   is that the highest levels of human nature
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:46.920]   are in the right brain.
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:51.600]   So essentially, intuition, now remember,
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:56.040]   intuition is there for all kinds of professions,
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:00.720]   that one of the things that a fireman gains over time
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.680]   is literally how to read a fire.
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.160]   So intuition, purely right brain,
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:08.960]   and intuition literally is drawing
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:12.200]   on body sensations also, et cetera.
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:17.200]   Imagery, creativity, a lot of evidence showing creativity,
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.720]   the ability to process things,
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:26.260]   something novel and something new, metaphors,
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.760]   imagination, studies, humor, music, poetry, art,
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:53.640]   morality, compassion, spirituality,
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.640]   and the best for last, love.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:06.360]   - That's a spectacular list,
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.880]   making the right brain circuitry
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:13.880]   at least among the most exciting circuits,
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.600]   certainly important circuits.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.280]   - I threw an ad for the next book.
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:22.120]   - I love right brain psychotherapy, love, love, love it.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.560]   I own a hardcover copy.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:26.840]   I've owned it for a couple of years now.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:28.000]   Highly recommend it.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.160]   We'll put links to your books in the show notes.
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:32.680]   - Get to development of the unconscious mind also.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:33.680]   - Okay, will do.
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:39.760]   What are some activities that allow us to,
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:43.200]   quote unquote, drop into our right brain circuitry
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.680]   a bit more?
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.640]   One that immediately leapt to mind,
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.160]   as you mentioned nature and interacting with nature,
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.980]   and we were talking about music, is walking.
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:58.720]   And earlier we talked about, you educated us on rather,
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:02.060]   this notion of wide range attention,
[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:07.600]   this evenly suspended attention
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.280]   that is associated with the right brain,
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:10.620]   this kind of widening of gaze
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:12.900]   as opposed to narrow gaze and narrow attention
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:15.200]   that is associated with left brain circuitry.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:20.080]   When we're out in nature and when we're ambulating,
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.760]   when we're walking,
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:24.360]   provided we're not looking at our phone, one hopes,
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:26.080]   or looking for something specific
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.960]   like a bird that we've spotted,
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:32.520]   we tend to be in panoramic vision.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.360]   I'm a vision scientist, so I can't help myself.
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.120]   You know, what we call magnocellular vision.
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:38.160]   These are like big pixels.
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.000]   - I'm aware.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:39.880]   - Yeah, taking it all in.
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:44.880]   And it's more spherical than kind of a cone of attention.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:50.240]   I would imagine that might be more right brain associated.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:53.240]   What are some things that you,
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:57.200]   if you suggest to your patients like,
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.120]   hey, you know, until our next session,
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.280]   you know, do you encourage them to journal,
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:03.240]   free associate journal, to listen to music,
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:05.220]   to take walks,
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:11.240]   or do you restrict the activation
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.840]   of this right brain circuitry to the session
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:15.200]   and then let it just show up as it were?
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.040]   - Yeah.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:16.880]   - Yeah.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.560]   So you let them sort of just default
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:20.480]   to what's happening.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:26.200]   Two points here.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:31.740]   First of all, on therapy,
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:36.080]   I think there's been too much of an emphasis
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:37.560]   on technique in therapy.
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:45.360]   And really what the right brain research is showing
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:51.240]   is that it's the right brain process
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:54.400]   that's the key here more than the technique.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:58.400]   And so that being the case,
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:46:59.520]   due to my own training,
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:02.880]   it's psychotherapy has shown to be more effective
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.120]   in making long-term changes
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:09.600]   and even changes after the treatment is over
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.800]   than other forms of therapy like CBT is.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.560]   So I think there's been too much on that.
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.480]   On the matter of other experiences,
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.440]   the right brain is also dominant
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:22.880]   for processing novel information.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.880]   Anytime something new comes up,
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:28.240]   the right picks it up first
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:31.440]   and you get a burst of more adrenaline out of that also.
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:36.440]   So the pursuit of continuing to have a curious mind,
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:38.300]   an open mind,
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:42.560]   I think is part of that.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:45.600]   And seeking new experiences
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.500]   in different parts of the world.
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:51.320]   There's an economic piece of that also,
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.760]   but with new challenges,
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:54.720]   bring up new challenges that we have
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:59.200]   and to essentially, if possible,
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:02.120]   feed curiosity.
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:03.140]   Curiosity.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:08.980]   Einstein even said something essentially
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:10.360]   along those lines there.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:13.080]   So new experiences with new people,
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:16.560]   new challenges, new places to see,
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:20.200]   travel, I think is one of those.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:24.080]   And it turned out to be one of the great fortunate gifts
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:25.680]   that came from all of this.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:31.720]   I was a therapist only for about 45 years
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:33.160]   and I came into this late.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.340]   I wrote this book late
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:40.340]   and literally it's led me into new relationships
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:41.480]   and new friends.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:44.520]   Who starts making friends at 45 and 50 years old?
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.080]   But again, novelties.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:51.080]   And sharing that, I think is also another way of doing that.
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:55.880]   Plus, you said this, I'll repeat it, exercise.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.820]   Exercise is a key here.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:03.440]   I happen to be interested in energy and in mitochondria
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:08.440]   and there's a scientist, Navio at San Diego,
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:11.100]   who has written on this
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:13.340]   and he's talking about the healing process.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:18.140]   And part of the healing process literally is exercise.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:21.900]   That's fundamental to healing of whatever,
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:25.820]   physical and mental, and also restorative sleep.
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:28.100]   So taking care of our body.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.120]   One of the things that we learn early in our experiences,
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:37.360]   mostly taught through the bodies,
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.480]   literally how to take care of our bodies.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:43.000]   And as you're all aware of, you don't see that
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.080]   in certain pathologies.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.880]   And you also have certain,
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:50.080]   and I'm talking about more than just self-destructive
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:51.000]   like cutting the butt.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.200]   Ultimately, the ability to be able to look inward
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:02.480]   and to be able to reflect back upon the self
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:08.540]   and to be able to see even what we wanna see
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:10.180]   and don't wanna see.
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:15.180]   Now, I wanna just make a quick reference to defenses
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:21.020]   because defenses can be adaptive and maladaptive
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:23.220]   and they're important and they're there.
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:26.340]   For example, we have defenses against overwhelming affect,
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:30.200]   the association is defense against overwhelming affect.
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:32.200]   But we also have defense like repression,
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:34.960]   which is part of all human beings.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.680]   And repression can be normal and adaptive
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:38.920]   or it can be maladaptive.
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:41.060]   And it's maladaptive literally
[01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:44.760]   when the repression is very strong, essentially.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:47.320]   What you have there is that the left hemisphere
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:50.520]   is just shutting out anything coming over from the right.
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.680]   That's what repression is.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:54.340]   The left hemisphere is just shutting that all out.
[01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:57.720]   So part of this is becoming more aware of those defenses
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:58.680]   that we have also.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:00.520]   And I wanna make this point also.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:06.320]   There are certain parts of ourselves which we cannot see.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:10.920]   We can only see them when we're getting feedback
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:15.920]   from somebody who knows us and can see those things in us.
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:19.560]   And even if at the time they're uncomfortable,
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:22.320]   but we need that feedback from somebody we trust
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:23.720]   to be able to see.
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:25.600]   Which is why this ability literally
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.080]   to completely change one's psychology
[01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:30.480]   is highly problematic.
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:32.280]   Because remember what you're attempting to do
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:34.920]   is to change the right brain.
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:39.260]   Which is why intimate relationships, close relationships
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:45.720]   with whom we can share things is really a key there also.
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.440]   Everybody has blind spots.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:54.320]   And the way out of that again is trusting enough
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:52:00.800]   to take in negative feedback at times also.
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:05.800]   My own feeling is that when something hits me,
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:07.980]   let's say a disappointment hits me.
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:13.460]   And one of the things I learned early about my own emotion,
[01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:15.800]   because in order to study emotion,
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.900]   you have to study your own emotion, et cetera.
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:23.040]   That for me, literally when something comes,
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:27.120]   I just let it come and move wherever it's gonna go.
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:30.760]   And feel it just at all of its intensity and strength.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.840]   And even after sharing it,
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:37.120]   literally letting it penetrate down so to speak.
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:40.200]   And ultimately at some point it'll come back
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:41.920]   into another shape and a form.
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:44.520]   But our emotions are adaptive.
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:47.840]   And again I want to point out one of the major fallacies
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.960]   is that negative emotions are bad
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:53.000]   and positive emotions are good.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.680]   Positive emotions are good, manic emotions, et cetera.
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:58.560]   Negative emotions are bad.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.480]   Losses, you know.
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:02.780]   We are wired for all of these emotions
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:04.760]   because they have adaptive value.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:07.160]   And we need to be able to be familiar
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:09.840]   with all of those different types of emotions.
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:14.200]   You know, that come our way in our lives.
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:17.000]   - I have a friend, he's a songwriter.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.240]   And he told me that he has this process
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:23.320]   whereby he writes music every day.
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:27.480]   But he starts his day by painting or drawing.
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:30.840]   And I think he's sold some paintings and drawings,
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:33.320]   but that's not his main vocation.
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:36.200]   But he told me that he draws and paints
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:41.200]   as a way to sort of grease the gears to songwriting.
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:44.360]   And then I learned that Joni Mitchell did this too,
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:45.500]   or something similar.
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:49.560]   And I can't help but wonder whether or not
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:52.960]   they've unconsciously tapped into a mode
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:54.760]   of bringing right brain circuitry up
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.140]   in terms of its activity.
[01:53:56.140 --> 01:54:01.600]   Neither of them are known as painters or artists,
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:02.960]   but of course musical artists
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:04.880]   and quite accomplished ones at that.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:09.940]   Does that sort of tool or technique make sense?
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:10.780]   - Yeah, it does.
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:12.620]   Essentially it's creativity, you know,
[01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:15.000]   which again is the ability to see something novel
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.960]   in a new way.
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.080]   To look at the same thing, but through new eyes.
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:22.400]   So I think those are ways of literally,
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:26.880]   artists know literally how to surrender out of the left
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:27.880]   and get into the right.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:30.720]   And you're seeing these mechanisms of surrender.
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:33.160]   But let me share into something else more autobiographical
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:35.120]   about what you're saying.
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:39.040]   When I decided to, I knew that I was gonna write something,
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.820]   you know, at a certain point in time.
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:45.800]   And so for 10 years, I went into a period of self-study.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:50.360]   And literally I went to a library, Cal State library near me
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:51.980]   and I just went through the stacks.
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:53.860]   You remember what it was like to go through the stacks?
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:54.860]   - I do. - And I started to move
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:58.580]   into psychology, into neurology, into chemistry.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:01.220]   But then I found myself doing something else.
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:02.580]   I went back to the piano.
[01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:06.300]   I took piano as a teenager, it led nowhere.
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:08.660]   But as an adult, I went back to the piano.
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:10.020]   We have a piano in the house.
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:13.860]   Came from my in-laws because I wanted to know something
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:14.860]   in my fingers.
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:17.860]   I didn't want to know something in my logic.
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:22.260]   I knew that the way that I usually would understand things
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:24.660]   would be rationally and logically.
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:29.660]   But I wanted to be able to play and be able to play again,
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:32.220]   purely so that it was in my fingers.
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:35.320]   And I also wanted to be able to visualize.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.340]   So I got to a point now where I started to be able to now,
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:41.300]   to be able to see a cell.
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:44.620]   And I could visualize mitochondrial moving now
[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:47.180]   up into the dendrites at the cell membrane.
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:49.940]   So that visualization capacity,
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:52.340]   as well as the musical capacity,
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:56.340]   was my intuitive way of starting now more and more
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:59.020]   to get me to lean into the right,
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:01.860]   to be able to learn how to be in the right.
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:03.260]   - Amazing.
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:04.100]   I love this.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:08.260]   And I'll refrain from sharing my, you know,
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:11.380]   personal use of such a sort of,
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:13.580]   I guess we call them avenues into the right.
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:16.980]   But I want to make clear, I understand.
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:20.260]   You're in the stacks of books in the library.
[01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:23.820]   It feels and sounds like a cognitive endeavor,
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:25.420]   a left-brain endeavor.
[01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:27.100]   But then it just came to you.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:28.740]   I want to play the piano.
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:33.380]   Or through the research that you were doing,
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:36.380]   this 10-year self-research, amazing, by the way.
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:38.180]   I'm like so struck by that.
[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:40.620]   Then, did it just come to you in a flash?
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:42.460]   Like, I want to play the piano again.
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:45.900]   And was it because playing the piano contrasted so much
[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:48.060]   with looking through the stacks, or they were aligned?
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:53.060]   - No, it just, those, for me, that was exploration.
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:56.180]   It was exploration, it was all new information.
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:57.900]   And I found that I could master more
[01:56:57.900 --> 01:56:59.780]   than what the field that I was trained in.
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:01.980]   Let me give you one other experiences
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:05.140]   that is a lot of evidence to show.
[01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:08.300]   The aha experience is right-brain also.
[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:11.500]   So there are times when literally insights
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:14.100]   will come quickly and suddenly,
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:15.620]   and they'll seem to come out of nowhere.
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:17.660]   And all of a sudden, the muse is there.
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:19.900]   So that was an aha experience.
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:20.820]   And when I thought about it,
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:22.500]   it just made all kinds of sense.
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:23.980]   I mean, there was a purpose to it,
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:28.460]   because again, I needed to get past doing that.
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:31.140]   Let me tell you something else that I decided to do
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:33.220]   very early on as I was setting off
[01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:35.380]   into this 10-year period.
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:38.180]   I decided never to memorize anything.
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:41.420]   - Tell me more.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:44.180]   - It's a lot of effort that gets nowhere.
[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:45.780]   Literally what I wanted to do
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:47.620]   is I wanted to understand it
[01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:49.780]   in the way that I could understand it.
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:53.900]   So there's a lot of wasted time in memorization.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:57.020]   And that being the case, as you can imagine,
[01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:58.860]   I have a rather enormous memory.
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:01.340]   I know where things are, I know where they are,
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.580]   I know how to get them.
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:04.460]   I know what's important,
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:06.780]   and I know how to put it into a place where I can get,
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:08.100]   I know where that article is.
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:10.300]   And incidentally, when I'm working,
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:14.020]   originally, I would write everything down,
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:15.620]   and the writing had an effect
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:17.980]   of putting that more into my memory.
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:20.420]   Even now, when I'm studying,
[01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:24.580]   I'll take papers, I'll Xerox them,
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:26.060]   and I'll read them at my desk.
[01:58:26.060 --> 01:58:29.220]   I will not read and study right off the computer.
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:32.780]   In other words, I was learning my own technique of learning.
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:37.380]   - So important, I often get asked,
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:38.740]   what's your note-taking process?
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:40.260]   How do you prepare a solo episode?
[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:41.500]   I do these long solos
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:43.540]   that I have only a few pages of notes.
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:44.940]   But I could describe it,
[01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:47.900]   but the process is so specific to the way that I learn
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:50.140]   across the whatever, six, eight, 10 weeks
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:51.740]   that it takes me to prepare for one of those,
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:55.540]   sometimes more, that it wouldn't really translate.
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:57.020]   Like, it doesn't matter.
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:59:00.620]   - No, but there's a process of introspection there,
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:03.260]   about literally, how do I learn,
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:08.020]   and how can I literally absorb the information
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:09.420]   so that it goes in deep?
[01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:12.540]   The left hemisphere, essentially, is the surface hemisphere.
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:15.780]   The right hemisphere is the one of depth, so to speak.
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:17.740]   And what goes into the right, for example,
[01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:20.420]   if you have an experience, an emotional experience,
[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:21.820]   that's really important,
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:24.180]   that goes deep into your autobiographical memory.
[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:25.940]   That's much deeper than your attempting
[01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:30.940]   to memorize something at any point in time.
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.140]   - Given the extreme importance
[01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:34.700]   of this right brain circuitry
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:39.700]   and of this autonomic synchrony between mother,
[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:43.840]   and typically mother, primary caretaker, that is,
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:47.100]   and infant, what are some things
[01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:49.300]   that are known from the literature
[01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:51.820]   as critically important about that stage
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:56.820]   in terms of amount of time spent with the child?
[01:59:56.820 --> 02:00:00.060]   Oftentimes, parents are working.
[02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:02.660]   There are nannies, or any number of different things.
[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:04.360]   There are a lot of different structures nowadays
[02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:07.020]   for families and balancing work and family.
[02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:09.020]   But is there anything known about how to,
[02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:10.260]   I hate to use the word optimize,
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:14.100]   but maximize the health of the relationship?
[02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:16.660]   - Yeah, I don't think that this culture,
[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:18.160]   compared to other cultures,
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:20.780]   really provides for that kind of time.
[02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:25.100]   I think that people are stressed because of that.
[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:27.460]   And now I'm gonna talk about maternal leave
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:30.680]   and paternal leave in other rich countries.
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:36.180]   The paternal leave is three months,
[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:41.060]   and maternal leave is six months or more in Scandinavia.
[02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:44.580]   So these other countries have figured out
[02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:48.140]   this time of life is critical,
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:51.220]   that if you really want to affect a personality
[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:56.420]   and help shape that personality to be a moral person
[02:00:56.420 --> 02:00:58.820]   or to have values, et cetera,
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:02.620]   the time literally that they put in is the earliest years.
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:04.980]   That's when it's there, so to speak.
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:08.500]   And without that kind of leave policy,
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:13.500]   in this country, most people go back to work at six weeks.
[02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:16.540]   Six weeks is at the beginning
[02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:19.160]   of the critical period of the right brain.
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:22.900]   The autonomic nervous system is in a critical period
[02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:24.380]   at six to eight weeks.
[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:27.440]   The amygdala is coming into a critical period.
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:31.280]   The basolateral amygdala, the insula, and the cingulate
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:34.020]   are in a critical period at that point in time.
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:38.180]   This is before the child has formed an attachment
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:40.260]   or a separation.
[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:45.060]   So I see this as literally, and as I'm well aware of,
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:47.900]   there's now talking about this more and more.
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:49.780]   In fact, the recent debate,
[02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:53.860]   there was discussion of this also about this problem.
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:58.020]   The London School of Economics had a study
[02:01:58.020 --> 02:01:59.780]   about what is the best predictor,
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:04.620]   the best childhood predictor of adult satisfaction in life.
[02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:07.840]   And the best predictor was emotion,
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:10.860]   and the second was the child's conduct,
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:15.380]   and the third and last was the child's IQ.
[02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:17.780]   We have things upside down here.
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:22.780]   We are focusing too much on executive functions
[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:25.380]   that come online at the third year.
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:27.460]   And again, what I'm suggesting to you
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:30.980]   is that the whole foundations of our personality
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:34.900]   are starting in utero through the second and the third year,
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:37.260]   and then with the father, et cetera.
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:40.060]   That's where we literally should be putting the money,
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:43.220]   and the money should be there so that it provides the time.
[02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:46.240]   Every other culture has figured this out.
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:51.240]   The UNICEF took a poll in 2021 of 36 countries,
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:56.620]   rich countries, we came in last in emotional well-being,
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:58.380]   childhood well-being.
[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:00.100]   Shame.
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:03.780]   - It is a shame.
[02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:05.700]   What's wonderful, however,
[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:08.380]   is that you're highlighting these issues.
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.000]   So many people are hearing about this,
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.940]   and I encourage everyone listening
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:17.940]   to really take in the ordering of importance
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:19.860]   of what Dr. Shore just shared,
[02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:23.380]   that IQ, third on the list, emotion regulation,
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:26.100]   number one.
[02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:28.420]   - Conduct. - Conduct, yeah.
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:33.200]   So the idea that we need to train our kids up
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:37.680]   as little memorizing computers is clearly the wrong idea.
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:39.360]   Clearly, there's important information
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:40.960]   that needs to be committed to memory
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.900]   to be a functional human being,
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:47.800]   but that we're missing not just critical knowledge transfer,
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:49.740]   but critical emotional transfer.
[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:54.780]   And for that reason, and for so many other reasons,
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:57.180]   I really want to thank you for coming in today
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:59.540]   and having this conversation.
[02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:02.740]   It's unlike any conversation I've had on this podcast,
[02:04:02.740 --> 02:04:05.060]   for several reasons, not the least of which
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:08.140]   is that you have this incredible knowledge
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:10.480]   of the neurobiology, which for me is a delight,
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:11.940]   and I'm sure for the listeners too,
[02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:15.900]   but also the clinical experience, which is so rich.
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:18.500]   And it's clear you've also done your own work
[02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:22.000]   in exploring these ideas, and you've been here for,
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.660]   and participated in the evolution
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:25.740]   of this whole right brain, left brain thing,
[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:27.180]   you know, the advent of neuroimaging
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:28.900]   and how that's really shed new light.
[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:31.780]   And I just love, love, love the way
[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:34.620]   that you braid all this together
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:37.160]   in terms of actionable things with patient and therapist,
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:39.800]   but also just in terms of one's understanding of self.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:42.780]   I'm certain people are going to take this knowledge
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:44.300]   into their lives and into the world,
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:46.420]   and it's been really enriching for me,
[02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:48.060]   and I'm certain it's going to be
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:50.080]   immensely enriching for them.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:51.540]   So thank you for the work you do.
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:53.660]   Thank you for taking the time to come here today,
[02:04:53.660 --> 02:04:55.780]   and I'm excited about your new book,
[02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:58.560]   so keep us informed as to when that comes out.
[02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:00.480]   Maybe we'll have you back on for another discussion
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:01.700]   if you're willing.
[02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:04.400]   And just, you know, just thank you so much
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:09.400]   for entering this left brain, right brain dance and dynamic.
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.940]   It's been thoroughly enjoyable for me.
[02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:13.060]   - Absolute pleasure for me too, Andrew.
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:14.700]   Absolute pleasure.
[02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:16.340]   - Thank you. - Thank you.
[02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:18.520]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:20.100]   with Dr. Alan Shor.

[02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:57.880]   I do read all the comments.
[02:05:57.880 --> 02:05:59.020]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:00.240]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:01.840]   It's my very first book.
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.240]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:05.380]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:06.560]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:07.720]   for more than five years,
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:10.040]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:11.600]   of research and experience.
[02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:14.640]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:17.140]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:19.600]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:22.960]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:25.040]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:28.940]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:31.320]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:33.080]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:34.000]   Again, the book is called
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.520]   "Protocols, An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:39.820]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:42.920]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:45.640]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:47.440]   LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:48.660]   And on all those platforms,
[02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:50.600]   I discuss science and science-based tools,
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:52.120]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:53.600]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:55.440]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:57.080]   covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:07:00.520]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:01.800]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:03.640]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:04.800]   the Neural Network Newsletter
[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:06.480]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:08.320]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.680]   as well as brief one-to-three-page PDFs
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:12.240]   that cover protocols for things
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:14.800]   like deliberate heat exposure, deliberate cold exposure.
