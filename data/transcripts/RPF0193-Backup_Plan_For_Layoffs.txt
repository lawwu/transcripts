[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   - Yesterday I shared with you the fact that
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   recession is coming in the future,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   and one of the most important things you can do
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   is to plan not to lose your job.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   But obviously, even though you might plan
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   not to lose your job and do all those things yesterday,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   there are going to be certain things
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   that are outside of your control.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   So today, I want to talk to you about
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   how to make a plan of what you will do
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   if you lose your job.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   This is episode 193, part two of our three-part series
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   here on what to do if you lose your job.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Today I'm going to help you think it through,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   and there are a bunch of reasons for this.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Most importantly, by having thought it through,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   you'll probably react a little bit better
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   and respond a little bit better if it happens to you.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   But more importantly, there's some stuff
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   you've got to be doing now
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   so that you're better off if you lose your job.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Whether or not you actually implement
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   some of the things that I talk to you about
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   in today's show, that's up to you, and I hope you do.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   But I know that many of you won't,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   simply because that's the fact, that many times
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   many of us listen to ideas that are good
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and we don't actually implement them.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Even if you don't do anything
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   with the content of today's show,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I think you're still going to be better off,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   and that's why I'm going ahead and doing it for you.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   My hope is that you'll do something with it.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   If you don't do anything, obviously,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   you will probably just grab a few things
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   and start implementing just a few things,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   and hopefully that will help you
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   to fare a little bit better.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   See, a lot of this type of planning
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   is defensive risk management planning.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's insurance planning.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   But it's not about buying an insurance policy.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It's about the things that you can do
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   to prepare yourself
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   for when everything goes wrong.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Things go wrong in everybody's life.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   But depending on our level of preparation
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   for those things,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   the impact is different.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And my hope is that some of these ideas
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   that I have to share with you today
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   will help you to make a plan
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and put that plan in place
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   so that if you lose your job,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   whether that's because you get fired
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   at a one-off scenario due to a mistake
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   that you made, an honest mistake it could be,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   or something else,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   or whether you get laid off,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   or you get fired,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   or something else,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   or whether you get laid off
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   in a round of layoffs in a coming recession,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   something like that,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   or your business that you're working for
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   just simply goes belly up,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   my hope is that these ideas
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   will help you to have a plan in place.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   It's impossible to guarantee
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   not losing your job.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I've been laid off.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I realized today when I was preparing
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   some of my notes here
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   that I've actually been laid off twice.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's a decision which we'll come to
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   in the course of today's show.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   There are many factors beyond your control
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   and it's important to have a plan.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Now, as I emphasized yesterday,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I believe the best plan
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   is to simply be in front of the trends.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And the farther you can think ahead
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   in life, in every area of life,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   the better.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So, for example,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   let's say that you are going to plan
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   to be able to protect yourself
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and protect your family
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   if you get attacked by a violent thief.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And in order to do that,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   you have put in place
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   a variety of preparation
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   measures.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   First, you have gone ahead
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   and studied some
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   basic martial arts, so you have some
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   basic hand-to-hand self-defense tools.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   You carry a knife on your person,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   so you have a basic bit of
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   defensive equipment.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You carry a concealed firearm.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   You carry some pepper spray.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And you're well prepared
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   in case something happens.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I think all of those things would be good
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   things for you to do.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   But make sure to start
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   with the fact of
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   this advice.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Don't go to stupid places with stupid people
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   and do stupid things.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   If you follow that advice,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   you can avoid a lot of the situations
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   in which you ever need
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   any of those things.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   The vast majority of us, thankfully,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   will never be in a violent confrontation
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   in our life.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   But you can help improve your odds
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   by not going to
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   stupid places with stupid people
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   and doing stupid things.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I can't remember who that was, but I heard say that one time.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It was a firearms instructor
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   who gave that, and I said, "That is the best way to describe
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   it ever." So that was what yesterday was about,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   is let's get out in front of the trends.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I can't predict the day-to-day
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   vagaries of the stock market,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   but I do have inside knowledge
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   on my own industry, and I might
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   have some inside knowledge on my own company.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And so I can see what's
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   coming to a certain extent, and I can change my
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   course.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And that's where we start with
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   regard to preparation,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   is change your course ahead
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   of time so you don't get caught unaware
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and get laid off.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   But now today, we recognize the fact
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   that things can
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   happen, and
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   even though
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   you might be doing something intelligent
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   with upstanding people
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   in a safe location,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   bad things happen.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And so being prepared
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   with a defensive plan is important, and today
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   is that defensive plan.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   By thinking through your defensive
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   plan, you'll be able to
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   avoid a lot of the emotion
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   that other people are going to face.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   If you study people who
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   are often forced to respond
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   to stressful situations,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   think of law enforcement officers,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   think of first responders who are responding to an
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   accident, think of military people
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   who are going into a firefight.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   What do they do in advance of those
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   situations to prepare?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Well, many things, but
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   specifically today, they will think
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   through,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   "What am I going to do in that situation?" And they'll practice
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   it, and they'll rehearse it.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   The more intense and the more stressful
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   the situation is likely to be,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   the more the person going into it
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   is going to have practiced it again and again and again
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and again.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   That way, when they're in the middle of the difficult situation,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   there's a higher probability
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   that they're not going to be shell-shocked,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   that they're not going to be caught
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and stupefied by the
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   adrenaline and by the shock of the situation.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   They're much more likely to be able to continue
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   to function. It's not
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   guaranteed, but it's a much higher
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   likelihood. And there are various ways
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   to do that. You can do it with an all-out
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   practice and a rehearsal.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   That's what people in those difficult
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and stressful environments will do, is they'll rehearse
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   again and again, physically rehearse.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But you can also do it just mentally.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   You can just think through some things.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   At least having thought through something
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   will make it much more likely
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   that everything's going to be fine and you'll come
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   out the other side.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Chances are, if you've practiced in advance,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   even something simple, like for me,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   one of the things I've tried to pay attention
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   to is, if I'm going to be in a stressful
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   situation, I think of car accidents, I think of
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   any kind of
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   difficult medical situation,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   breathe, breathe, relax,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   breathe, slow down, think, relax.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And I found myself
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   when I've been in some situations like
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   that, unexpectedly had a couple car accidents
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   and all of a sudden, my mind was
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   kicked in, just telling myself, breathe,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   relax, breathe, relax. Now, of course,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I'm nothing special, but
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   just thinking of it in advance is my point. It'll help
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   you to it. And being laid
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   off or being fired is a tough
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   situation. I
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   remember very keenly
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   what it was like to be laid off. It was
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   emotionally devastating.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   It's tough because it attacks your
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   self-confidence. No matter how
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   much you can justify it, you still
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   have a
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   tendency to feel worthless,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   to feel like you're not
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   valuable, because obviously, if you were valuable, they would have
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   kept you around. The truth
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   is, people get laid off all the time for
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   all kinds of reasons. So,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   let's think it through and consider
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   what you would do.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Just by talking it through and planning a little bit, I believe
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   that this will help you in the future
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   so that even though you may
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   still experience those feelings,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   the stress of those feelings
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   and the negative impact of those feelings, my
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   hope is that that'll be
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   a little bit reduced for you.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Emotionally, getting
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   laid off and having to change your lifestyle
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   because of it is
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   extremely difficult
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   for many people.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I think of a
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   specific person that I had
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   occasion to interact with. This person
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   had spent years as a salesperson
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   and had a very established
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   career as a salesperson
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   in a very large national company.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   He was here in Florida.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   This person had
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   a great job.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   They'd been there
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   forever. They were
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   well-ranked. I still don't
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   know why they were laid off, but
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   they were laid off. I never
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   could figure it out.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   The challenge was that they were in the
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   expensive phase of life.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   They'd moved into the
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   comfortable upper middle class
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   lifestyle house, quite fancy.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Not super fancy, not ostentatious,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   but very comfortable
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   with a very comfortable mortgage payment.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The kids were in
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   private schools.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   They were enjoying the normal
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   status symbols of life.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   They were not foolish.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   They were normal.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   They were prudent. Didn't have
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   an unreasonable debt load. It wasn't like
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   they had hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   of credit card debt.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   But they were laid off.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Because
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   they had spent so much time at that
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   company, basically
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   all of their identity was wrapped up in
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   that company.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Because they were so active in the community,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   they were known as being
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   identified with that company.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   So then,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   what do you do?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Well, I watched them go
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   for a long time and not make quick decisions
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   because they couldn't
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   face the difficulty
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   of the humiliation of making quick
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   decisions. The thought of pulling the kids
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   out of private school was a devastating thought
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   because of the impact on the kids.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Ultimately, they had
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   to do that, but they waited too
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   long. Selling the fancy
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   house was a devastating thought because
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   it was an admission of, in their
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   mind, going back from
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   the higher lifestyle that they had
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   achieved to that
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   lower lifestyle. And that was
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   humiliating.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   But they had to sell the house.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Unfortunately, though, they'd moved
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   so slowly because
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   of lack of prior planning
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   that it really, really was difficult
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   to recover.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   The story impacted me hugely because
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   to see a grown person so
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   devastated from a simple job
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   loss to me was pretty shocking.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I couldn't do
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   in that circumstance, I couldn't do very much
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   to help. They were working to find another sales
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   job, but their confidence was shot.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And it's tough to find a good
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   sales job, and it's tough to get started
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   in sales when your confidence is shot.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   I've thought about it a lot since that
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   meeting. I think about it constantly
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   for me, and I plan.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And I think, and I run the scenarios,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I run the war game.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   I say, "Okay, if I lost everything, what would I do?"
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Well, that keeps me from
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   taking out debt on cars because
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   then I wouldn't be in a situation like they were in
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   to have to sell the car all of a sudden.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I keep monthly
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   expenses low, not just for this, but
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   this was a situation that influenced me.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Keep monthly expenses low so that
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   I can quickly pivot and take any kind
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   of job that comes along to keep my mortgage
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and keep my family in our house.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   I look at things, every aspect of
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   our spending, and I think about, "Okay, if I had
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   to cut this, how would I do it?" I look at our food
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   budget and I say, "Okay, if I needed to cut from $500
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   a month to $200 a month, how would I do it?"
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Okay, I'd stop eating meat, and I'd move
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   to beans and eggs for protein.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   We'd eat fewer fresh vegetables, and we'd
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   eat more canned ones from the pantry.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   We'd eat more rice and more
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   pasta and more bread than we eat right now,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   and no, that wouldn't be good for the long
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   term, but it would certainly be fine for
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   the short term. We'd buy some multivitamins
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   to help replace some of the lost nutrients
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and try to make up for it that way.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Okay, well, let's say if I really
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   had to cut to the bone, then I'd
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   cancel the internet and I'd go work from the library.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   We would not spend any money
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   on entertainment. We'd get it all for free online
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   from the library. We'd get DVDs
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   from the library or whatever we needed to do.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   We'd read for free from the library. We'd go on
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   walks instead of things that cost money.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I haven't been in the situation of
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   having a 13-year-old in private
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   school and having to tell him or her,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   "Okay, I've got to pull you out," but I've thought
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   about, "Okay, what would I do?" I'd try to position it as an
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   adventure, not a sacrifice.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Although they would need to know why we
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   were doing it, how could I moderate
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   that? And the
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   reality is in the modern day, it's
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   pretty easy to live a pretty
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   incredible lifestyle for
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   not much money at all.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   But we're primarily trapped
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   in our heads
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   into our normal.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   So, in my mind,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   thinking it through in advance
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   allows you to escape
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   the trap before it happens.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   You'll probably be
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   blindsided.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   It'll probably upset
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   you, but hopefully it'll only last
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   for a couple of days.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   The emotional upset, if you get laid off,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   will hopefully only last for a couple of days
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   instead of for weeks or months
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   because months
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   are devastating.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   So yesterday I led with the overall
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   kind of motivational type stuff.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Today I want to flip it and start with some of
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   the tactical financial things first, and then
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   we'll go back and work on the
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   career-related items.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   The tactical financial things that
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   you need to think through primarily focus
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   on two different areas. Number one,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   what would be the effect in your household of
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   losing the direct income from
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   your job, losing your paycheck,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   the actual money that gets
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   direct deposited into your checking account?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And then what would be the effect
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   of losing some of the indirect benefits,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   losing your insurance benefits, retirement
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   benefits, or any other miscellaneous
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   benefits associated with your job?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   They both matter, but usually
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   it's the income and paycheck that has the most
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   immediate effect.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   So let's start there.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   What would you do if suddenly I
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   took away your paycheck?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I cancelled
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   your income. No severance,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   no anything, just today.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Gone.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   How wealthy
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   are you?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   In this context,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I particularly like
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Buckminster Fuller's definition of wealth.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   His definition of wealth
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   was how many months can you live your
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   current lifestyle if you lost your job?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   That's how wealthy you are.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   If you could live for
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   five months, then you're five months wealthy.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   If you could live for a year, then you're one year
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   wealthy. It's kind of a nice
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   definition of wealth. I like it.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Especially in this context.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   So think about that. How wealthy
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   are you? If you were to
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   compare your assets,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   your savings and your investments
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   to your monthly expenses,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   how many months could
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   you live?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Now, some of you, I don't know if it's
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   most or if it's some. I know this audience
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   probably has a much higher
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   level of wealth than the general population,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   but some of you could live for the rest of your lives.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   That's awesome.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Many of you could live for many months
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   and many years without even noticing
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   the direct loss of income.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   But across the nation,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   I'm sure there are some of you listening who
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   could maybe get through a few months.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Because
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   as US Americans, and I'm
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   sure it's similar in other western countries
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   that are listening,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   we don't have much in terms of
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   savings.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Many US Americans are
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   a paycheck or two away from bankruptcy
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   or at least
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   insolvency.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   So think about that.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Start putting things in place now
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   to protect yourself.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   The first thing you can do is
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   protect yourself by not having
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   a high consumption, highly
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   leveraged lifestyle.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   If you have low
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   fixed expenses, then you have flexibility.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Now, obviously
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   this would have to be adjusted
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   for your situation in terms of scale.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   If you're making, say, $10 an hour
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   and you have only a few hundred dollars
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   set aside in savings, then
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   you could be wiped out by something as
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   simple as a $199 a month
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   car payment if you were to lose your job.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   It's happened to many people.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   On the other hand, if you're accustomed to making
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   say, half a million dollars a year
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   and you have a few hundred thousand dollars in cash
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   that's just sitting there in liquid
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   accounts,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   then having a $2,000 a month
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   boat payment is probably not going to wipe
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   you out. But on the other
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   hand, if you are highly leveraged
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   and have a lot of monthly payments, no matter how
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   incredible your
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   income is, you still could be
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   wiped out. I'll
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   give you some fun homework here
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   to think about. Go
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   if you have a Netflix subscription, or I don't
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   know if it's on Amazon Prime or wherever you consume
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   your online media, go and watch
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   a movie, a documentary called
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   The Queen of Versailles.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   My wife and I watched it on Netflix some months ago
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   and it was fascinating. Absolutely
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   fascinating. It tells the story
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   of a couple named Jackie
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   and David Siegel.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   They are the owners of Westgate
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Resorts, one of the largest timeshare
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   companies in the nation.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   In 2008,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   the real challenge was in 2008
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   they
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   basically went
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   successively through a process of
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   losing all of their wealth.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   I don't know what the level of his
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   net worth was before
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   the financial crisis.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Some hundreds of millions,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I don't know if it was a billion dollars, but
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   he and his wife were in the process
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   of building a house they called Versailles.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   It was a 90,000, it is a 90,000
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   square foot house in
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Florida, New Orlando.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   One of the biggest
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   houses in the United States. It has
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   11 kitchens and 13
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   bedrooms and 30 bathrooms and a
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   20 car garage and a two lane bowling
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   alley and an indoor roller skating rink and
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   three indoor pools and two
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   outdoor pools and a video
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   arcade and a ballroom with a 500
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   person capacity, a two story
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   movie theater with a balcony inspired
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   by the Paris Opera House, a
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   fitness center with a 10,000
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   square foot spa, yoga studios,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   20,000 bottle wine cellar, exotic
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   fish aquarium, two tennis courts,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   a baseball diamond and a formal outdoor
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   garden and an elevator in the master bedroom
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   closet.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   So, it's a big house
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   and
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   massively expensive.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Well, his
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   the value of his real estate
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   started to change substantially in
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   2008 and
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   the
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   his financing
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   dried up and basically
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   everything turned and it's the most dramatic
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   scene. Even though the house
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Versailles was not finished at the time, the
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   house they were living in was certainly quite
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   opulent and quite large and in the most
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   absurd scene, here comes
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   this man, David, comes
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   home and starts yelling at his family for
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   leaving the lights on
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   in a house that, I don't know, has four or five
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   air conditioners and
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   he's coming in and he's mad that somebody left
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   the front door open and that
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   somebody is leaving the lights on
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   and it's almost just this crazy
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   perspective when you look and
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   say, "Are you kidding me?"
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   That you're dealing with this kind
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   of scale and it's stressing you out that the
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   lights are on? Well, it was just a reflection of
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   the stress that he was facing, trying to
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   figure out how to renegotiate
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   a billion dollars of debt and trying
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   to go all over the world and find somebody who could lend
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   him money. But the point is
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   you've still
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   got to make
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   sure that your fixed expenses are
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   low, especially as regards
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   your level of income.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And one of the important
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   things to consider as far as the flip side
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   of scale is
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   that in many ways, if you are accustomed
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   to a high lifestyle, it would
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   behoove you to be even more conservative
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   than those who
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   are just scraping by
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   because if you need
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   a $10 an hour job to pay your bills, you
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   can have one at the end of the day, anytime you want one.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   But if you need a half a million
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   dollar a year job to pay your bills,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   that might take a little bit more
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   time to find. It usually does.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   If you're at the lower
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   end of the pay scale, it's not that tough to get
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   a new job. If you're at the higher
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   end, it's a bit tougher.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   If you're at the lower end of the
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   pay scale, anytime you want, you can go out and make money
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   as a day laborer. I used to
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   hire guys in a previous job. I used to
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   hire guys here in West Palm Beach when I needed some
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   day labor and
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   would go up and there was, you know,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   there's the places in every city where
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   usually it's primarily
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Spanish immigrant workers
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   primarily who would
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   come there and they'd hang out together and you'd come
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   by and I'd come by in my pickup truck
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and try to deal with them. The amazing
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   thing though, I loved doing it because
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   it was kind of the microcosm of the labor market
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   in general, was they
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   wouldn't work for less than $10 an hour at a
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   minimum and the better workers
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   would always get more.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It's one of the reasons why I always
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   get a little bit annoyed by the minimum wage debate
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   because the market demand sets the
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   rates. It doesn't matter what the minimum wage happens to be.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Just go, if you
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   want to see the labor market in a
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   microcosm, go hire some day laborers
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   and you'll see the market forces at work.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   You pull up and you tell
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   the guys the kind of work that you need
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   and they'll bid against one another depending
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   on who needs the work and most of the time they'll have
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   a similar price, again $10 to $12
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   an hour depending on labor seems to be
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   normal, at least it was a few years ago.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   But then sometimes one guy will come forward and work for
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   less and that's the labor market in a
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   microcosm. Employees
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   competing against employees and
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   employers competing against employers
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   and depending on the supply and depending
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   on the demand, rates go up
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   and rates go down. If you get there late in the
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   morning and there are still a lot of
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   guys there, the rates go down because
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   if they don't get picked up in the morning in the day labor market
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   then they might not be able to work that day.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   But rates are high
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   when there's a lot of demand and
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   not much supply. So, little
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   side trip there but make sure
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   you recognize that. If you need a half a
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   million dollar a year job to maintain your lifestyle
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   consider being conservative
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   because you don't get those tomorrow
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   when you need $10 like
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   you can when you need $10 an hour.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Having a low fixed
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   expense lifestyle can be a huge help
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   to you if you lose your job.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Again, if you have no debt
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   it doesn't matter practically
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   how big your
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   house is, if you don't have a mortgage on it
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   you can go take a job at the closest retail shop
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   and you'll still be able to eat and
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   maybe pay the property taxes.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Having low expenses
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   always buys you flexibility.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Next, make sure that you have
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   easily available cash reserves
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   and frankly the more the better.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Up to a point of course.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Sometime in the next few weeks I'll do a show
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   called "How Big Should My Emergency Fund Be?"
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   in which I'll
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   give you the CFP board formulas
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   which those of you who are financial planning students
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   will need to pass the CFP exam.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I'll give you the formulas and the formal technical
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   ways, but in general
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   the more the better, up to a point.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   If you look at your situation
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   and think about it, the answer might
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   be intuitive for you.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   How many months can you live without income if you lose your
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   job? How stable or unstable
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   is your job or your living situation?
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Do you have multiple
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   sources of income in your house or just
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   one? If
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   you have just one, you're
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   working and let's say you have a stay-at-home spouse,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   then
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   you need a bigger emergency fund than if both
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   of you are working and have streams of income.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Or you need a bigger emergency fund than if
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   one of you is earning income and you have
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   a side business.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   If you have lower fixed needs, then you can have
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   a smaller account. Higher, you need more.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   If you're accustomed to having
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   a fluctuating income
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   or if you think that might happen,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   then you should have a higher amount of
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   savings. I've been accustomed
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   to working on 100% straight commission,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   which means I need more
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   cash available to me to get me through the
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   tough times than somebody who's working on a regular
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   weekly salary paycheck.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   I personally get
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   very concerned and a bit sad
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   when I see people who work in
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   seasonal, volatile industries
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   who take on high monthly payments
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   and operate without large
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   cash reserves. I think
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   the mortgage industry is a good example. In the past,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   in 2008, I was a financial advisor
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   and – or 2009, basically –
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   and I remember meeting with a lot of people in the mortgage
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   business and just watching them as
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   their industry was imploding.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   They had levered
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   their lifestyle up
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   with all kinds of fancy stuff
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   and all kinds of fancy payments associated.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Then, one by one,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   they lost everything.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   So, don't do it.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Life goes in seasons.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Sometimes you plant and sometimes
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   you harvest, but you need to pay attention to
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   what season you're in. You need to recognize
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   that the season is going to change.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   I wish more of us were farmers
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   or at least had some closer connection
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   to the natural
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   cycle of seasons because farmers have to think
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   in terms of an annual cycle and the money comes
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   at the end of the season. The money comes when you
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   sell your crops in the fall
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   and yet there are going to be other parts
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   of the season.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Don't spend all the money
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   in winter
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   when you need it to buy your seed in the spring
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   just because the money is flowing in
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   in the fall doesn't mean you go and spend it all in the fall.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   It's got to get you through the year.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Practically speaking,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   try to keep lines of financing
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   and lines of credit open
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   and available to you in advance in case
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   you ever need them.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   You need to establish the home equity
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   line of credit on the house before you get laid
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   off. That way it's there and it's available
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   to you if you need it. You don't have to answer
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   the income questions at that point in time.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   You've already established it.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Keep the credit card lines
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   of credit available to you before
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   you get laid off so that they're there
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   if or when you ever need them.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Now obviously you need to consider carefully
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   if you can trust yourself.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   If you have
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   a problem with compulsive
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   spending, it'll probably save you money to not have the
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   credit cards even available to you.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   But if you are a normal,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   disciplined person, it
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   might be helpful to you to have those things available
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   because
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   when you need the money, that's not the time
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   to go out and try to get the credit.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Have the lines of credit established to you
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   before you ever -- and available to you before
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   you ever need it.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Consider not only working in the system
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   of cash and cash reserves, but
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   also stockpiling some of the
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   basic needs of life, whatever's appropriate
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   to you. But especially if you're
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   at the lower end of the income scale
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   on the wealth scale, this will make a much
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   bigger difference in your life than many other
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   things. In my family,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   we try to buy in bulk whenever it makes sense.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   So if there's a sale
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   at the grocery store on something that
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   will last, that my family uses,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I'll buy the entire shelf out.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   I remember coming home one time
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   with something like 30 or 40 jars of
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   peanut butter. We eat a lot of peanut butter and
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   I just bought the shelf out.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Or simple things -- we don't have
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   as much freezer space as we probably
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   should -- but simple things like
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   stocking up on Thanksgiving turkeys.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   When turkey's two bucks a pound
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   and you can buy six of them and
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   have one every other month, that's a lot
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   better than buying chicken at $5.50
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   a pound. So stock up.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Now the cool thing is, that will
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   help you in times of fluctuating income.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Consider
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   doing simple things like having
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   some reserves of food.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   For us, we need it for hurricane season. For some
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   of you, it may be the prospect
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   of facing winter blizzards.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   But it works both ways.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Because if you buy more food when it's
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   cheap and on sale, you'll save money
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   as you normally use it.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   But you'll also have food in your pantry
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   if you're laid off.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And so if you have three months
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   of food worth in your pantry, then that's
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   three months of cash that you wouldn't have to
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   spend on food, and you
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   could use the cash to
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   keep your electric bill paid.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Or, if you have
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   three months of food in your pantry
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   and, let's say you normally spend $500
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   a month on food, then you can
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   stretch the $1,500 emergency fund
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   into six months of food
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   by simply buying less.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   You buy half of what you normally
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   would buy
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   at the store, and you supplement the other half
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   out of your pantry.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   And
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   obviously, if the
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   currency were stable and you just had all
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   the money, then the
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   major savings is
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   the fact that you're getting things at a discount.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   But that's compelling over time.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And it can make a big difference
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   when you need it. I remember
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   reading a story, and I'll post a link to it in the show notes,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   but I remember years ago reading this
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   story on the Prudent
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Homemaker blog, and this lady shared
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   her family's experience with
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   their food storage program.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   They were a Mormon family, and in the
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Mormon church, they recommend
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   to people that they have a
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   year's worth of food on hand as a prudent
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   item of preparedness.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And this lady told the
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   story, her husband was a real estate
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   agent in Las Vegas.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And all of a sudden, the bottom fell out
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   of the Las Vegas real estate market, and
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   he didn't have a sale or work for a year.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   And it's pretty remarkable
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   because she tells the story of how
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   essentially the fact that they had
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   food stored got them through that year.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Pretty remarkable.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   It's definitely worth
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   reading. I'll link it in the show notes.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   These are some skills that
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   have atrophied in our culture.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   My father
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   grew up on a ranch in Colorado,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   and his parents,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   they shopped once a year.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   In the fall before winter,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   that was when they went to town.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   This wasn't Little Home
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   on the Prairie. They had a
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   car, they could drive to town,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   but it was too expensive for them to drive to town
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   all the time, so they would shop basically
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   once a year. After they sold
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   the cattle, then they would take the money and they would buy
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   the supplies they needed. But those skills are
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   largely atrophied in many of us.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   I guess I'm probably more
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   sensitive to these things than
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   many people. I've
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   personally been so broke that I was
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   putting gas in the tank $5 at a time
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   to make one
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   trip. I remember
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   that vividly. And so
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   some of the things of life that I really appreciate,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I'm often thankful when I can simply
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   pull into a gas station and
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   swipe the card and not pay any attention
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   to the numbers on the screen. That's a luxury.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   I'm close enough to being
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   that broke that
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   for me, I still appreciate that.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   I hope I never lose that appreciation
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   because there are billions of people
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   in the world who don't have that luxury
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   that so many of us have.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   I've traveled a bit in countries
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   where dads and moms regularly
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   can't feed their kids.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Consider that.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I don't
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   want that to happen to my family and it's my
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   responsibility to do everything I can to make
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   sure that it doesn't.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And also to help make sure it doesn't
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   happen to others.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Most of us are pretty insulated from that
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   level of poverty in the United States.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   We live in time of
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   mass prosperity as
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   a society and mass availability
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   of the simple things of
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   life. But
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   individually it could happen to any
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   one of us. It happened to many families
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   in the recessions of 2008
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and 2009.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   And another one will come.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   So put the plans in
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   place so that it doesn't happen to you.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Now
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   adjust these things to
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   your scale.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Whatever is appropriate in your lifestyle.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   When you
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   combine cash
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   savings and material
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   savings of the things that you need in your life
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   with
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   having low fixed costs
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and if possible
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   no debt, then you can
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   weather the storm of a layoff or a
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   recession much better.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   So for some people
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   this starts with food in the pantry. For others
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   maybe it means having a cheap camper
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   as a backup plan. For others maybe you
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   have a paid off vacation home or
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   say backup property to
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   retreat to if your local economy falls apart
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   and your personal house goes into
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   foreclosure. But think
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   defensively and then
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   put things into place.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Think about
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   what would you do if I took away your
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   income? Start with taking it away for
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   a month, take it away for three months,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   take it away for six months,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   take it away for a year
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   and work through those mental
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   exercises. Take it away for two years.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Work
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   through those exercises. See what you would
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   do.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   That was
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   some thoughts regarding income. What about benefits?
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Quickly here, there are some
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   things here you'll want to do and some things
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   that you'll not
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   need to do but just mention a few things.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Go through your group benefits or
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   think through them and see what you would lose
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   if you lost your job.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Would you lose your health insurance?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   If you did, what would you do?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Now this one's a lot easier now after
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   the Affordable Care Act than it used to be
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   because now we can basically ignore
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   the concept of pre-existing conditions
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   for years. We had to carefully plan
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   around that and make sure
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   that you could afford the COBRA coverage.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Even still, even though we can ignore the pre-existing
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   conditions, that doesn't help if you have a medical condition
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and you can't afford the premiums for the COBRA
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   coverage. You need to recognize what
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   those costs would be and account for them in your
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   emergency savings.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Many times
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   people will say, "I've got a three-month
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   emergency fund," but they haven't
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   accounted for that, the cost of
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   health insurance.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   For most people, the cost of basic individual
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   health insurance has substantially
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   increased in the last few years.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   That can be a real challenge to work into your
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   budget. So don't worry
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   too much about the details here. Just recognize
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   that you are going to need to come up with some cash
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   to pick up some health insurance premiums.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   What about life insurance?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   That one's more problematic
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   because you might be forced
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   out of your group life insurance and not be able
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   to get any more. So if you're
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   depending on your group life insurance plan
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   for your family's
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   needs, and if
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   you're healthy enough to get an individual policy,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   do that now. Follow
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   through now and shop and see if you can
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   get one. If you're not healthy
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   enough, at least take a look at what
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   the terms are for that group life
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   insurance plan and know in advance
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   what would happen if you got laid
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   off. Sometimes they are
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   most of the time they are convertible
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   from a term life insurance policy to a
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   whole life insurance policy, but most
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   of the time you won't be able to afford that
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   massive increase in premiums.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Sometimes you can continue them as term
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   insurance coverage, you just need to review the terms of your
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   policies. Would you lose
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   your disability income insurance?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   That one's trickier because there
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   are pros and cons to both sides of
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   owning disability insurance through your job
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   versus other places, so we'll cover that
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   in detail when we do disability insurance in the future,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   but at least understand what your coverage
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   transfer options are. It's really not that
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   tough. Get a copy of your group benefits
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   program and read it.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Call up your HR coordinator and ask them.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Find out or think
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   through what would happen to your pension accounts.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   For most people now who are covered
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   by some system
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   of a 401(k), it's pretty simple.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   They're pretty simple to transfer.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   If you have a defined benefit pension, those are less
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   simple. There's not
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   a lot that you can do here to change it,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   but at least have a general idea of what would happen.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   One of the things that I forgot about when I was
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   laid off back in 2008 was that I
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   wasn't fully vested in my 401(k)s
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   employer contributions,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   so I forfeited the employer
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   contributions because I wasn't fully vested.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Now, there wasn't a lot I could do about
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   that, but it did impact my financial
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   life.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Give these things some thought, and if you see
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   any holes or any problems in
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   your plan, then start
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   affecting them and start plugging the holes.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Now, overall,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   the major thing to focus on,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   and here's where we get out of the
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   specific weeds of finance,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   the major things to focus on is
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   the plan of getting
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   your next job as quickly as possible.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   There are a few things that you
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   can be doing to prepare for that.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Now, many of these things are things
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   you should be doing anyway so that you don't get
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   laid off. That's the beauty about this
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   way of thinking, like I emphasized yesterday.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   All of those things that I mentioned in yesterday's
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   show will help you to keep from getting
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   laid off, but they'll also make you more employable
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   and improve your
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   chances of getting another job.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Have you ever noticed how the people
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   for whom things go well, it seems like things
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   always go well and they always get more and more
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   opportunities? And then some people
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   it seems like nothing seems to go well, nothing
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   seems to go well, nothing seems to go well, and it
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   just gets worse and worse?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Now, there may be many reasons for that. Some of those
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   things are within their control, and some
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   of those things are outside of their control.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   But, you can
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   tilt the odds in your favor
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   with good, proper, prior
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   planning.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   And, this
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   type of approach will help you
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   from getting laid off, because you should
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   be looking for your next job or next opportunity
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   regardless. Not necessarily
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   actively all the time out
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   beating the streets and applying for jobs,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   but keeping your ears open.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   One of the key things you can do is
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   keep yourself light and
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   flexible financially.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Simple example, one of the
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   benefits to renting is
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   you can move across the country or
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   across the world on relatively
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   short notice.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   One of the biggest challenges
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   of 2008 and 2009,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   which were the most recent recessions
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   that are
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   fresh in our memory,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   was not necessarily that there were no jobs,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   but that the jobs
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   were in a place that was different than
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   many of the workers. But, many of the
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   workers were stuck in the
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   old place without the job,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   because they couldn't sell their house.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   And, as each phase of the financial
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   crisis continued on,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   each prior phase
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   just exacerbated the problem for
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   the next phase. And so,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   more and more people are upside down on their properties,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   their property values are falling, they're
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   losing their jobs, more and more supplies
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   coming on the market, prices are being
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   pressed down, and now
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   fewer people can afford to move because they can't
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   get out of their house. Finally, they say, "I've got
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   to move." They get out of their house, it goes into
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   foreclosure, the bank takes out the property,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   it depresses the price still further, and it's just this
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   never-ending cycle, is what it felt like.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Simple example,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   if you're light and flexible financially,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   if you're renting, you can just move
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   across the country or world. You put in your
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   notice if you need to.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Most people, if you're on a lease,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   you're rarely ever more than 12 months away
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   from the end of a lease, and probably
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   you would have some indication
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   right before you signed your 12-month
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   lease, so you're probably six months or so
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   away. And, if you need to break the lease,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   the penalties are usually less
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   severe than
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   trying to sell your house when it's
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   underwater.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   So, even the financial things
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   and the financial decisions can tie into
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   getting that next job as quickly as possible.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Do a good
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   job right where you are today,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   and if you
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   do that consistently over time, then you'll
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   always be able to go back to a previous job if you need
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   one. Oftentimes,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   the best people to hire you, if or when you
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   need it in a hurry, are going to be
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   previous employers who were happy with your
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   work. I proved
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   this myself when I was in high
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   school or college, but at
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   one point, I got laid off from a print shop.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   I had agreed to start working with a print shop,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   and it was a bad deal. We had bad
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   communication when coming
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   in, and I was coming in under the
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   understanding that I was
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   coming in as basically a small
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   time business consultant, and
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   my employer thought I was coming
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   in as a front
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   desk worker. Now, I don't know how we
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   got such bad communication.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   It should have been obvious, but it was pretty
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   obvious within a couple of weeks that it wasn't
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   a great fit, and so
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   a few weeks into it, all of a sudden, we realized
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   this isn't working, and both of us mutually
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   agreed to call it off. So, as I left
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   that job, I needed a job, and as
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   I left that job, I called a previous employer
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   and actually drove from getting
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   laid off to the other employer,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   and they hired me on the spot for the rest
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   of the summer. Another
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   time, when I got back from
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   studying abroad, I needed work. I had decided to
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   drop out of college at that time, and I needed work,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   and I called a former employer, and I said,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   "I need work," and he said, "Well, give me a couple days." A couple
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   days later, he said, "I've got a project. Here's the project.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Here's what I can offer you," and it worked out,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   and especially in
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   the younger years, encourage your children
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   to just do
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   a good job because those
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   times, I really needed those jobs.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   That wasn't $200,000 a year
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   for a finance professional job. That's different,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   but still, when you need a job, you need
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   a job, and it makes a big difference.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   In my mind,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   one of the biggest things that can be helpful
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   as you make plans of what you
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   would do in case you get laid off
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   is to see yourself now
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   as a business owner
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   because, practically
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   speaking, you are a
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   business owner.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   You are the president of your own
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   personal services corporation.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   At the moment,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   you just simply happen to have one
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   customer who is your best customer,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   and that customer is
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   your current employer.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   But like every business
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   owner, you're always looking for
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   more customers and better customers.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   So,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   you're looking to serve your current
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   customer better, which is
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   what we talked about yesterday, and you're
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   keeping your eyes and ears open for
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   how you can attract to yourself
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   more and better
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   customers. And when you find
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   a better customer than your current
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   customer, you're going to transition over
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   to them. That's called switching jobs.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   So, there are
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   a lot of simple things that you can do if you
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   put that mindset
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   on. If you see yourself
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   as a business owner, you start
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   by just simply paying attention to what the overall
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   goals are of your personal services
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   corporation. Why does your business
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   exist? Well, it exists
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   to fund the lifestyle of the owner, right?
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   And to fulfill the goals of the owner.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   So, this connects directly back to
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   what we always talk about is jobs and
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   work and businesses are a way of funding our ideal
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   lifestyle. So, that's why your business exists.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   So, you should be constantly
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   thinking about what those goals are and how
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   to most effectively reach them.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   You want to keep a list of
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   other potential customers
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   that you might be interested in serving.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   If you
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   have a list of other
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   customers, other potential employers
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   or other areas of the market,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   other industries you're interested in,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   then if you
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   get laid off, you can go to that list
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   and quickly move into another
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   business sector.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   So, very practically,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   keep a list of jobs or businesses
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   that you're interested in. I've
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   told this before on the show, but I went and
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   looked it up and this was something that
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   I've done over time and it helped me
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   immeasurably when I was laid off in 2008.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   I had maintained a list
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   of jobs and businesses that
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   seemed fun to me. Anything that
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   just struck me as, "Wow, that would be fun."
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Now, I think when I've told this story
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   on the show before, I've said that there were
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   150 things on that list. I thought
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   there were, but just for fun as I was
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   preparing this
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   outline for today's show, I went
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   and looked at the spreadsheet.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   On that time, I was keeping it in a simple
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Google spreadsheet, so everything that you do
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   on the internet lasts forever.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   I was able to find it and
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   that was convenient for me
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   as a way to record it. Since then, I do a lot
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   of stuff just in notebooks.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   One of the things I looked when I looked at the
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   spreadsheet, I realized I hadn't touched it since 2008,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   since I was laid off.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   So, I stopped filling this one in,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   even though I have other lists.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   So, I went and found it and I
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   had to laugh when I
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   read it. I went and got my
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   wife and I said, "Look, you've got to see this."
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   I explained to her the history of this spreadsheet
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   and she laughed as well.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   So, listen to some of these ideas
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   and I'm just sharing this as a simple
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   encouragement, not to be
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   too focused on me, but just
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   listen to some of these ideas.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   They're very, very informal.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   It's just me jotting down ideas that
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   stand out to me, but listen to
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   the themes here.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   The reason I laughed is because
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   I see all of these themes still in my
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   life, seven years later,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   of each of the transitions that I've personally made.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Here are just a few.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   I'd like to market a study abroad
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   program. I'd like to be a
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   freelance copywriter. I'd like
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   to be a financial consultant or advisor.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   I'd like to be a motivational
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   speaker. I could be an
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   organization or decluttering
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   consultant. The business could be
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   called Simple. I'd be your simple
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Sherpa, your guide to a simple life.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Clean and refresh. I could help
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   people make a clean sweep journal. That was one
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   of the ideas that I had in the past.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   I could create and sell an "I wish I had
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   known" e-book. Sell it on the internet.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   For example, I wish I'd known
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   how to live in my car. I could
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   start a roof cleaning business.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   I'd be passionate about working for Metro
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   PCS. That was my idea back then.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   I could own or work in a cigar
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   shop or be a cigar writer.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   I could work for Early to Rise in
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Boca Raton. That was a financial newsletter I used to
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   read every day, and their offices
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   were near me. I could write a financial
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   course for college students.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Making speeches is what I'd do.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   I could travel the world as an international
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   trainer and speaker. I could
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   create a magazine for adventure motorcycle
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   travel. I could work
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   as an account representative at a local staffing
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   company, the one that was at my company
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   at that time. That would allow me to speak to people.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   I could work as a local trainer for a local
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   consulting business. I could teach
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   in a high school. Develop and run
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   a property management company.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   I could create positive motivational helmet
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   stickers for motorcyclists.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I don't know if any of you pay attention. You see these guys,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   the Harley riders usually, and they
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   got the black motorcycle helmet,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   and they're just these most cynical, disgusting stickers
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   usually. I thought, "I wonder if there's a market
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   for positive, motivational, uplifting
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   ones." I could read and
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   create audio books
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   in English and Spanish.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   I could do sales for a local
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   motivational speaker or company.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   I could be a commercial real estate developer.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   I could start dumpsterlist.com.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Everyone's trash is
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   someone else's treasure. I could be
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   an Allstate agent or other kind of insurance
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   agent. I could sell financial
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   products. I had some listed here
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   of how I came across
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   a financial company. I could be a
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   recruiter. I knew a recruiter, and I decided I'd
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   talk to them. I could do sales for a car
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   dealership, any kind of sales job.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   I could sell clothes for big men.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   I could become an expert on human body language
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   or face language.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   How about an information publishing idea? I could publish
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   informational products in the art of mind reading.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   I could write a bestselling book.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Be a coach, a personal
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   coach, a life coach, a money coach.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   I could be an interior decorator.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   I could start a website dedicated to high mileage
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   cars. I could start the
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   success channel for satellite radio.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   I could write an e-book called "Teach Your Child
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   to Be Rich." I could be a sports
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   announcer. That's just some of the
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   70 things. The reason I
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   do that, I hope it's
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   not too personal. It is a little bit personal.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Those are just my silly ideas.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   One of the things that I laugh at is I see
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   every one of those themes reflected in Radical
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Personal Finance. The MetroPCS
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   thing was at that time, MetroPCS
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   was the only company that offered
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   just a flat rate service for cell
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   phones with unlimited
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   access. I hated the
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   AT&Ts and the T-Mobiles that were popular
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   back then. I was like, "No, I could go
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   and do sales for them because that's a model that I like."
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   What do you see in Radical Personal
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Finance? You see a show on how to
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   live a good deal on your cell phone plans
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   or how to live in your car.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Even at that time, I was interested in all these weird things
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   that most people aren't. Or organizational
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   decluttering consultants, so I bring on
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   minimalists onto the show.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Working and starting and running study abroad
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   programs, that's why I bring on so many people
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   with international travel and extol
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   the virtues of that. That's
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   personal to me, but
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   if you have a similar list, then
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   what it allows you to look at,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   and at that time, this was the list that I worked from
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   and wound up becoming a financial advisor
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   because I'd known a few people. The Allstate
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   thing, for example, I had a friend of mine
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   who was an upper-level Allstate
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   rep, and I was like, "That seems pretty cool."
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Ultimately, that wasn't a good
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   fit, but I see the themes now.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Just simply by writing down
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   any time you have an idea of
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   "There's a job I'd like to have. There's a business
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   I'd like to do," then you'll create
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   listings and you'll have a place to start from because
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   in tomorrow's show, I'm going to go through,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   "Okay, you got laid off.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   What do you want?" One of the key points
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   of that show is
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   knowing what you want.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   It's impossible to find a job if you don't know
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   what you want, but it's hard to do
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   when you're under pressure and you've got to feed your family.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Now is the time to make
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   the plan and just keep those notes.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Write down those ideas
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   and look at them from time to time
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   and try to see how are
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   they connected? What's
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   consistent about them?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   That'll help it
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   because I try to help my friends find
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   jobs and they come to me and say, "I need work."
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   I'm like, "Okay, what do you want to do?" "I don't know. I just
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   need a job." That is an impossible
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   question to answer. I've never been able
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   to help a single person in that situation, but if they say,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   "Well, I'm actually interested
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   in the idea of
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   selling. I like to sell."
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   "Okay, what kind of things?" "I also like cars."
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   "Great. Now, pick up the phone.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   Here, call this person, this person, this person."
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   You've got to know
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   what you're trying to do.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   Compare it to sales. The essence
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   of professional selling
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   is to figure out what your product
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   is and then figure out
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   who's the right customer for that
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   product and then you figure out
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   how to reach them.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   In finding a job, you need to figure out
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   what your product is,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   what types of services
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   does your personal services corporation
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   offer, who would be
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   the right fit for those types
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   of services, and then making
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   the connection is easy.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   So, simple
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   thing you can do now to prepare to be laid off
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   is keep lists of
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   future goals, future ideas,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   future businesses, future jobs.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Keep lists of what you think
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   your skills are. It's a lot easier
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   to sit down and write your resume if you
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   have a list of all
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   of the skills that you think you
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   have. Keep a list of
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   companies you admire. If you hear of a
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   job that sounds fun, write it down.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   If you have certain hobbies that
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   you're interested in, write them down.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   Look for ways if you hear of somebody making
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   a little bit of money on them, look for ways.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Overall,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   start thinking like an independent
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   consultant. And here I'm just
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   expanding the theme,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   the concept of running your own
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   personal services corporation. Think like a consultant
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   and recognize
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   that you need to establish your brand
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   in the industry, whatever
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   that industry is.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Whether or not your company approves
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   and pays for it or whether you need to do it,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   get out there within your industry.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Go to the conferences, read the books, the blogs,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   the trade journals, the articles.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   Look for what the other companies are doing and
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   keep current on them. Expand
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   your brand by volunteering
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   to teach a class at a local university
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   or write columns for your
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   industry trade journals. Focus
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   on building your reputation as an
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   individual, as an independent consultant.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   Of course, you need to
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   promote your business because they're your
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   best customer, but that's what you would be doing if you were
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   a consultant.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Build your own reputation, especially
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   online. That was one of my major frustrations
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   with the large corporate
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   financial services companies is
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   you spend all your time building their reputation
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   and not your own. Focus
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   on enhancing your marketing
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   skills. What's
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   going to make you stand out as a consultant?
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Are
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   there designations, credentials,
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   certain types of education that
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   you need? Simple example.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   Again, just
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   speaking from what I've experienced. Simple example
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   of financial credentials.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   I don't put a lot of stock into
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   necessarily all of the academic
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   importance of
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   education. Education
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   is education and it's vital
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   whether or not it's related to academia.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   But if there are things like credentials
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   or designations in the financial business that you
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   can get, get them.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Because here's the thing.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   My name looks a little bit ridiculous
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   as far as all of the
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   credentials, but
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   if I were applying for a job
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   as a financial advisor, just
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   purely on the worst way possible
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   off of a resume,
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   automatically my resume goes to the
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   top of the chart or to the top of the
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   stack. Now the cool thing is
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   I don't ever plan
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   to do that, but all of those things help
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   me to do a better job now for my
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   existing clients that I'm never in that situation.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   So whatever it is in your
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   industry, take that and look for it.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   If it's designations or credentials
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   or a degree or a certain type of
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   education, get it.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   And whether that's formal,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   you need an MBA, you need another
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   advanced specialization,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   do that stuff.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   Or whether it's less formal,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   starting a website where
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   you talk just about your
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   business, where you review all the books
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   in your business, and you've established
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   the industry blog or the industry podcast,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   that will help
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   not only your current
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   company, but also
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   helps your resume float to the top
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   of the stack.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   Every industry needs
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   this type of work.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   It will help you now,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   it'll help your current
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   company, but it'll also open up
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   opportunities for you.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   And the vast majority
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   of us need to be building a public
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   platform
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   for a few reasons.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   Again, planning to be laid off.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   If you build a public platform
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   for your voice and your content,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   you're creating leverage for yourself,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   both positive net leverage
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   and potential
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   negative leverage in this sense.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   Positively, you're going to be
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   viewed as an asset
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   to your company, because
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   after all, you're a consultant
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   to your company. You're a personal services
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   corporation, and they're your best client.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   And so, as part of your work as a
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   consultant, you're going to be helping to
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   build their reputation and their brand.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   But, as
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   far as the potential negative sanction,
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   is negatively,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   you're going to have a little bit
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   of leverage. You're going to be viewed as having
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   a voice and a platform, and
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   the employer is going to treat you
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   carefully.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   Doesn't mean you won't get laid off,
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   but it at least
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   improves your chances of not getting laid
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   off, and
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   it helps a little bit
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   with your leverage.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   You need an independent communication
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   system,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   and that helps you in your industry.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   So, it's a win-win-win.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   If you're in the right industry
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   and your company is laying you off, and
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   you're established as a voice,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   all you do is just put out a notice, and
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   your competitors will hire you right up.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   And, that'll probably
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   happen before the layoffs if you're smart.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   Because,
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   the fact that you are a public figure,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   knowing what's going on in your industry is going to
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   help information flow to you,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   and you're going to be ahead a little
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   bit of everybody else.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   And then, even if your whole industry goes
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   down and you need to pivot to a new industry,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   then your expertise and your platform
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   is going to give you a solid place to work from.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   So,
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   consider that. Build your
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   platform before you need it. Think like a consultant.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   Next,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   build and maintain your network
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   in an organized, systematic
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   way.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Be proactive about this.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   Harvey McKay wrote a great book. It's called, "Dig
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Your Well Before You're Thirsty."
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   The time to build a network is before you need it.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   So, be proactive about it.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Another great book by a guy named Keith
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   Ferrazzi, years ago. These books are old,
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   old. But, he wrote a book called, "Never
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   Eat Alone." And, if you want to talk about
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   proactive networking, the book is
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   just as relevant as it used to be.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   Go and find Keith Ferrazzi's book, "Never Eat Alone."
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   But, just the simple stuff.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   Keep contact information.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Save the contact
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   information of all of your current
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   fellow employees. Take the company
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   list home. Make sure you have
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   that information, because you never know if you need to get
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   in touch with somebody.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   If you move from one place to another, you need
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   that, in the old days, the Rolodex,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   today, the contact book.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   If you keep all of your contacts on your
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   company's cell phone, and they're not backed up,
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   and you get laid off, and your company's cell phone
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   goes away,
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   not smart.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   This is, again,
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   probably too focused on me, but
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   just as an example, I can only speak from
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   experience. I haven't lost, I don't think I've lost contact
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   information for anyone I've met since I was about 18.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   Because, I was
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   obsessive compulsive about this,
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   because I was reading all the business books, and I knew I needed
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   to do it, and so I share that with you.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   Because of that,
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   I was able to have all kinds of people's information.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   Now, that doesn't mean I have a relationship with them,
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   but at least I have a name and a number.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   I could go, and if you say, "Well, Joshua,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   you're going to Canada."
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   Okay, and I can go, and I can search my database
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   for who do I know in Canada.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   And I could come up with, you know, it comes to me right now,
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   I could come up with a name and number of
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   the couple that I met in Colombia,
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   that I had dinner with one night there,
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   that I met at a hostel, and they had spent
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   their time driving around Central
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   and South America for
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   about a year, and we had a great time,
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   and they invited me to come see them in Canada.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   I could go find that info.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   And so, when I got started
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   in sales and financial
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   advice, that helped me
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   immeasurably.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   Because instead of sitting there and saying, "Well, I know
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   100 people that I'm going to call on, and I'm going to sit there
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   and cold call out of the phone book,"
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   I was able to make hundreds and hundreds
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   and hundreds of phone calls.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   And if worse came to worse,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   I had to do it again, and my family were starving,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   I'd go get a network marketing gig
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   of a business or a product that I believed
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   in, and I've got those hundreds of people
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   that I could reach out to.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   Now, I don't want to do that, but
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   it's a backup plan.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   So something as simple as keeping your contact
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   information and keeping it organized
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   is incredibly valuable. And the higher you go,
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   you'll notice that the network,
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   the contact information,
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   the ability to get through to the people that matter
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   is one of the biggest deals.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   And you've got to build that proactively.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   Focus on helping people.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Add value constantly.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   It's not slimy, it's not
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   self-seeking. The key
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   is add value. The key is help.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Build a local
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   group, a local support group, or a
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   mastermind group, or people that you're connected with.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   Just the guys or gals
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   you have breakfast with or drinks with every Thursday.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Volunteer
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   in the local organizations.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   Pretend that you move to a new town
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   and you don't know a soul. What would you do?
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   Well, you'd get involved.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   So, get involved.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   Build the network.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   Look to help people.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   To advance people.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   And then, if you're ever thirsty,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   because you got laid off,
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   your well will be
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   dug.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   But you've got to do it now.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   Make the plan now.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   Be recruitable. Take the calls that you get from recruiters.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   Depending on your type of industry, you may or may not get this.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   But take the calls and save the recruiters'
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   contact information. Keep a special file.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   And in the tomorrow's show, you'll see why that's important.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   In addition,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   consider having a backup
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   side business.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   Here's the thing. Let's say
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   that you were a business consultant.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   And you came in and you are
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   consulting Joshua Sheets
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   on his business. And Joshua
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   tells you, "Hey, you know,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   Mr. and Mrs. Consultant,
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   thank you so much for coming in.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   The reality is
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   I have one really great customer
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   for my business. This really
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   great customer is, I don't know,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   Acme Corporation.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   And Acme Corporation
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   is my number one customer.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   They pay me $100,000 a year."
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   And you say, "Well, do you have
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   any other customers?" "No, no. Just
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   Acme Corporation."
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   "What if you lose Acme Corporation?"
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   "Well, I'd be
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   down to nothing."
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   And that's the problem that every
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   single one of us who are
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   employees faces.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   People talk about risk.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   This is one of the things most entrepreneurs think about.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   Most entrepreneurs,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   if they woke up and only had one customer, that would make
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   them sweat.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   That would be a real problem for me.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   I wouldn't want to face that situation. Now, you might
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   do it for a time, but you'd
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   be aware of it and you'd be working to build
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   things like I'm talking about
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   as backup.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   I prefer to have hundreds of customers.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   Right now,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   on Radical Personal Finance, I've got 175
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   customers.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   And
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   I see those 175 customers
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   are paying me $1,747.50 a month.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   So if 10 people get mad at me and leave,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   stop being my customers,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   I'm in a much better shape
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   than if I had one.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   Think about it.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   But don't just think about it,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   work on it.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   Build a little side hustle. Build a little side business.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   In yesterday's show, I talked about
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   working and working a lot of hours.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   In my mind, this is a double-edged
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   sword. You've got to be careful here.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   If your best potential
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   is at your company,
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   and if you're really connected to it,
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   then I think you're probably going to be
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   well-served by really focusing your
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   time and efforts on that company.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   Because there should be, if there are
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   opportunities for advancement, if you have
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   the ability to work effectively,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   if you have the opportunity to move into the upper levels
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   in your company, in your industry,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   then focus
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   and specialization is really, really key.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   And we only have
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   168 hours in a week, and there's got to be a balance
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   between all of the demands of life.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   So it might
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   pay you to focus on
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   working exclusively
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   with this company and really helping it advance.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   And especially as time, as you
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   move up the ranks, the CEO
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   of Walmart is not working a little
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   side hustle. Walmart is their
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   deal. They've got to spend all their time
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   on that. And the higher you go in
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   corporate management or the higher you go in
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   a company, the more
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   time and the more focus and the more energy
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   is going to be devoted to that one
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   specific company.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   But many of you listening are not in that
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   type of upper level situation. And if
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   you're not, or if you don't want to be,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   for example, my company
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   or my industry, it's okay,
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   I've got a job, but it's just a job. It's a
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   J-O-B. I'm ready
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   to work hard, but they don't treat me
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   very well. Be careful, but
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   sometimes it actually is true. Or
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   there's not a lot of opportunity for advancement,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   or you know what, I just don't really care that much. Okay,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   fine. It's your life.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   But make sure you're putting in time on a
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   backup business or a side business.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Don't spend all of your
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   time working for one company unless you've
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   got major incentive to really
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   shine there.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   Try to bring on a second customer or
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   a few extra customers.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   Having something on the side will help you
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   if you get laid off.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   Finally, spend some
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   time now thinking through and studying
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   how to get a job. Study
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   resume writing or job finding. Flip
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   through a career book from time to time. Keep things
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   apparent. I'm not saying
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   I don't keep my resume up to date, but
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   it might be a good idea if you think you need to
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   if you're sending it out to recruiters.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   And just a simple thing like
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   keeping good records on your accomplishments.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   This one I struggle with.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   I don't pay much attention to this stuff.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   And then you go to write down the fancy
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   brochure and it's like, "I don't know what I did.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   I don't know who I joined or what awards
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   I won." So just
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   something simple like keeping records of your
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   accomplishments will make it easier in the future
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   for you to produce a resume
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   or to update it. Keep
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   track of dates. Have a calendaring system
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   where you can know, "Okay, I started
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   this job here and I left this job there."
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   Very simple,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   but it matters.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   And you'll see in tomorrow's show
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   how it matters.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   Hope this has been useful for you.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   I'm doing
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   my best. It's kind of
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   out of my head as far as how I think about
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   this stuff. I've never really heard anybody else talk about it
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   so I'd be happy to have your
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   feedback if this is useful.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   Hopefully you'll see the
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   connectedness but also the
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   distinctions between all these different steps.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   And I believe that
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   evidence will show this out.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   I watch some people and it's like they've got the golden
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   touch. You look at them
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   and you say, "What do they do?" Well, they do these
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   kinds of things. And they don't
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   ever get laid off because they're the ones
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   who are in charge of laying people
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   off. Well, you don't start
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   there. So you've got to do all the stuff in yesterday's show
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   to build up.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   And while you're getting to the position of where you're the
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   one in charge of making the layoff decision, which is the
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   far worst position to be in, I'm
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   convinced. I do not envy people
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   who have to lay employees
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   off. That's a heavy thing to do.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   But while you're working your way up, you need to have these plans
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   in place. And then
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   all of these ideas fit together
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   and tomorrow I'm going to talk about how to
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   find a job. And again, remember
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   that one of the great ways to avoid getting laid off
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   is to be looking for a job in advance. And so
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   all the things that I'm going to talk about tomorrow
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   will fit together and
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   fit into this content of this
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   show. And you can get a job now
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   or you can get a job if
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   you get laid off. So I hope this is
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   helpful to you. Thank you so much for listening to
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   today's show. Thank you for those of you who support
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   the show, the 175 of you.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   If you would like to help
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   me grow that number to 176,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   I would be grateful
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   to you. I'm doing my
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   best to be a good employee for you.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   Working hard for you, doing everything I can
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   to bring you all the ideas that I believe
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   are important. And I leave
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   you in the judge's seat.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   You can judge whether it's worthy or not.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   But if you find my work to be helpful,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   if you find it to be compelling,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   please go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   and you
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   can put a little number in a box and you can
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   become a patron. The lowest number
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   is a buck a month. So if you think
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   Joshua's doing a good job and he's a good employee
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   at a buck a month, that'd be great.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   If you want to put in 500 bucks a month because
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   I'm doing a good job for you, you can put that
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   number in there as well. Radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   and I'll be back with you all tomorrow.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   Thank you so much.

[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   enlightenment, but your
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   situation is unique and I cannot
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   deliver any actionable advice
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   without knowing anything about you.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   Please, develop a team of

[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   to be caring, competent,
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   and trustworthy, and consult
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   them, because they are the ones
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   who can understand your specific needs,
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   your specific goals,
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   and provide specific answers to
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   your questions. I've done my
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   absolute best to be clear and accurate
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   in today's show, but I'm one person
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   and I make mistakes.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said,
