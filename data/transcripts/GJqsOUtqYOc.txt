[00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.400]   so you you're under homeland security i was recently watching an interview by joe rogan
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.360]   actually and he was talking about how homeland security is the team that invaded diddy's house
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.640]   yes do you have any knowledge on like why they went to his house and invaded it and do you have
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.520]   any knowledge on that situation i i have no direct knowledge of the investigation so i have not taken
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.880]   a part in it and if i had uh i would not be able to say it because it's an ongoing criminal
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.720]   investigation which right um so but what i can say is that i believe it involved sex trafficking
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:52.320]   uh of minors um that the reason it seemed like an overwhelming response to search a search warrant
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.040]   like why are you bringing um deals with kind of the people he has around protecting you know him
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.080]   and his property um you know their criminal histories things like that so you know if
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.680]   you have a security guard that you know has a previous homicide conviction and he's armed well
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.440]   the cops are going to treat your the search warrant in a different way um i can tell you that
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:24.320]   the level of probable cause that would go into getting the higher executives at homeland security
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.360]   had to sign off on that uh judge had to sign off on that the prosecutor's office had to sign off on that
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.200]   and knowing that it would be someone you know that's going to be high profile it's going to be able to
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.440]   hire 20 defense attorneys to try to pick everything apart yeah that it it would have to be a pretty solid
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.320]   affidavit and allegation for them to even go after like that yeah so the idea of hollywood and kind of these um
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:58.400]   um these people with these pedophilia rings and things like that um and that that truly takes
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.280]   place you know you got the jeffrey epstein case what are your thoughts on kind of the because that also
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.440]   is kind of a conspiracy that people think that kind of these higher up people are involved in these
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.480]   pedophilia rings and then you know you have the jeffrey epstein case and kind of the defendants in his case
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.000]   um which were a lot of really well-known individuals and things like that like what are your thoughts
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.600]   on that oh there's corruption like i have no doubt about that that that case is just wrought with
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:34.480]   problems like yeah uh like i had no involvement in it none whatsoever but but you've seen enough to
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.800]   know that that's yeah it stinks like yeah my question is this how do you charge jelaine maxwell
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:52.000]   in human trafficking when you can't prove who she trafficked a human to you have to have an end user
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.240]   right yeah to follow this right yeah so if i was going to sell drugs you would have to prove that i sold
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.560]   them to a person right yeah so if i'm going to traffic a person you'd have to prove that i sold it to a person
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.680]   yeah what in any documents came out of who these kids were trafficked to so you say you think it's
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.200]   false no i think they absolutely traffic kids and i think that there's oh you're saying the people on
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.560]   the receiving end that's the people we need to be going after yes yes the people who are having
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.960]   sex with the 14 year olds or the 16 year olds paying for it flying to an island like to to cross
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.200]   out of our country with the intent to have sex with a child is a felony you're going to do 10 years yeah
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.360]   like do you is the idea that there's these very powerful people whether it's politicians whether it's
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.040]   um hollywood movie stars or you know different people of that caliber that are really into this type
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:58.160]   of stuff do you do you think that to be the case i don't think so uh so i think that there is like
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:07.040]   true pedophilia so is prepubescent right that's 11 or under and i think most of the people in the epstein
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.880]   case the p diddy case you know whatever are probably going to be in that 14 to 18 range which is more
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.160]   called hebophilia um that somebody after the onset of puberty but still a child um so i think that's
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.880]   in those circles what the the problem or what their focus is what they're trying to get access to
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:38.000]   um and and i think in in the actual pedophilia the raping of children is a completely different thing
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.840]   and i don't think there are big rings where that's happening where people are are trafficking in two
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.680]   year olds or one month olds or those kind of things right okay so um because i actually you know just
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.120]   being around i i kind of think the opposite i kind of think there are a lot of people that you would
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.920]   never suspect and they're powerful people that have a great background and they would come off as super
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.280]   clean cut or whatever but on the side they're involved in some crazy things ryan garcia the
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.480]   boxer recently came out and talked about um how the bohemian grove i don't know if you know what that
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.760]   is i don't um it's basically yeah he said he was brought into the woods as um and and forced to watch
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.120]   you know some people might call him crazy whatever the bohemian grove is a real place um and kind of
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.480]   forced to watch you know people partake in you know this type of stuff with with children
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.680]   and he said himself he was he was raped as a young child um but i think it's interesting talking to
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.840]   someone who works certain of these cases and i don't know if it's that these people are so high up and so
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.200]   protected that they get away with it and you know the people that are kind of messy with it and the
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.560]   ones that are kind of like um leave too many things behind are the ones that get caught but i kind of
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.960]   of think it goes a lot higher and deeper than people suspect.
