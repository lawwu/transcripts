[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   So you you're under Homeland Security I was recently watching an interview by
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.640]   Joe Rogan actually and he was talking about how Homeland Security is the team
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.520]   that invaded Diddy's house. Yes. Do you have any knowledge on like why they went
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.320]   to his house and invaded it and do you have any knowledge on that situation? I
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.920]   have no direct knowledge of the investigation so I have not taken a part
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.400]   in it and if I had I would not be able to say it because it's an ongoing
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.240]   criminal investigation which right so but what I can say is that I believe it
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:49.680]   involved sex trafficking of minors that the reason it seemed like an
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.040]   overwhelming response to search a search warrant like why you bring deals with
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.040]   kind of the people he has around protecting you know him and his property
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.440]   you know their criminal histories things like that so you know if you have a
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.800]   security guard that you know has a previous homicide conviction and he's
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.760]   armed well the cops are going to treat your the search warrant in a different
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:21.880]   way I can tell you that the level of probable cost that would go into getting
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.200]   the higher executives at Homeland Security had to sign off on that judge
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.160]   had to sign off on that the prosecutor's office had to sign off on that and
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.320]   knowing that it would be someone you know that's gonna be high-profile it's
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.360]   gonna be able to hire 20 defense attorneys to try to pick everything
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.880]   apart yeah that it it would have to be a pretty solid affidavit and allegation
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.440]   for them to even go out yeah yeah so the idea of Hollywood and kind of these
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.080]   these people with these pedophilia rings and things like that and that that truly
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.840]   takes place you know you got the Jeffrey Epstein case what are your thoughts on
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.720]   kind of the because that also is kind of a conspiracy that people think that kind
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.880]   of these higher-up people are involved in these pedophilia rings and then you
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.600]   know you got the Jeffrey Epstein case and kind of the defendants in his case
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.000]   which were a lot of really well-known individuals and things like that like
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.280]   what are your thoughts on that oh there's corruption like I have no doubt
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.080]   about that that that case is just wrought with problems like yeah like I
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.880]   had no involvement in it none whatsoever but you've seen enough to know that
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.440]   that's yeah it stinks like yeah they my question is this how do you charge
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.160]   Jelaine Maxwell in human trafficking when you can't prove who she trafficked
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.920]   a human - you have to have an end-user right yeah to follow this right yeah so
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.000]   if I was gonna sell drugs you would have to prove that I sold them to a person
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.200]   right yeah so I'm gonna traffic a person you'd have to prove that I sold it to a
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.120]   person yeah what in any documents came out of who these kids were trafficked to
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.480]   so you say you think it's false no I think they absolutely traffic here and I
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.120]   think that there's oh you're saying the people on the receiving end that's the
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.160]   people we need to be going after yes yes the people who are having sex with the
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.520]   fourteen-year-olds or the sixteen-year-olds right for flying to an
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.000]   island like to cook to cross out of our country with the intent to have sex with
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.720]   his child is a felony you're gonna do ten years yeah like do you is the idea
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.920]   that there's these very powerful people whether it's politicians whether it's
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.680]   Hollywood movie stars or you know different people of that caliber that
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.520]   are really into this type of stuff do you do you think that to be the case I
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:02.440]   don't think so so I think that there is like true pedophilia so is prepubescent
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.280]   right that's 11 or under and I think most of the people in the Epstein case
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.920]   the P Diddy case you know whatever are probably gonna be in that 14 to 18 range
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.640]   which is more called hemophilia that somebody after the onset of puberty but
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.760]   still a child so I think that's in those circles what the the problem or what
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:34.560]   their focus is what they're trying to get access to and and I think in the
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.280]   actual pedophilia the raping of children is a completely different thing and I
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   don't think there are big rings where that's happening where people are are
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.160]   trafficking in two-year-olds or one-month-olds or those kind of things
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.600]   right okay so um because I actually you know just being around I I kind of think
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.440]   the opposite I kind of think there are a lot of people that you would never
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.880]   suspect and they're powerful people that have a great background and they will
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.240]   come off as super clean-cut or whatever but on the side they're involved in some
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.840]   crazy things Ryan Garcia the boxer recently came out and talked about how
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.720]   the Bohemian Grove I don't know if you know what that is
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.440]   it's basically yeah he said he was brought into the woods as and forced to
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.520]   watch you know some people might call him crazy whatever the Bohemian Grove is
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.280]   a real place and kind of forced to watch you know people partake in you know this
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.080]   type of stuff with with children and he said himself he was he was raped as a
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.440]   young child but I think it's interesting talking to someone who works certain of
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.180]   these cases and I don't know if it's that these people are so high up and so
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.280]   protected that they get away with it and you know the people that are kind of
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.040]   messy with it and the ones that are kind of like leave too many things behind are
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.640]   the ones that get caught but I kind of think it goes a lot higher and deeper
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.800]   than people suspect
