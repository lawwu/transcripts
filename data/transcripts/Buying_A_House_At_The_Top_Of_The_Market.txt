[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.120]   Buying a home at the top of the market. What if you do that?
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.120]   What if you buy a home in 2021 or 2022?
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.180]   When home prices are at all-time highs and then the economy rolls over you just never know
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.580]   I mean how many of us could have anticipated a black swan event like the pandemic?
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.960]   Locking us up for a year or a year and a half, right? You just never know when it comes to
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.520]   Investing in any risk asset with no guaranteed returns
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.160]   So if you're thinking about buying a home today
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.200]   Then you also need to envision a scenario where you buy a home at the top of the market and you make no money
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.740]   Or you actually lose money. It's not a good feeling and it's something that I went through back in 2007
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.480]   I bought a vacation condo in Lake Tahoe
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.920]   Because I thought hey my income was gonna keep on going up. I had recently been promoted to vice president
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.120]   I got a nice salary bump and a nice bonus. So I was thinking to myself why not live it up?
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.300]   Why not live it up and buy a place where I first took my wife on her first date in California back in?
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.880]   2000 the other thing was that I got a good deal or so I thought
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.000]   previously the condo sold for
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.520]   800 I think about
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.000]   $820,000 and I was able to buy it for
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.960]   $2,000 I believe but as we all know
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.160]   2008 and 2009 came and everything went to hell
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.880]   so my bonuses got slashed tons of people got laid off in the finance industry and
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.520]   The property ultimately lost about 50% of its value went from seven hundred
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.320]   You know fifteen thousand dollars when I bought it to probably three hundred fifty thousand dollars at one point during the worst part of the cycle
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.640]   Condo mortgages were shut off the market was done. So you couldn't refinance you couldn't get a condo till mortgage people
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.920]   you know were preserving cash and
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.520]   Foreclosures were happening in the building left and right and therefore I got negatively affected and everybody who kept on paying their mortgage
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.760]   Got negatively affected. It's clear that the housing market is very strong right now
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.840]   I have written my thesis that I believe the housing market will continue to go up over the next three years
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.760]   It's not gonna go at the same pace as it has been I think the price
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.880]   Appreciation will decelerate to the high single digits over the next three years all the same
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.600]   Prices are still gonna go up. However, it's not a guarantee
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.520]   Even if there's an 80% chance the property market could continue to go up. There's still a 20% chance. It could get knocked down
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.600]   Even if you start with pocket aces and poker
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.720]   Pocket aces get cracked all the time
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.200]   So let's go through the unlucky scenario and the unlikely scenario that you buy home at the top of the market
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.100]   At the time of this podcast publication. So what happens first you go into denial
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.520]   You'll stand behind your decision to buy at the very beginning
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.480]   Even if you see a neighboring home on the market sit for longer or drop its asking price or just sell a little bit less
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.640]   You'll justify your purchase by saying your home has a better layout
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.040]   a nicer Feng Shui
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.080]   Better, you know curtains or fixtures or whatnot
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.280]   You'll tell yourself that you bought your home mainly for a better lifestyle first
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.700]   And then after about a year the elation of owning your home fades a little bit
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.520]   It's similar to the fading elation of buying a new car with a loan. You're thrilled for the first six months
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.480]   however
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.860]   That thrill fades because the car payments stay the same and so eventually there's gonna be this crossover point where your joy
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.300]   Fades and then that straight line payment stays the same and these start getting a little bit bummed out
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.140]   - you begin to accept your mistake
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.860]   Between 12 to 24 months post purchase you start realizing that maybe you didn't make the best purchase after all you start telling yourself
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.640]   Well in the long run things will be fine
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.440]   This is what stock traders always tell their themselves when they make a bad trade. Ah, I'm investing for the long run, right?
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.440]   It's how you make yourself feel better
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.840]   But the more you look at homes that sell for less the more you beat yourself up internally about your purchase
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.680]   You start doing calculations and how much you could have saved on the down payment or on the month of cash flow if you had
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.080]   Just waited a little bit longer or you had been a little bit pickier or you had negotiated a little bit harder
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.320]   You look at the nicer homes you could have bought with what you paid and you start kicking yourself a little bit
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.840]   Finally you tell yourself. Well, it's just money at the end of the day. You can always make more money
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.480]   And again, you are living in your home. You bought it for a better lifestyle
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.920]   the third thing you start thinking about is
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.920]   worst-case scenarios due to leverage a
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.400]   10% decline in the value of your home is a 50% decline in your 20% down payment and of course a 20% decline in the
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.720]   Value of your home is a hundred percent decline in your down payment
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.600]   Once the momentum to sell begins in real estate, it's very hard to change. It's kind of like a super tanker
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.640]   very wide and slow turns
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.440]   Momentum kind of continues to build until after about two or three years
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.200]   It kind of settles at the bottom for another one or two years and then generally based on history
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.960]   It goes back up during a worst-case scenario
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.920]   You start calculating how long you can keep the house before you run out of savings or if you lose your job
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.240]   You also calculate how low the house can go before it no longer makes sense to keep paying the mortgage
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.200]   Many people made that calculation in 2008 9 10 11 12 probably as well
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.120]   and they just let it go they gave the keys back to the bank and they said this is your problem and
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.480]   They just walked away from their equity hurt their credit score and so forth
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.880]   it's hard not to freak out at this stage, especially if you have children because
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.240]   You know the house could ruin you you could be so underwater. Your credit is crushed. You lose all your equity
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.200]   How are you gonna get into job again?
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.000]   It just depends on how bad the economy can get for those of you who are under I would say
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.320]   3540 it's hard to really experience how bad the economy was back in 2008 2009 2010
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.000]   If it gets like that, it's really bad. It's a systemic crisis, but I don't think it's gonna get that bad
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I don't think it's gonna get that bad because
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.120]   credit scores
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.040]   Credit reports the financial health of borrowers today is so much better than back then
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.000]   All right, but let's keep on focusing on the negatives, you know a bad downturn. What are you gonna do?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.520]   The fourth thing you're gonna do is you're gonna start to cut out all excess fat from your budget
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.680]   You know, you are a rational human being you are not a zombie you can adapt you can learn you can hustle
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.360]   There's no clear evidence that Americans can save more if they want to if we want to
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:04.640]   Then during the pandemic in April 2020 the US saving rate went from 6%
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.320]   Which is okay to 32%
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.840]   We can save more if we want to and today mid
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.520]   2021 the saving rate is still hovering around 10 12 percent
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:24.560]   That's pretty good. And of course, not only can we all slash our budgets we could all do some side hustles
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.460]   We could all make some extra money cutting grass driving cars
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:35.060]   Assembling furniture teaching tennis teaching ballet music violin, whatever it is
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.040]   We can all do something to make a little bit more money. So if you get through these stages
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.800]   Well, I think you'll be okay
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.560]   The downturn usually lasts two to five years and if you keep on paying your mortgage
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.920]   Nothing really bad happens
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:58.360]   It's just a psychological knock where you could have saved money or made more money had you waited. That's it and
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.840]   Given that nothing really happens or bad happens except for a mental knock
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:10.120]   It's so important to follow a good home buying rule. I've presented the 30 33 home buying rule
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   30% of cash flow
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.040]   30% cash
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.720]   By no more than 3x your household income, you know, it's a pretty conservative rule
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:26.120]   But if you follow this rule and a downturn happens, you're probably gonna be fine if you stop paying your mortgage
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.040]   Let's say the worst case
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.320]   Your credit score is gonna get knocked 30 days late
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:38.040]   You're gonna get a 40 to 110 point hit 90 days late on paying your mortgage 70 to 135 point hit
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.760]   If you do a foreclosure a short sale
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:49.280]   85 to 160 point hit and then bankruptcy is 130 to 240 point hit the higher your credit score
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.760]   Actually the more it's gonna get hit
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:59.800]   Therefore if you've got a great credit score and you can afford the payments, I would just keep on paying keep on enjoying your life
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.000]   Build that cash reserve work on building your income and cutting expenses
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.420]   Over time things are gonna self-correct as we are seeing right now
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.280]   I mean the people who held on to their homes during the last financial crisis
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.240]   I would say most of them are in the green now now, obviously the opportunity cost is another thing
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.760]   they could have invested in something else and maybe have made more or
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.720]   You know again if they didn't buy at the top of the market and just waited several years
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:33.200]   They could have made a lot more but let's be realistic. We just can't time it properly. I
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:40.280]   Personally never like to buy into a frenzy whether it's a housing market frenzy equity frenzy or anything
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.600]   That's why we were talking so much in 2020
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:52.040]   During the bottom in first quarter or second quarter 2020 why we should be strategically looking at buying real estate and buying equities
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.880]   And if you've been listening to this podcast for a while or reading financial samurai for a while
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:02.840]   That is when we were really going on in we're finding strategies on how to convince people to sell to us
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.280]   Because doom was here. You know, we talked about real estate love letters
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.440]   We're talking about analyzing earnings estimates and seeing what expectations are versus reality all these things
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.800]   They're great to talk about and we can never get it a hundred percent, right?
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   But I think if we do our due diligence learn from others
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.360]   Pay attention to what's going on learn from past cycles. I think we can build ourselves an edge
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.640]   So the edge right now is a little bit difficult because everybody is buying everything
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:42.120]   There's just massive amounts of liquidity everywhere and interest rates are probably gonna stay low for a long long time
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.600]   I'm gonna make the call that interest rates are gonna stay low for the rest of our lives because we've got this inflation
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.880]   interest rate cycle down pat
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.460]   Technology and productivity are our friends when it comes to managing inflation
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:01.240]   So our emerging markets exporting their deflation to us right now. It's China. Maybe it's India next
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.400]   Maybe it's a country in Africa
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:10.320]   the world is getting smaller and it's going to continue to get smaller with better technology better connectivity and
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.200]   Therefore interest rates are gonna stay lower because inflation is gonna be contained
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:22.960]   finally, I just want to say that you don't have to go all in on real estate now and all in means buying a physical property
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.520]   With debt you don't have to leverage up to buy property. You can buy a real estate ETF
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.940]   You can buy stocks like Home Depot a public REIT or a private eREIT from Fundrise
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:41.580]   There are many opportunities to invest in real estate without having to go all in you can invest in real estate more surgically if you
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.480]   Are worried personally, I'm not that worried about a housing market correction
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.240]   Because of all the fundamentals that are in place today
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:55.120]   I believe there's gonna be a huge rush back to big city living as people realize that the
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.040]   Opportunities the jobs the connections are all much better
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.700]   When you're closer to the people in power who have the money
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.100]   I was just out and about last
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:11.160]   Couple nights ago after a softball league game and I went out on a popular Street called Chestnut Street in the marina
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.680]   Which is the northern side of San Francisco and it was popping
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.540]   Every single restaurant was packed. All the stalls outdoors were packed
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:27.560]   It is absolutely clear to me that big city living is back at the same time
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.680]   There is going to be a long-term
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:37.600]   demographic shift towards lower cost areas of the country because of technology because we can and because we all are more
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.520]   Accepting of working from home in conclusion. I don't think we're at the top of the market
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.280]   Maybe a 20% chance over the next one or two years that we buy at the top of the market
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.340]   But that means there's an 80% chance the housing market continues to do well
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:57.360]   I'd love to hear from all of you on whether you've bought at the top of the market in the past or whether you think
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.480]   The market is toppy right now, and if you like this podcast, I'd appreciate a positive review
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.480]   Thanks folks, and I'll see you guys around
