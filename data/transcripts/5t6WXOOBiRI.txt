[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   I don't know if you've ever heard anyone that tried this, but there's this program called ClearScout.
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.560]   Yep, I think it's mostly for finding things that are lost at security.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.740]   Once it's in the general airport lost and found, ClearScout can help you.
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.140]   If you leave something at a TSA checkpoint, they're very good at getting it back.
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.140]   It implied that it would also work if I left something at the gate.
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.100]   And they could go find it, but I've never used it. Sounds like you've used it?
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.740]   We've used it for clients before, and I'll say that once you get to the general airport lost and found,
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.220]   God be with you. It's impossible getting things back.
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.600]   Even like things you might leave on an airplane that then get turned into the general airport lost and found.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.240]   I mean, it happens. We've gotten jackets and iPads and laptops, but for some reason,
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.120]   it's like they kind of disappear once they hit airport lost and found.
