[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.060]   Two of your major themes, Pastor John, are God's sovereignty, of course, and the centrality
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.520]   of joy in God.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.760]   We're Christian hedonists.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.280]   How do these two topics relate?
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.400]   How does God's sovereignty and the centrality of joy in God relate?
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.080]   How does Calvinism connect to joy in God?
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.440]   I love that question, Tony.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.440]   I really do.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.640]   I mean, these are two of the most precious and glorious things in my life.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.960]   I could talk about these all day long, which created a problem when I went to answer this
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.440]   with you.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.920]   I think I'm going to need to break this into two, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.840]   So you decide whether you want to make this two or not, but there's two ways to answer
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840]   this.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.280]   One is foundational, about the very nature of God himself and how his godness, his free
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.320]   and independent sovereignty relates to our joy.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.720]   That's the first one that I'll answer.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.400]   And the second one that may need a second APJ is how God's sovereignty in this fallen world
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.000]   actually helps us fight for our joy in the face of enormous suffering and sorrow.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.040]   So let me tackle the first one, and then we'll see how long it takes, and we can go for a
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.400]   second if you want to.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.400]   Here's how they relate.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.900]   God's sovereignty is owing to his completeness as God.
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.880]   He has no needs.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.160]   He depends on no one and nothing.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:41.960]   All that he needs, he has in and of himself, and therefore he is infinitely happy in the
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.980]   fellowship of the Trinity.
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.720]   So the love that the Father has for the Son, and the Son has for the Father, this love
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.360]   is essentially joy, because they're not lovingly enduring each other.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.500]   Like there's no long suffering in the Trinity like there is for sinners outside the Trinity.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.720]   They have an infinite pleasure in each other's perfections, and therefore joy, and this is
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:20.560]   what just blows my mind, and I love it, therefore joy is at the essence of God's Godness.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.020]   It is the foundation of his sovereignty.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.880]   The reason God is free and independent and powerful outside God is that he is completely
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.320]   happy inside God.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.560]   He has no needs, and he's sovereignly independent because he's happy at the core of his being
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:50.000]   in his all-sufficiency, his self-sufficiency, and therefore when he creates the world, it's
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.200]   not owing to any deficiency in him.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.520]   He didn't create out of need.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.120]   He didn't create because he hoped that his creation would supply something that he was
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.260]   lacking.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.500]   It was motivated by giving, not needing, and therefore, and this is the greatest news in
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.520]   all the world, is that therefore he spills over with his own joy in God.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.360]   God's creating the world is God's intention to share with creatures in his own image the
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.360]   very joy that he has in himself.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.180]   That's what he wanted to share.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.560]   So when you read in John 17, the prayer of Jesus, what he desires for us at the end of
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:44.000]   that prayer is that we would be with him where he is to see his glory that God had given
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.680]   him and that we would love him with the very love that the Father has for the Son, which
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.840]   is I think what the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is really all about.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.680]   The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Father loving the Son, and the Son loving the Father.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.960]   And oh for the day, Tony, oh for the day when we'll be done with sinning and the joy that
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.000]   we have in God will be the kind of joy that he really designed for us to have.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.480]   And therefore, our joy is not marginal to the reason for the universe.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.380]   This is what's so mind-boggling when people say, "Oh, I think joy is just icing on the
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.520]   cake of Christianity, and really it's all about commitment and obedience, and if joy
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.760]   comes, that's nice, and if it doesn't, that's okay."
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.200]   It's crazy!
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.400]   It's right at the heart of what the universe, who God is and who we are.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:46.200]   So we were created to share in God's joy, in God, and he made us to do this.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.360]   And here's the last piece of this big answer.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.360]   He made us to do this in such a way that when we are most satisfied in him, he is most glorified
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.360]   in us.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.480]   You see why I'm a Christian hedonist, why I've spent all my adult life trying to think
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.800]   through the meaning of joy in a world like this.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.720]   When we are thrilled, when we are most satisfied in all the perfections of God, we show those
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.160]   perfections to be precious to us, to be our treasure.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.820]   We highlight them and lift them up and magnify them, and that's why the universe was made.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.860]   So if you ask me, "Tony, what's the relationship in the big picture between the sovereignty
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.840]   of God and joy?"
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:45.460]   I would say, "In God, joy is the ground of his sovereignty and the overflow of his sovereignty."
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.320]   Because he is perfectly happy, he is independent and free and needs nothing and sovereignly
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.600]   works on behalf of others, and when he does that, what he's working for is our joy in
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   him.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.680]   And so there's this great circle of enjoying God and glorifying God.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.680]   Yes.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.360]   And speaking of sovereignty and Calvinism, Pastor John has a new book coming out on November
