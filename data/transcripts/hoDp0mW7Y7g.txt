[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   I would like to call attention once more to the words that are to be found in the Gospel
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.920]   according to Saint John in the fourth chapter, reading verses 10, 13 and 40.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.120]   Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knowest the gift of God, and who it is that
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.840]   saith unto thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.360]   thee living water. Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.160]   shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.640]   thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.560]   up into everlasting life. We are considering this great and glorious statement of the Christian
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.280]   Gospel as it was made by our Lord and Savior himself to the woman of Samaria. You are familiar
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.560]   with the context and the surroundings. This is essential Christianity and there is nothing
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.460]   more important than that we should be certain that we not only know that, but that we have
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.800]   experienced something of it. I have been trying to say that in my understanding of these matters
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.040]   the greatest sin of Christian people at the present time, and it applies to evangelical
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.760]   people as much as others, is the sin of reducing this glorious Gospel to the level and the
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:45.640]   measure of our own understanding, and still more, of our own experience. The contrast
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.680]   between what is offered here and what so currently and frequently passes as the Christian life
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.360]   and the Christian experience is amazing. We see this contrast not only as we compare ourselves
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.960]   with what we find here, but with what we can also find in the literature of the history
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.120]   of the Church and of God's people. There is nothing more fatal than just to contrast
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.720]   ourselves with those who are outside. We must never be comparing ourselves and judging ourselves
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.200]   by the standard of the Scripture itself and by the most notable examples of Christian
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.720]   life and living as to be found so abundantly in the Christian literature. Well now, here
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.200]   it is, and this is the thing by which we must examine ourselves. We do so, I say, not only
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.920]   that we may enjoy this glorious life which the Son of God came into the world to give,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.520]   but still more at a time like this, that we may be enabled to function truly as Christian
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.960]   people. Whenever you get people manifesting this kind and order of life, they immediately
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.560]   become a great evangelistic force and power. Their very lives do it. There is nothing that
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.760]   speaks so eloquently as a life. There is no comparison between this kind of New Testament
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.280]   evangelism, which is through the members of the Church, and an artificial or organized
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.320]   evangelism. The contrast again is a very striking one. But this is God's appointed method.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.840]   It is through his people that he has generally convicted others and aroused in them a desire
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.680]   to share the kind of life that they see lived and exemplified in the lives of people with
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.720]   whom they come in contact. Well now, here then, I say, is the most urgent thing for
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.960]   us all. This is Christianity. Our Lord says here quite plainly and specifically that he
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:00.680]   has living water to give us. And that what it leads to is this, that the one who receives
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:09.080]   it, who drinks it, shall never thirst. Because this water that he gives will become in such
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:17.360]   a person a well of water springing up into everlasting life. It shall be in him a well
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.040]   of water springing up into everlasting life. Well now, why is it that we know so little
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.920]   about this? Well, there are many hindrances, and we have considered a large number of them.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.200]   We are now looking at this matter positively. Here our Lord puts it very positively to this
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.160]   woman, and I have suggested it comes to this. We have got to realize our need first. We
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.320]   have got to be aware of the quality of the life we have and how it measures up to this
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.160]   test and this standard. You can look at a liquid in a glass and it looks like milk,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.280]   but if your analyst comes to analyze it, he may find it very deficient in fats and may
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.360]   have a good deal of adulteration with water. It looks like milk. And that's true of so
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.560]   much of Christianity. It looks as if it's the right thing, but when you analyze it,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.040]   you find that it is seriously defective. It's got the general appearance, the color, it's
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.120]   liquid and so on, but there's very little more than that to it. Now, therefore, we must
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.440]   really be aware of our need. We must see that nothing else in the world can satisfy our
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:32.400]   need but this. And then we must go on to realize that this is indeed living water. And what
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.080]   we are now doing is to consider the characteristics of this great life which our Lord has come
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.880]   to give us. He keeps on saying this, "I am come that they might have life and that
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.320]   they might have it more abundantly." That's Christianity. Well, what are the characteristics
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.920]   of this? I've suggested they can be divided into general and particular. We considered
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.840]   the general last time. It's experimental, not something theoretical, but something that
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.640]   you know and experience. It's something that is always intimately connected with the Lord
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.840]   Jesus Christ himself. It comes directly from him and thereby we differentiate it from all
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.280]   mystical experiences as such and all the various cults at the present time. Then we've started
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.880]   on the particular characteristics of this life. And the first is, of course, that it's
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.960]   something inside us. That well, the well he was pointing to, "Whosoever drinketh of
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.720]   this water shall thirst again." That's outside you. That's why you have to keep
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.680]   on going to it. He's using this well there out of which the woman of Samaria and others
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.160]   were drawing water. He uses this as a kind of parable. He says that's outside you,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.440]   so you have to keep on going backwards and forwards. Get a supply, you use it, you have
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.240]   to go back, and so it is. But this, he says, it's inside you, it's within. Now we've
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.560]   considered it. The next point I want to note is this one. It is a power. It's a power
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:09.280]   within us. A power which acts within us. "Shall become within you a well of water,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.040]   springing up." Now, if you know anything about a well, you know that that is its characteristic.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.000]   It's living. What a difference there is between a well and a trough with water in
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.520]   it, or a cistern with water in it. There's no life there. But here, there is an activity
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.960]   springing up. There's a power, there's a dynamic, there's a force. And this is the
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.280]   very thing that our Lord tells us is one of the outstanding characteristics of this life
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.640]   which he has to give us. Now, how do we know then whether we have this life or not? Well,
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:52.040]   let's test ourselves by this second particular characteristic. This manifestation of power
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:59.640]   within us. That, therefore, means something like this. That the Christian life is not
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:07.760]   primarily a life of our activity. Of course, we have things to do, but that's not the
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.800]   primary thing. That's not the essential thing. We're all along bearing in our minds,
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:20.520]   I trust, the contrast between religion, any kind of religion, and true Christianity. And
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:29.480]   this is again one of the chief characteristics. In religion, it is our activity that counts
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   the whole time. Think of it in Mohammedanism, "I've given the house, so they drop down
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.440]   and say their prayers." Think of it as you get it in Roman Catholicism, the mechanical
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:46.440]   aspect of it. But it's equally true of much of Protestantism. Our activity, but here we
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:53.280]   are in a different realm altogether. The chief thing here, the first thing here, is a power
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:01.920]   that is acting within us. Well or not, a springing up. It's inside you. And there it is. Whatever
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.520]   you may be doing or not doing, it has life in it and vigor and power, and it acts in
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:16.480]   us. And so, the relationship between the Christian and his activities is this. And this is where
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:26.480]   it's such a striking contrast with religion. The Christian acts because he is made to act.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:33.480]   His action, his activity, is the result of this other activity that is anterior to and
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:39.840]   comes before all his activity. In other words, we are dealing, if you like, with what may
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:47.280]   be called here the dynamic of the Holy Spirit. Now, our Lord puts it that he has this to
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.800]   give. And it's right, of course, he does. And he gives us life, he gives us the Spirit.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.240]   Did you notice a phrase in the hymn we've just been singing? "O Jesus, light of all
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:06.080]   below, thou fount of life and fire." You may criticise that, how can you have fire
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:12.040]   in a fountain? Doesn't matter. He's the fount, he's the source of life and fire.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:18.560]   Now I want to emphasise this fire in particular. Life, yes, but fire at the moment. Power,
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:25.840]   there's power in a fire. And this is within us, fountain within us, the dynamic of the
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:33.760]   Holy Spirit. The Apostle Paul puts this in his own particular way in the second chapter
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.680]   of his epistle to the Philippians in these well-known words, in verses 12 and 13. "Wherefore,
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.880]   my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:52.800]   in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:01.640]   worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure." Now that's a very perfect
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:07.680]   statement of this very point. We work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:14.400]   But why do we do so? And the answer is, it is God that worketh in you both to will and
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   to do. And we work out our salvation because he has first of all been working in us, both
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.160]   the willing, the desire, and everything else. Now this is an essential characteristic of
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:36.160]   this Christian life. And again I am constrained to put it like this, that while it's very
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:42.480]   difficult to put these things in words, in the realm of experience there is no difficulty
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:51.480]   at all. In other words, it is the difference between life and a machine. The machine you
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.600]   have to wind up. And you wind it up and it will go for a certain length of time, then
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:03.640]   it stops, then you have to wind it up again. But that's a machine. Now this is life,
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:10.160]   and it's life within, and it's a power that is operating within. In other words,
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.920]   the impulse comes not from ourselves. You remember last Sunday morning I was pointing
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.520]   out that religion which is external, you have to remind yourself of it. Ah, Sunday morning
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:28.040]   again, so you know, different from other days, so you do this and that. Or an illness, or
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.600]   an accident, or a death, or a funeral, something pulls you, and you have to be reminded. It
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:40.240]   isn't like that here. There is an impulse within. There is a call that comes within.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:48.200]   There is an urging. There is a longing created. And you do nothing about it at this stage
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:55.880]   at all. It just happens to you. You find yourself the subject of an activity which is not your
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:03.280]   own. You're aware of a working within you. Somebody in a different connection and not
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:11.440]   really saying what I'm trying to say now said, "Power within us working for righteousness."
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:18.920]   It is something like that. Or I've often quoted or applied to this the words of Wordsworth.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.360]   He meant something quite different, but we can appropriate his words. "I have felt
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:29.600]   a presence that disturbs me with the joys of elevated thought." Now this is it, a
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.240]   disturbing. When you are perhaps desiring to go in a given direction, you're aware
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:42.040]   of an activity within you, some impulse, some call, some urging, some longing that you're
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.760]   aware of within yourself. You haven't done this. You may have been reading something
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:51.240]   secular. Your thoughts may have been otherwise engaged, but suddenly you are aware that there's
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:59.400]   something, someone within you, moving you, leading you in this direction. It is God that
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:08.520]   worketh in you. There it is. That is a very vital part of this whole Christian position.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.240]   And if we are not aware of the working of God in us, well then I fail to see how we
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:19.320]   have any right to call ourselves Christians at all. That's religion. You can be religious
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.800]   in Christian terminology. You can be religious inside the Christian church. But this is one
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:34.080]   of these vital things. Our activities, I say, must always be the result of His activity.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:39.760]   It is the well of water, it is the life within that stimulates, that God that worketh in
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.600]   you both to will and to do. Before you've ever done anything, why did you desire it?
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.320]   Why did you will it? That's the question. And the characteristic of the Christian life
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:58.320]   is that our activities are always the result of this prior movement. We move because we
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:07.840]   are moved. We act because of the stimulus that has come apart from ourselves. Now, this
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:14.320]   I believe is a most important point for us at the present time. We are living in an age
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:21.560]   of activism and of activities. We are living in an age when people are so confused that
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:27.080]   they become children and like to have everything set out before them by rule and regulation
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:34.480]   and by numbers. This is a very real snare. It's a snare that saints have fallen into,
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:40.680]   that you just live according to a system. You live by rote. You live by obeying to commands
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:46.200]   and numbers. Now the Christian has got to act, work out your own salvation with fear
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:53.480]   and trembling. Yes, but it's never something that is imposed upon him from the outside.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:16:05.120]   It is something that works out from inside. You see the danger. There are forms of Christianity,
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.240]   let's grant them that they are Christian. But the Catholic type of piety is always in
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:19.160]   grave danger at this point. The life is determined by the priest or by certain books and writings,
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:26.840]   and these are imposed upon people. And that happens to many, even in Protestant circles.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.120]   They take a decision in a meeting or something like that, and then they're given a list
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.720]   of rules and regulations. Now they've got to do this, that, and the other. And they
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:39.160]   do it because they're told to do it. It has become the thing to do. You exchange one
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:46.280]   pattern of behavior for another. Now there's a danger of being misunderstood at this point.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.360]   I'm well aware of it, but nevertheless this is one of the most essential points of all.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:57.640]   I have known so many Christians, young Christians in particular, who at a given stage in their
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:04.520]   lives appear to be true Christians, but who later revealed that they'd never been Christians
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.280]   at all. What was happening to them? Well, what was happening to them was this. I have
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.560]   known many students who in their student days, when they were members of Christian unions
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.480]   and carried along by the momentum and the excitement and the movement and the activity
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.600]   of that, appeared to be wonderful Christians. They leave the university and come back into
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:31.680]   the world and go out into life. And once they've lost all this that was round and about them,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.400]   they have nothing. They fall away completely. They may even scoff at the Christian faith
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:42.720]   and ridicule it. I've known many instances of this. There is what is known as the leakage
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.160]   which takes place in that kind of evangelistic work, particularly among students. This is
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.400]   just a fact, a solid fact, and I'm giving you the explanation of it. You can have a
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.840]   system imposed upon you. You can conform to a society to which you belong, and you're
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:04.800]   carried along by something entirely outside yourself. It isn't God working in you both
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   to will and to do. You see, when a man has got this fountain inside him, it doesn't
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.080]   matter whether he's in a Christian society or whether he's not. The fountain is in
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:22.120]   him. He works out his own salvation with fear and trembling because it is God that worketh
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:29.000]   in him both to will and to do. Now, this you see is taught everywhere throughout the New
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.960]   Testament. We read about the fruit of the Spirit, and about bearing fruit. It's our
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.360]   Lord himself who uses this comparison, and this is it. You see, we are dealing with life
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:45.320]   here, not with mechanics. And if it's a question of fruit bearing, well, it's bound
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:51.160]   to come from inside outwards. You don't add fruit to a tree. No, no. It is the life
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.760]   that produces the fruit, and it takes time to do so. And you get different stages. You
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.680]   get the bud, and the development of the bud, and then the growth and the full maturity,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:07.880]   and so on. Now, that's God's way. That's life. Not the imposing of things from the
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:13.880]   outside. Not doing things because you're told to, but a desire created within. Work
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you. In you,
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:29.000]   remember, both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Well, there is one manifestation
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   of this power, or there is one way whereby we can test whether this power is in us or
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.800]   not. But let's have a look at another. It's very similar, of course, and yet there is
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:46.000]   a real distinction here. You can put it like this, if you like. Because this is the nature
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:57.800]   of the Christian life, within it follows a necessity that it is not a life which we control,
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:06.960]   but rather we are people who are being controlled by it. Here again is the most important distinction.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   The religious man is always in control of himself and his religion, always. That is
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:22.920]   the characteristic of religion. You take it up, you do it, you're in control of it.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:29.000]   But here we are in an entirely different realm. Because this is inside us, because it's
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:38.960]   life, because it's a power springing up, it is in control of us. How can I put this
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:46.000]   to you? This is indeed the most wonderful thing about being a Christian. This is the
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.120]   thing that guarantees the final perseverance of the saints. We are not in control. I live,
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:21:04.280]   yet not I. That's it. The life I know, I live in the flesh, I live by. It sounds contradictory,
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.760]   and yet again, experimentally, there is no difficulty about this at all. And every one
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.800]   of us at this moment knows this. Are you in control, or are you being controlled? Are
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:21.880]   you in control of your life? Or can you say, with that centurion who came to our Lord,
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:30.320]   I'm a man under authority. The Christian is always a man under authority. There is
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.600]   always this power, this life, working within him, springing up.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.400]   Now I want to make this point so clear that I'm going to put it like this. And I have
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:47.120]   found this a most valuable test, and incidentally, one of the excellent grounds of assurance
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:54.360]   of salvation. It works like this. This is here within you, it's a well. It's become,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.600]   you've drunk the water, and it becomes within you a well of water, springing up this energy,
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:10.360]   this power, this bubbling quality, this dynamic. Yes, and sometimes that makes you very unhappy.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:17.760]   What I mean by that is this, that in a backsliding condition, you may want to do other things.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:24.960]   You may want to revert to the life of the world. You may want to go with your old friends,
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.120]   and find all this interesting and attractive once more. And that is what you'd like to
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:35.840]   do. But this other thing is there inside you, and working in you, and you're annoyed. You
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.680]   wish you'd never known anything about it. It's a kind of nuisance to you. It's something
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:46.160]   that's spoiling life for you. And you resent it. And you fight against it. You struggle
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:53.360]   against it. You do your utmost to silence it, explain it away. You're glad to read in
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.760]   the newspaper that some critic has said this or that, or some church dignitary seems to
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.120]   have denied the whole of Christianity and allows you liberty and freedom. "Ah, you
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.000]   see, this is it. I've been too narrow." You're familiar with this. But the more you do that,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.200]   the more this other power within you is working, and there it is, and you can't silence it.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.320]   You can't stop it. It goes on, and it nags at you, and it troubles you, and it speaks,
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:24.600]   and you're in a conflict. Now this is an absolute proof that there is this life of
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:31.480]   God within you, that there is a power working within you. Now let me give you my authority
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:36.480]   for saying this kind of thing. Listen to the Apostle Paul putting it in the fifth chapter
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:44.120]   of the epistle to the Galatians. This I say then, verse 16, "Walk in the Spirit, and
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:50.520]   ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit,
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:57.640]   and the Spirit lusteth against the flesh. And these are contrary the one to the other,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:02.840]   so that ye cannot do the things that ye would." Now you may say to me, "But surely there's
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.000]   many an unconverted man who knows this kind of conflict." No, not this kind of conflict.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.160]   Many a moral man knows the trouble he gets with his conscience, and how he's made unhappy
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:21.600]   after he's fallen into sin and experiences remorse. But that's on a very different plane
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.760]   and a very different level from this. The word used here is the word "lusteth." The
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:32.200]   flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit lusteth against the flesh. This is
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:38.400]   a tremendous power. It isn't merely that you're aware of the conscience speaking to
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:46.280]   you. There is an intensity about it all. You're aware of a vigor and of a power. And there
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:53.400]   is this conflict which is within you. Now, the apostle James puts that in a sense even
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   in a stronger manner in the fourth chapter of his epistle and in the fifth verse, where
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:05.160]   we read, "Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain, 'The Spirit that dwelleth
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:11.600]   in us lusteth to envy.'" Now, this is the authorized translation, but it's generally
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:19.680]   agreed that the true idea there is this, that the Spirit that has been put within us as
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.800]   Christians, this water which we've drunk and which has become a well of water within
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:32.080]   us, the Spirit that has been given us and that dwells in us is anxious about us and
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:40.760]   lusteth, as it were, for our entire sanctification in a most jealous manner. What a wonderful
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:47.760]   thought that is, that God has put his Spirit in us, and the Spirit now is anxious for our
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:53.120]   perfection, and he's jealous over us. He knows the devil, the world, the flesh, and
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.080]   the devil are fighting, that the flesh itself is on the side of the world and the devil,
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.040]   and therefore there is this lusting of the flesh. Yes, but the Spirit, Paul says the
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:11.680]   Spirit also lusteth against the flesh. James goes even further, "He lusteth for us and
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:17.640]   for our deliverance and sanctification with a jealous envy." You know the idea, the
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:23.320]   picture is in a sense of a parent looking on at a child and concerned and anxious that
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:30.080]   the child should do well. This kind of anxiety, lusting, it's as strong and as powerful
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:36.400]   as that. Now this is this power of the well of water that is within us, springing up into
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.920]   everlasting life. It is God working in us, both to will and to do, and you see this is
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:47.880]   the very expression used, "with a jealous envy." So great is the concern of the Spirit.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:54.600]   Now the Christian, I say, is a man who's aware of this, that he's not really in control
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:01.400]   of himself, he is being controlled by this other. He can fight against it, he can quench
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:08.160]   the Spirit, he can grieve of the Spirit, but the Spirit is always there. And so we can
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:17.200]   go on and look at this as it's put by John in his first epistle. And in the third chapter,
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.320]   verses eight and nine, now these are verses that are often misunderstood. "He that
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:28.720]   committeth sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:34.200]   the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil." Now then,
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:41.880]   "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin," why not? "For his seed remaineth
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:49.160]   in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God." Now this is a very perfect statement
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:57.440]   of this point. "He that committeth sin," why does he do so? He's the natural man,
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:05.560]   he goes on, he lives a life of sin. Why does he do so? He is of the devil. What you do
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:11.280]   is the result of what you are. You commit sin because you are of the devil, that's
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.680]   the nature that is in you. Our Lord put this quite explicitly to the Pharisees and Scribes
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.240]   when he said, "You are of your father, the devil, and the works of your father he
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:27.280]   will do." The nature must express itself, it must come out. You see, it's true on
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:34.200]   both sides. A life of sin is not something that's added on to a man, it is the expression
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:43.120]   of a man. As a man thinks, so he is. You know, actions come from the inside. Again, let me
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:50.400]   quote the words of our Lord to you. You see, this is always where people misunderstand.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:57.560]   When do sins come from? Well, our Lord says, "Evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, and
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.680]   all these things, they come out of the heart." It's not that which enters into a man.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.200]   See, that's the trouble with the Pharisee always. He's concerned about the outside
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:11.600]   and that which goes in, that which he takes in. It isn't. No, no. It's out of the heart
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:18.160]   that come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, etc. It's the wrong, it's
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.560]   the polluted fountain. It isn't this fountain, it's another one. He that committeth sin
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.520]   is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from the beginning. Now the Son of Man, he says,
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:35.280]   was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. So then this becomes true.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:41.040]   Whosoever is born of God, now this is the place you start with. You don't look at a
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:47.200]   man's actions. You say, "What's the life that's in him? Is he born of God?" Whosoever
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:53.080]   is born of God does not commit sin. Now of course, that obviously doesn't mean that
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.960]   he never commits a single act of sin. It means he doesn't go on sinning. And the tense
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:03.920]   of the verb used is in this continuous. He doesn't go on. It's the contrast with the
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:10.440]   unbeliever. The unbeliever lives a life of sin. The believer does not live a life of
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:15.320]   sin. He may occasionally fall into it, but he doesn't live and go on living a life
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:24.720]   of sin. Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin. Why not? Because his seed remaineth
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:32.600]   in him. There is a seed of new life in this man. Now John refers to work with this idea
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:37.720]   of a seed of life. It's the same thing exactly, just a different comparison, as the well of
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.920]   water springing up into everlasting life. But John says, "Whosoever is born of God
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:49.000]   does not go on committing sin, because this seed remaineth in him." And then he cannot
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:59.800]   sin. He cannot go on living a life of sin. Why? Well, because he is born of God. I said
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:07.840]   that this is one of the greatest and profoundest sources of assurance and of comfort and of
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.240]   consolation. You see what he means is this. Here is a man, he is born of God, very well,
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:18.160]   but he's in this sinful world. And there is the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:24.800]   And he gets attacked and he may fall into sin, but he cannot fall away. His seed remaineth
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:31.200]   in him. He will not be allowed to. He may for a while, but he cannot go back to that
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:38.320]   life which is of the devil. Later on John puts this still more explicitly. He says,
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.240]   "All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin unto death." We know that whosoever
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:48.520]   is born of God sinneth not. Chapter 5, verse 18. "But he that is begotten of God keepeth
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:54.320]   himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not." And we know that we are of God and
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:00.000]   the whole world lieth in wickedness. That's it. Now, the man who's got this life in
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.640]   him doesn't lie in wickedness. He never can. This remains in him, this seed, this
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:11.160]   life of God, that evil one, cannot touch us in the sense of ever getting us back into
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.920]   his embrace and under his control again. No, no. The Christian is a man who's under
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:25.160]   the control of the Spirit of the living God. So I put it like that, that he's no longer
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:33.640]   in control of himself, but he is being controlled. The Christian is not a man who has to force
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:39.800]   himself to live the Christian life. He is being forced to live the Christian life by
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:45.960]   the power that is within him. And all you and I can do is this. We can either yield
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:52.520]   to that power or else we can resist it. We can quench it. We can disobey. And if we do,
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:59.640]   you will be miserable. When the Christian goes back to sin, he's a miserable wretch.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.600]   And he'll continue like that. He will not be allowed to enjoy it. There is this power
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:10.120]   that is within him. He doesn't make himself live the Christian life. He's made to live
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:15.600]   the Christian life. This is a very wonderful thing. It's a very wonderful thing in pastoral
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:23.200]   experience to see a backslider restored, seeing a man having to come back. He can't help
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:29.160]   himself. He's got to come back. The backslider must come back. He'll get tired of the hell
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:35.400]   in which he's living. He will not be allowed to. Now this is something that is implicit
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:41.600]   in this idea of the well of water springing up, the power that is working within us. And
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:46.640]   so this is the way in which you see the New Testament preaches this doctrine of sanctification.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.940]   It isn't always appealing to us to do this or that or attacking us individually and on
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.840]   particular points. You know, if you want that sort of thing, you've got a religious outlook
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.480]   and not a Christian outlook. All I'm here to do is to tell you that if you've got the
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:04.800]   life of God in you, if you sin, you're a fool. You're asking for misery and you'll get it.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.920]   And you'll go on living in hell as it were until you obey this power that is working
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.720]   in you. It'll bring you back. It may knock you down. It'll take your health from you.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.240]   It'll make you lose your money. If you are a child of God, well then I say don't be a
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:26.920]   fool. Don't resist the Spirit. You'll only bring trouble upon yourself. Oh love that wilt
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:37.000]   not let me go. I rest my weary soul in thee. I give thee back the life I own, that in thy
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.120]   notion depths its flow. May richer, fuller be. That's it. He'll follow you all your way.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:49.400]   The hound of heaven. Think of any illustration you like. This is it. Now it all comes under
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:56.280]   this general principle that we are not in control of this life. It is in control of
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:03.680]   us. So I make this next point which is this, a simple one and an obvious one. The kind
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.840]   of life which is lived by the Christian is of necessity, therefore never mechanical and
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:15.680]   it's never legalistic. These are the terms that are used in the New Testament are so
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:22.360]   wonderful. The word living, the word lively. I would have, if thou wouldest have asked
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.680]   of me said our Lord to this woman of Samaria, if thou knewest the gift of God and who it
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:33.360]   is that speaketh it, thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:39.520]   water. Now listen to Peter writing to people who are passing through a very difficult time.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.000]   He says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who according to his
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.360]   abundant mercy hath begotten us again into a lively hope, a living hope, a bubbling hope,
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:36:01.080]   a springing hope, a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." And goes
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:06.200]   on to say, "To an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:13.800]   in him for you who are kept by the power of God through faith and through salvation ready
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.600]   to be revealed at the last time." Now you read those epistles of Peter and you'll
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:25.360]   find that he's very fond of this living, lively, bubbling, sparkling quality and it's
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:30.880]   right. And that is again one of the best ways of testing whether we are just religious or
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:42.440]   whether we are Christian. Religion is always mechanical. Religion is always legalistic.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:49.960]   God knows exactly what to define, knows how far he can go, knows where to stop, and just
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:57.880]   lives in that sort of square, mechanical sort of life, watching his steps, just within the
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:05.640]   law. So nice, so moral, so clean, so good. Ah, what a contrast with Christianity. This
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:14.120]   is life. This is not mechanics, this is not law, this is not legalism. This man, he lives
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:19.400]   above the law. He fulfills the law because he's living in a realm above it. He's not
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:24.640]   just watching, taking off for he's done this and hasn't done that. The Pharisees knew exactly
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.320]   what they were doing in the Lord's parable of the Pharisee and the publican going up
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.680]   to the temple to pray, puts it so perfectly the Pharisee can get up and always recite
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.880]   exactly what he does. Fasts twice in the week, gives a tenth of his goods to the poor. He
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.720]   could have told him exactly when he prayed, how long he prayed, for he knows it, he's
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:49.280]   got it all exactly. Ah, what a tragedy, what a small life it is. There's no liberty, there's
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:55.560]   no abandon, there's no life, there is not living. Religions are always dead, and that's
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.680]   why they're always hopeless, and that's why they never help people when they need them
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:07.400]   most of all. Religion always lets you down at the point of your greatest need. You can't
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:12.480]   help others either if you've only just got religion. It's all under your control and
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:18.560]   power, you see. Whereas this other is never legalistic, mechanical, or small. It's big,
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:24.880]   it's living, it's lively. There's a freedom about it. But let me say one other thing this
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:31.160]   morning, and it follows directly from what I've been saying, and it is a most marvellous
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.840]   thing. I'm emphasising that this is a power that is acting in us. It is within us, but
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:43.640]   it's a power within us. And I want to end on this note of the greatness of the power.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:51.520]   The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:39:00.480]   life. Now this power is a variable quantity. This is a power that varies from person to
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:10.000]   person. Another most important point, Christians are never identical. If you show me a church
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.840]   of people in which they're all the same, I say it's not a church, it's a religious
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:22.320]   gathering. Any teaching or system that makes everybody the same, do the same things in
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:29.280]   the same way, and everything alike, that's never Christianity. Because it's never God.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:35.160]   How often have I said this, no two flowers are identical. They appear to be, but you
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:42.160]   examine them, you'll find they're not. And no two Christians are identical. Wide variation,
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:49.000]   variety, in the amount of the power. The Apostle Paul has put this perfectly, of course, in
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   his great illustration in 1 Corinthians 12, in the body, there are comely parts, less
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.880]   comely parts, they're all essential, they're all in the body, they're all of their function.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.720]   And ultimately in the sight of God they're all one. But there's great variation. Now
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.720]   the foolish people at Corinth hadn't grasped this principle, and so they were quarrelling
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.280]   over the gifts. But that's not what we're interested in. No, what we're interested
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   in is just to establish that there are variations in the degrees of this power that are experienced
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   by Christian people. But I want to say another thing. There are variations in the power in
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:36.240]   the same person, from time to time. Aren't you aware of that? Do you know what you're
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.440]   going to be like when you wake up tomorrow morning? If you do, you're not a Christian.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:47.280]   You see, we don't control this, as I've been emphasizing. We don't control it. What
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:53.640]   we do does affect it, but we don't control it. What we do affects it in this way. As
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:41:00.040]   I've been saying, if I disobey, if I rebel against the power that is in me, if I quench
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:06.720]   the spirit, or if I grieve the spirit, well, it makes a difference. It doesn't make an
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.440]   ultimate difference, it makes a temporary difference. But the point I'm establishing
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:19.400]   is this, that even granting all that, you and I are not at the central control. And
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:26.720]   we never know what it's going to be. I say it again to the glory of God. This pulpit
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:32.600]   is the most romantic place in the universe as far as I'm concerned. And for this reason,
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:38.720]   that I never know what's going to happen when I get here. Never. My anticipations are
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:45.640]   often falsified on both sides. Both sides. This is wonderful. The temptation to a preacher,
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.800]   you see, is to think that if he's prepared what he regards as a good sermon, it's going
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:55.360]   to be a wonderful service. It sometimes can be a very bad one. On the other end, the poor
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.720]   man may have had a very difficult and a trying week, he may have been ill, a thousand and
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.680]   one things may have happened to him, and he may go into the pulpit in fear and trembling,
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:06.920]   feeling that he hasn't done his work, he's got nothing. And it may be one of the most
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:12.160]   glorious services he's ever had the privilege of conducting. Why? Well, because he doesn't
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:20.260]   control the power. It varies. And not only in preaching, but in daily life and experience.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:24.360]   It is the well of water that is in us, and we don't control it. It controls us. So the
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:31.360]   power, you see, of necessity varies from time to time, even in the same person. You show
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:36.560]   me a person who's always the same, always on the same level, I doubt whether he's a
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:41.800]   Christian at all. Show me a preacher who's always at the same level. He's not much of
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:49.560]   a preacher. A great preacher will sometimes be a very bad preacher. A man who's always
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:55.960]   the same, he's not a true Christian preacher. There's this other element, the element of
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:01.260]   the spirit, the unknown, the unction, the authority, the power. You see, a man with
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.760]   his ability can produce a certain level, but he's always on that level. But here there
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.760]   are variations. You're up, you're down, you're on top of the mountain, you're down in the
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:18.360]   depths. The variation in the power in the same person, the same individual, it is, I say,
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:26.560]   because we don't control this. It is the well of water that is within us, bubbling,
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:33.560]   springing up into everlasting life, and oh, the glory of the possibilities of this power.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:38.960]   Now, let me just quote a few phrases to you before we leave it this morning. This is the
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:45.160]   sort of thing I'm talking about. Here's the height of the power, if you like. The apostles
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:51.360]   went on trial fairly soon after the day of Pentecost, and they prohibited to preach.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:57.760]   And do you remember the immortal answer of Peter? "We cannot but speak." That's the power.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.560]   A man never says a thing like that. "We cannot but speak. We can't help speaking." Why not?
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.160]   Well, not because they've decided that they're going to do this, they were not that sort
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.660]   of people. This man, Peter, was the man who denied his Lord just a few weeks back in order
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:15.760]   to save his life. He was terrified of being arrested, afraid of powers. He now faces this
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:20.560]   anhedron, and he says, "We cannot but speak. It's no use telling us to stop. We can't stop.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:27.860]   We can't help ourselves. We cannot but speak." It's the power. Or listen to the apostle Paul
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:35.960]   putting it in his way, "The love of Christ constraineth me." He's like a man in a vice.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:41.660]   It's being wound up. It's being pressed out of him. "Woe is unto me if I preach not the
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:48.260]   gospel." You see, you don't decide to do these things in cold blood. You don't do them
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:54.260]   mechanically. You're aware of this tremendous pressure, this power, "The love of Christ
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:45:04.460]   constraineth me." Man under pressure. He can't, he cannot desist. "We cannot but speak because
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:09.660]   of this constraining love." Or take it as we heard it at the end of that first chapter
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:14.660]   of the epistle to the Colossians at the beginning. Listen to the apostle, "Whom we preach, the
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:21.160]   Lord Jesus Christ, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:31.460]   every man perfect in Christ Jesus." Then listen, "Whereunto I also labor." Now here's the
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:37.460]   secret. I labor, of course. He does all he can. His preparation, his activities, his
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:45.460]   traveling, his everything. "Whereunto I also labor." Strive, that's strong. Striving goes
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:54.460]   beyond laboring. Striving according to his working, "which worketh in me mightily."
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:46:00.460]   Can't you see it? He's like a volcano. There's a power, there's a fire within him. "Thou
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:05.460]   ant of life and fire." There was a fire within him. Jeremiah speaks of the same thing. "A
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:10.460]   fire in my bones." He decided not to speak again because every time he spoke he got into
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.460]   trouble and was being persecuted. He said, "I'll never speak again." But he said, "I
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:20.460]   couldn't. There was a fire in my bones." I labor, striving according to his working,
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:28.460]   "which worketh in me mightily." Moving him, energizing him, filling him with a divine
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:35.460]   power which carries him along irresistibly in the performance of his task, his great
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:43.460]   and his high calling. My dear friends, do you know anything of this power working in
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:51.460]   you? People in times of revival know it tremendously in their personal experience, but there are
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:56.460]   variations. Don't be discouraged. If it may be low at the present time, examine yourself.
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:47:00.460]   Make sure you're not quenching or grieving the spirit. But even when you've done all
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.460]   that and you're all right, it doesn't guarantee you'll get the power. This idea which teaches
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:10.460]   do this and you'll get that, that's not Christianity. You don't control it. There has been a foolish,
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.460]   false teaching for eighty years or so which has told people, "You'd be willing to be
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:19.460]   willing and you'll get it. Do this, surrender and you've got it." You haven't. You can
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:29.460]   do everything and still be lifeless. "His power, his power that worketh in me mightily
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:38.460]   shall be within you a well of water springing up into everlasting life." The possibilities
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:47.460]   are glorious. They're endless. Realize that secret and don't be satisfied until you know
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:54.460]   the mighty power of the life of God working in your life, lifting you up above, outside
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:48:01.460]   yourself. And what you do will not be works, mechanical works. It'll be the fruit of the
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.460]   Spirit. Amen.
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:08.460]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
