[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.300]   for people of all ages, are there zero cost tools in the form of groups to help people
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.780]   grieve different types of grief? Because I think for some people it's like, I think we've all heard
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.140]   that the ultimate stressor is the loss of a child. And I can only think of one thing that
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.160]   might be equally stressful, if not more stressful, would be not knowing if your child is alive or
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.540]   dead. That to me just seems like the ultimate form of agony. So presumably a bereavement group for that
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.540]   is very different than a bereavement group for someone who's really truly mourning the, I don't
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.680]   know, the separation from a spouse, right? Two different scales of grief, but it's hard to tell
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.860]   someone who's really grieving deeply, like your grief isn't as bad as someone else's grief. So are
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:02.240]   there groups? And then I'll also ask the question I just asked, which is, why is it that knowing
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:11.520]   other people suffer too only provides mild support for grieving? Yeah. There's a fairly recent
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.800]   movement that we might call the public health model of bereavement support. And so the idea here is
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.700]   that, and this largely comes out of Europe, Canada, Australia, where they're trying to actually develop
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:35.080]   health care around bereavement. Part of this is because we can talk about how we know that the
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:44.200]   physical cost of the loss of a loved one is so impactful on us, it can lead to dying of a heart
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.140]   attack, right? So we know that, for example, the day that a loved one dies, you are 21 times more likely
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.180]   to have a heart attack than any other day of your life. 21 times. And we know that in the first three
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.180]   months after the death of his wife, a man is nearly twice as likely to have a fatal heart attack
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.600]   compared to a man who remains married during that same time. Wow. Even if he has other support? Yes.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.020]   Isn't that just crazy? For women, it's about 1.8 times. So still just an astronomical number for medical
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:31.500]   risk. So what we know is this period of transformation is incredibly risky, right? So we can have all this
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.120]   physiological change, but if our body isn't resilient enough, where it actually breaks during that time,
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.640]   this is something we need to get ahead of. So thinking about this public health model of bereavement,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.560]   we can think of sort of at the foundation, even just understanding in a grief literacy kind of way,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:02.480]   what can I expect? What is happening to me? Why is this happening to me? That is a psychoeducation level
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.160]   that is vitally important to people, regardless of sort of how much support they have. Now, many people
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.240]   will go to bereavement support groups even just to get that, right? Even just to get good evidence-based
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:24.060]   information. Places that are no longer teaching the five stages of grieving, for example. And beyond that,
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.340]   we know how important support is. Social support, having loved ones around, just as you were
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.720]   describing. And I think one of the reasons, I mean, imagine in that first seven days after your spouse
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.080]   dies, if there is someone in your house sitting Shiva, they are going to notice if you have a heart
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:53.480]   attack, right? So think about the idea that we might outsource our physiological regulation for a while.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.800]   Think of it this way. When we bond with someone, when you fall in love with your partner, say, for
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:09.600]   example, they become your external pacemaker, right? Think about co-regulation. If I go home now and I get
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.920]   a hug from my partner, just the way you were describing, I know that my blood pressure will drop a little
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.400]   bit. My heart rate will drop a little bit. Now suddenly I have to imagine walking into an empty
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.320]   house where that's not going to happen. My cardiovascular system has to figure out how am I
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.640]   going to walk into my home again and again and again and regulate my heart rate. And your brain is
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.980]   anticipating seeing the person that you lost. Yes, exactly. Like it doesn't, you can know, but the
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:46.160]   action systems, the go circuitry, if it were. All the subconscious processing, I should be, I'm doing
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.000]   the same motion of turning the key in the lock that I've always done. And now there's a hole in the room
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.040]   when I enter it. And often it still smells like them. Absolutely. I think people really underestimate
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.140]   this thing about smell because it's operating at an unconscious level all the time. We're like bathing in
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.060]   somebody else's chemicals and then they're gone and then it starts dissipating. But it's still there for a while.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:22.620]   Absolutely. So I think recognizing your grieving body has to figure out how to regulate again is one reason why
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:39.040]   support is so important. There's a study of primates where, you know, as with other primates, there's a lot of infant
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:48.220]   mortality. And in this observational study, there are troops that are being observed by scientists. And with the death
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:57.200]   of an infant primate, the mother will often carry that deceased infant, that baby monkey, for a long time
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.740]   after their death and spend a lot of time looking at the infant. The mother doesn't groom. She doesn't
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.400]   try to nurse. She's not confused that the infant is alive. But what is interesting is she stops grooming
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.620]   herself during this time. Now, that's actually medically risky for a primate because we know that
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.900]   grooming is so important to their health to get rid of parasites and such. And, you know, usually in these
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.180]   troops, there's a really strict hierarchy. Who gets to groom who is, you know, the latest Kardashian show
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:36.660]   kind of thing. And during this time, when the mother is trying to understand what's happened to this
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:44.820]   infant, the rules go out the window. Any member of the troop can groom this mother. Now, at some point,
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:54.760]   wide individual variation in how long the mother holds this infant from days to months. Once she relinquishes
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:02.060]   the infant, the rules go back into effect. So she goes back to the troop and now she participates in
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:10.920]   social life, in medical social life, in the way that she did before. I think the analogy here, in addition to
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.080]   every time I think about it, it just rips my heart a little bit, right? But the idea here is that it is all of our
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:27.600]   jobs to groom the mourning person, to care for them, to say, hey, how long has it been since you saw your doctor
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.400]   for your regular checkup? How long has it been since you had your mammogram or got your teeth cleaned,
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.860]   right? Often we've been caring for a loved one who's dying and we're neglecting our own medical care.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:46.360]   Because here's the thing. Grief is the natural response. Our bodies are resilient. Many people are
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:54.780]   shocked by how much pain, physical pain, how they get a lump in their throat or they feel like their chest is on
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:02.040]   fire when they're grieving. But actually our bodies are remarkably resilient. We do learn to re-regulate
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:08.780]   without this external pacemaker. But in those instances where the body isn't resilient enough
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:16.500]   to be able to do that, we need people around us supporting us. In a study in my own lab, we thought,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:22.940]   well, probably this risk for a broken heart, this risk of dying of a heart attack, isn't, you know,
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:29.420]   24-7 equally risky. So we brought people into the lab and had them experience a wave of grief while
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:36.360]   they were hooked up to ECG and blood pressure and so forth. And what we saw was everybody's blood
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.600]   pressure goes up during a wave of grief. That's probably not too surprising. But what we saw was
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.400]   the people who, when they walked in the door, told us they were having the most intense grief,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:56.580]   their blood pressure went up the most. And then in a replication study in Germany, we saw that their
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:04.040]   blood pressure didn't recover. So you can see that these waves of grief that our body and our mind and
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:15.200]   our brain have to learn how to cope with and then eventually to adapt to. Those require a physical
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:22.980]   body that can sustain that. They require relationships that can support us and sustain that. And this is
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:29.840]   why I think support is so important, even though it doesn't take away the pain of missing your person,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:37.760]   right? Because we need every resource we can muster in the midst of this moment. Now, it does also mean
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:47.440]   that as much as we are missing our person and it feels so isolating to try and explain that there's a
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:56.320]   hole in the room when no one else can see that hole, it does help at some level to talk to this other
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:03.040]   person who is seeing a different hole in the room, who's also going through grief, because we recognize
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:09.640]   grieving is a human experience. And that you're not connected because you both miss the same person,
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:16.300]   but you are connected because you're both missing, right? And so I think that bereavement support can be
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:23.040]   incredibly helpful to connect with others who are going through this same process. And frankly,
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:31.500]   I don't recommend and some bereavement support groups actually prohibit dating relationships from a grief
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:41.160]   support group. But the reality is the people that we connect with are also people potentially that we
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:49.340]   develop stronger attachment bonds with. That's how community works, right? And so I think bereavement
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:11:01.500]   support can be incredibly important. We do know for the one out of 10 who develop a disordered grieving who
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:10.380]   really are not showing any changes over time, even though time is passing, those people might need a very
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:18.920]   specific evidence-based psychotherapy intervention because we know that those psychology interventions
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.640]   can get us back on a normal or typical grieving trajectory.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:31.980]   So,
