[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   Well, how do we tweet to the glory of God?
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.320]   Uh, surely we all have a lot to learn in stewarding our media
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.240]   platforms for eternal purposes.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.520]   And here's the question as it arrives from Lisa, a regular listener.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.200]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you for this podcast and thank you for
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.640]   your presence on social media.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.680]   I want to reach the people in my online sphere with the gospel.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.040]   What are some simple things average Christians like me can keep in mind to
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.280]   use social media with eternal purpose for evangelism and for edification.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.520]   The last 20 years have created a whole new world of possibilities for good and
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.440]   for ill in broadcasting our thoughts to the world before the internet.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.680]   We could distribute tracts.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.000]   We could use billboards.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880]   We could rent newspaper ads.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.160]   We could write letters to the editor.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.640]   Uh, try to publish an article in a magazine or a book, uh, or write a book.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.240]   Uh, we could distribute doorknob hangers or hire a skywriter or, uh,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.920]   put on a bumper sticker.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.600]   But today we can go to Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and blogging, et
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.920]   cetera, and the possibility exists that something you say might reach thousands,
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.080]   even millions besides the cluster little cluster of friends that you have several
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.640]   dozen folks or several hundred folks that you have now that's a new situation.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.560]   And for Christians, it's another stewardship that God has given us to
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.160]   manage, to steward, and he will call us to account.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.400]   Jesus says for every careless word, we utter Matthew 12 36 careless words on
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.440]   Twitter or Facebook or in blogs.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:02.320]   So the best way to know how to manage or steward God's gift is as always to go to
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.640]   God's word and listen to his counsel.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.960]   So what I'm going to do for the next few minutes is just prime the pump for Lisa,
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.760]   who asked this question and for others who are listening, prime the pump so that
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.120]   you can carry on what I start here.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.960]   And my guess is that someone could easily write up like Jonathan Edwards, 70
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.080]   resolutions for the internet.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.320]   Waiting for that to hear it.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.080]   Tony, maybe you, you should do that.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.200]   20, 70 resolutions for, for the internet and all of them should be biblically
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.080]   warranted, biblically grounded.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.600]   So here's a start for those of you who want to make this your, your goal.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:56.000]   Lisa specifically asked at the end of her question for guidance about evangelism
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.240]   and edification.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.000]   I was so glad to hear those traditional words.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   They're very good words used.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.760]   That's a great pair of goals to have when you're on the internet.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.360]   Speaking words that evangelism, that is display the good news about Christ and
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.880]   his way for unbelievers and seek to build up.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.920]   That's what edify means.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.280]   Build up in, in faith and hope and love, build up believers into wiser, stronger,
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.360]   into wiser, stronger disciples of Jesus.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.640]   So here are a few texts from the Bible that I think give good guidance for, for
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.760]   not only what we say, but how we say it when we, when we use social media, the
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.080]   mandate for evangelism locally and globally.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.160]   First Peter 2, 9, you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.680]   people of God's own possession.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.560]   Why?
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.760]   That you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.800]   his marvelous light.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.480]   So there we go.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.040]   The mandate proclaim through social media, the excellencies of Jesus.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.120]   I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.920]   I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.240]   I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.120]   congregation.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.360]   So Psalm 40 verse 10 saying, I don't keep things to myself that I see in God's word
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.560]   and that he's done for me.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.200]   I broadcast them to the great congregation.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.480]   Proverbs 15, 7 puts it like this, the lips of the wise, and I looked up the Hebrew
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.720]   word here, it's spread in the ESV.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.600]   It's the word for scattering seed.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.160]   It's almost always used for scattering seed.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.240]   The lips of the wise scatter.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.560]   Like you take a handful of seed, throw it out there on the ground.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.600]   So let me read it without all my comments.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.080]   The lips of the wise spread knowledge.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.520]   Not so the heart of fools.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.200]   So we should just scatter to the winds with Twitter and Facebook scatter seed,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.400]   like knowledge to the wind of the internet.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:30.320]   Or Acts 5, 28, where the leaders in Israel charge the disciples like this, we
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.960]   strictly charge you not to teach in this name, Jesus.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.760]   Yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.280]   Oh, I love that phrase.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.440]   Fill your city, fill your city, fill your nation, fill your Twitter feed and your
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.400]   Facebook with the teaching of Christianity.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.000]   Laden things down with truth.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.360]   Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:07.840]   I mean, if God wills, you have a chance to touch somebody anywhere in the world with
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.600]   what you say.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.320]   And the Bible says, "Declare his glory among the nations."
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.080]   Do that.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.280]   Psalm 96, verse 3.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.920]   What a possibility exists for touching someone 10,000 miles away, supposedly
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.360]   outside our reach.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.120]   So pray over your tweets, pray over your blogging and your Facebook, pray over it
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:39.400]   that God would breathe on it and send it by his appointed means to somebody who has
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.120]   exactly a need for what you have said.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.080]   That's the way I do.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.520]   I put tweets in my scheduler almost every day, and they come from the Bible, almost
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.080]   90% of them, and I'm saying, "God, do something extraordinary with this verse.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.680]   Make it be timed perfect for somebody's need."
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:09.480]   Both proclamation, as we've been talking about, but also defense of the gospel,
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.960]   because it says in 1 Peter 3, 15, "Always be prepared to make a defense to anyone
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.080]   who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.760]   and respect."
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.720]   So there's a place online for answering objections and responding to people
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.120]   gently and respectfully so that you can show error where you see it and defend the
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.800]   gospel.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.000]   And there's a place for exposing sin.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.840]   Ephesians 5, 11, "Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness or don't join
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.360]   into the darkness of the web, but instead expose them."
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.520]   Now, I don't think the dominant tone of your life on the internet should be
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.400]   exposing darkness.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.200]   You're going to get your hands and your heart dirty that way.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.840]   But periodically, God's going to burden you that something you saw needs to be set
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   right, and you're going to expose some sin.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:13.120]   So all of that, having to do mainly with evangelism and outreach, what about
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.040]   edification?
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:21.000]   Romans 14, 19, "So let us pursue what makes for peace and mutual upbuilding."
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.640]   Oh, what a great mandate for your internet interaction.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.320]   Or Ephesians 4, 29, "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouth, but only what
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:38.000]   is good for upbuilding as fits the occasion, that it may minister grace to
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.800]   those who hear."
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.400]   Or John 17, 17, "Sanctify them in the truth.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   Your word is truth."
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.560]   Or John 8, 32, "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:56.160]   So we fill our mouths, our Twitter feed, our Facebook with Scripture accurately
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.280]   cited, wisely interpreted.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.840]   This is the safest way to do good.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.440]   Minimize yourself, maximize God and His Word.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   I'm going to say that one again, because broadcasting is so much self, and we have
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:17.880]   to work at checking our hearts again and again, "Am I just wanting to be seen, just
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.520]   wanting to be known?"
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.880]   Like standing on the street corner like the Pharisees, blowing our trumpet, wanting
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:29.920]   everybody to see what we say, or are we minimizing ourself by maximizing what does
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.400]   God say, what is God like?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.400]   And then be vigilant over your tongue.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.440]   Matthew 12, 34, "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.840]   Oh my!
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.560]   You may not know it, but you are revealing yourself all day long.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.520]   What kind of person is this?
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.100]   Is this a feisty person?
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.480]   An angry person, a cynical person?
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.560]   A mean person?
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   A gentle person?
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.560]   A kind person?
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   A loving person?
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   A whole person?
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.560]   A broken person?
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.280]   I mean, what comes out of your mouth shows what's inside.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.600]   That's the way the world is going to read it.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.800]   The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:22.720]   Our aim is life, not self-exaltation, but other people enjoying life in Christ.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.680]   So how then, what kind of guidelines for how you talk?
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.120]   Not just what, but how.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.400]   And here's just a few examples.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:38.000]   Ephesians 4, 15, "speaking the truth in love we grow up in every way into Christ."
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.320]   So truth in love, truth in love.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:48.080]   Proverbs 16, 24, "gracious words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.600]   to the body."
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:56.240]   Colossians 4, 6, "let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt."
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:03.040]   Proverbs 16, 21, "the wise heart is called discerning, the sweetness of speech increases
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.640]   persuasiveness."
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:14.560]   Proverbs 15, 4, "a gentle tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness breaks the spirit."
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:21.520]   Colossians 3, 16, "let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching, admonishing
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:27.120]   one another in all wisdom and singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.120]   in your hearts to God."
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:35.440]   And what I would underline there is, do people detect that you are a brimmingly thankful
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.600]   person?
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.320]   Thankful for God, thankful for eyes, thankful for ears, thankful for mind, thankful for
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.600]   heart, thankful for the gospel, thankful for church, thankful for country, thankful for
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.160]   friends, just brimming.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:58.200]   Or are you a sick heart, always, always giving evidence that you're angry about something?
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.840]   Proverbs 25, 11, "a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of silver,"
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:10.920]   which simply means timing, tone, content are crucial.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.440]   And finally, "let everything be done in love," 1 Corinthians 16, 14.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:23.600]   When I think about my Twitter presence, for example, I think not only about the content
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:32.000]   and tone of each tweet, which vary a lot, I mean, sometimes they're very severe in
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.840]   pointing out the judgment of God, sometimes they're very tender in reaching out to the
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:43.600]   brokenhearted, but what I do is look not only at each tweet, but at the overall effect of
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:50.920]   thousands of tweets over years, I think, what are we at, 17,000 so far, something like that?
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:58.240]   Any given word from the Bible can be misused by anyone, anytime, you can't avoid that.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:05.280]   My hope is that the overall impact will be for the magnifying of Christ, the winning
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:12.000]   of the lost, the everlasting holy joy of God's people, and the glory of God.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.840]   That's the overall impact of my presence that I hope God will do.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.840]   Amen.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.960]   Taking a long view of what seems so immediately ephemeral, Pastor John, thank you for that
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   perspective.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.880]   Well, this is our 10th episode, talking about Twitter and social media, all of which, those
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:35.560]   episodes can be found in our podcast archive at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.360]   And there you can explore all of our now 1,200 past episodes, you can scan through a list
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.600]   of our most popular episodes of all time, which is a list that's updated every day,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.120]   and you can read full transcripts of most of those episodes, and you can even send us
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.920]   a question of your own from there.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.160]   Again, that's at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.

[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   Well, isn't a drug user and a Godward joy seeker just two different kinds of junkies
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.280]   who both seek new highs, new spikes in an immediate experience for which they cannot
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.680]   sustain beyond a fleeting moment?
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.000]   Well, now there's an interesting question for John Paver.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.240]   I'm your host Tony Reiki, and we'll see you back here on Friday with that one.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   [end]
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:37.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
