[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   The last card I'm going to mention is the Alliant Credit Union Visa Signature Card.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.080]   And I don't know anyone that has this card.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.280]   I've never had this card.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.760]   I've never had an account at Alliant.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.920]   But the one interesting thing is it is a 2.5% cash back on everything card.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.480]   It does have a few hoops that you have to jump through, but no annual fee,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.640]   no foreign transaction fees, does have some travel protections.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640]   It does not have a sign up bonus.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.120]   And so if for whatever reason, none of the other options make sense for you.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.280]   I said at the outset, I'm going to talk about cards
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.320]   that earn more than 2% on everything.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.800]   I think this qualifies because it's 2.5%.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.880]   The only catch is it's only on up to $10,000 per billing cycle.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.680]   I know that's plenty for most people.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.440]   So I thought it was worth including.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.920]   After that, it rolls over to 1.5%.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.920]   The requirements you need to jump through to make this work is you do need to enroll
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.840]   in e-statements and then you do need to open up their high rate checking account,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.120]   which is not very high rate.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.520]   It's 0.25%.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.680]   And you need to have one deposit a month.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.360]   And that could be a direct deposit, an ATM deposit, a mobile check deposit,
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.040]   or even a transfer from another bank.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.800]   And you need to maintain a balance of $1,000 or more.
