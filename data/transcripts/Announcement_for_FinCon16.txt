[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   Good morning, Radicals.
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.320]   This is Joshua Sheets, September 21, 2016, early on Wednesday morning here, working in
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.320]   my home office.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.200]   I'm getting on an airplane later today.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.920]   Today's actually my son's third birthday, so I'm taking the day off and we're taking
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.600]   him to the zoo to celebrate his third birthday, having a small birthday party.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.600]   And then this afternoon, I'm getting on an airplane and flying out to San Diego for FinCon
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.220]   2016.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.220]   So quick update.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.640]   One, I apologize for the lack of shows last week and this week.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.520]   I have not intentionally taken the time off.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.200]   I've just been a little bit overwhelmed, and so I apologize.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.840]   I feel like that's kind of been the theme of the last year, and I'm making progress
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.480]   toward that regard.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.320]   Some people have said, "Hey, Joshua, where are all the shows?"
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.560]   And some people have said, "Wow, it's great.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.560]   I can finally keep up with you."
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.840]   So no matter what I do, I guess I please some people and don't please others.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.420]   So I haven't intentionally pulled back to the very small number of shows.
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.780]   Last week, I published two.
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.500]   This week, I had intended to have five or six out, but my apologies.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.900]   I'm still working and learning, and I'm doing the best that I can.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.360]   But I'm behind as far as flying out of town.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.780]   So first, just want to let you know that, and I apologize for that.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.340]   Number two, if you're going to be in San Diego, I would love to meet up with you.
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.740]   Or if you are in San Diego, even if you're not planning to come to the FinCon, Financial
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.180]   Bloggers usually formally knows the Financial Bloggers Conference, but it's probably the
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.580]   big premier conference for my little industry here, financial media, and new financial media
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.580]   especially.
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.580]   Even if you're not in FinCon, just want to let you know and give you a heads up that
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.100]   I will be in San Diego.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.660]   And my entire purpose for coming to FinCon is to hang out with all of y'all, listeners
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.900]   of this show.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.520]   So I will be extremely available.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.900]   Please reach out to me on Twitter would be the best way.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.700]   Reach out to me on Twitter @JoshuaSheets.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.280]   Remember my name is spelled S-H-E-A-T-S.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.720]   So my Twitter username is @JoshuaSheets.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.060]   But if you're in the San Diego area, or if you will be at FinCon, please know that I
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.780]   am coming to FinCon to hang out with you.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.540]   I'll be completely flexible.
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.060]   I have very few scheduled appointments, and I'll be very available.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.460]   So reach out to me on Twitter and set something up.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.660]   If you see me in the hallway, make sure to come and see me, and please introduce yourself
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.020]   I'm coming for the purpose of hanging out with all of you who are listeners.
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.700]   One of the best things about doing a podcast is I can create lots of content and share
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.060]   it with other people.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.740]   One of the worst things is that it's often one-way content.
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.300]   So when I go to events like this, I like to do that so I can just listen to you and hear
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.380]   your story.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.620]   So I won't be interested in much in talking about me.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.940]   I'll be interested in listening to you.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.060]   So please, if you're in the San Diego area, I will be in San Diego for Thursday, Friday,
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.060]   and Saturday.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.060]   Saturday night, I'm taking the Red Eye back to West Palm Beach.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.620]   So Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in the San Diego area, reach out to me on Twitter.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.580]   If you want to have breakfast with me, lunch with me, dinner with me, I have a couple of
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.820]   scheduled things, but I will make myself extremely available, and I'll put out announcements
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.460]   on social media about where I'm going to be.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.420]   So I would love to meet up with you, and I will get shows published as I am able.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.140]   And my sincere apologies for the lack of shows this week.
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.300]   continue to improve things here at Radical Personal Finance HQ and make them better in
