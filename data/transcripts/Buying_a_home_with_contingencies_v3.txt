[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.980]   And in this episode, I wanna talk about buying a home
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.200]   with contingencies, whether it's financing contingencies
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.520]   or home inspection contingencies.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.160]   There are actually many types of contingencies.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.100]   And the reason why I am talking about this specific topic
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.560]   is because I think it was overlooked as one of my posts.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.800]   Maybe it's summertime or maybe I just didn't write the post
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.360]   insightful and entertaining enough.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.560]   But this is one of the most important posts you can read
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.260]   if you're looking to buy a home ever, okay?
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.620]   Ever, I'm not just talking about right now, but ever.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.280]   For most people, I think they go into a home
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.960]   and buy it with contingencies.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.000]   But for me, I haven't bought a home with contingencies
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.120]   in I would say the past three homes.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000]   So that's a long time.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.720]   The last time I bought a home with contingencies
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.800]   was my very first home
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.060]   because I didn't really know what to look for.
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.920]   But now that I've remodeled,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.220]   gut remodeled multiple homes before,
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.060]   I've met with multiple inspectors, plumbing,
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.640]   electrical, building, and city inspectors.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.360]   I know what to look for when buying a home.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.520]   Therefore, having a home inspection contingency
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.240]   is not as necessary in a competitive market.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.480]   Now, markets turn, real estate cycles go up and down.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.800]   And currently, there's a lull on the coast,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.760]   at least here in San Francisco.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.800]   And so I'm trying to take advantage and upgrade homes
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.060]   because I love real estate.
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.040]   I love to enjoy the house that I live in
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.240]   and potentially make money.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.620]   I think it's the best usage of your funds.
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.620]   Whereas stocks, yeah, it goes up, but then it goes down.
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.240]   You never really gain any utility.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.400]   So I'm in the process of buying a home
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.200]   and I was able to get into contract with a contingency,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.880]   a home inspection contingency.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.080]   And it's very eye-opening for me
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.120]   because I haven't written about this in the past
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.280]   and I wanna help you think as a real estate investor
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.560]   how you can really profit when you have a contingency.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.720]   All right, once your offer is accepted with a contingency,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.560]   you must send an earnest money deposit
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.200]   equal to one to 3% of the value of the home
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.520]   to an escrow company.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.620]   This is to protect both parties.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.160]   The escrow company holds the money
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.280]   until all contract conditions are met on both sides.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.560]   And please know before wiring any money,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.880]   call the escrow company
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.440]   and confirm the wiring instruction before sending.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.240]   I've seen horror stories about folks wiring money
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.980]   to wrong accounts because the emails,
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.940]   the emails were getting intercepted by some hacker.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.320]   So just be careful, call ahead, confirm, confirm, confirm.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.220]   And then contingencies are conditions
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.040]   written in your real estate offer letter
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.320]   to protect yourself from losing your earnest money deposit.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.960]   It's usually about 3% earnest money deposit.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.360]   So for example, if for some reason
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.920]   the bank decides not to lend you money,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.760]   if you have a financing contingency,
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.480]   you have a penalty free out.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.760]   So in other words, you can not buy the home
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.880]   and you can get all your 3%
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.560]   or whatever percent earnest money deposit back.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.620]   Now let's say you have a home inspection contingency
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.020]   and you find during your due diligence,
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.600]   there's a leak, a damaged part of the roof
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.240]   and the seller isn't willing to fix it or pay for it
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.200]   or negotiate a lower price.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.160]   Well, you have the option, penalty free,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.720]   of withdrawing your offer
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.580]   and getting your earnest money deposit back.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.200]   Such contingencies have expiration dates, note that.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.560]   And when that date comes,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.800]   the prospective buyer must sign a document
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.120]   that releases the contingencies.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.160]   It's not a, oh, we got to that date,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.840]   it automatically expires,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.880]   the earnest money deposit is mine if you don't buy it.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.720]   You have to look at the document and sign.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.320]   It's usually a docusign, electric signature,
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.960]   where you say, I release contingencies.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.660]   So then after that,
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.660]   your earnest money deposit is at risk.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.660]   Therefore, it is vital, vital, vital
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.080]   that before you release any contingencies,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.400]   you get all your ducks in order,
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.760]   you do your due diligence thoroughly.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.040]   So obviously from a home seller's perspective,
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.720]   they prefer not to have any contingencies in the offer,
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.400]   no financing, no home inspection contingencies.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.920]   In a hot market, they could afford that.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.880]   People just wanted to get in.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.160]   And if you offered contingencies,
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.920]   well, it made your offer uncompetitive.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.960]   But now, finally, if you've been renting all these years,
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.840]   if you've been waiting for the right time to buy,
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.840]   well, because mortgage rates are averaging,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.160]   supposedly 7% for an average 30-year fixed,
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.960]   the demand has waned because affordability has decreased.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.640]   7%, it's not super high in a historical context.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.200]   I remember getting a 6.5% mortgage rate
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.440]   in, what's that, 2003, 2004, 2005.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.840]   I thought I was fine.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.400]   And home prices still went up before, of course,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.720]   the 2008, 2009 crash.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.280]   But from a historical perspective,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.320]   mortgage rates are not high.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.240]   But from a recency perspective,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.640]   given we could have all refinanced under 3%
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.040]   for a 30-year fixed, it does feel high.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.560]   So demand is softer in some regions of the country,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.040]   most notably on the West Coast.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.560]   And so, therefore, homebuyers have an opportunity
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.760]   to buy if they have the down payment
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.560]   or if they have a lot of cash to pay cash, all cash for a home.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.040]   Now, why do I say buying a home with contingencies
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.000]   is like getting a free call option?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.280]   Well, call options are financial contracts
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.440]   that give the option buyer the right
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.520]   but not the obligation to buy a stock, a bond, a commodity,
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.600]   or other asset at a specified price
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.680]   within a specific time period.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.080]   A call buyer profits when the underlying asset increases
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.360]   in price.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.160]   And in this case, this podcast episode,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.800]   the underlying asset is a house.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.560]   And I want you to click over to the post,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.400]   and you can just see a chart that
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.480]   highlights how you make money through buying a call option.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.560]   Once you send in your earnest money deposit
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.960]   and get your offer accepted with contingencies,
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.800]   you don't have much downside risk
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.760]   at all until the contingencies are removed.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.800]   You now have the free call option
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.840]   to buy the property at an agreed upon price at no cost to you.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.560]   You're in escrow period, right?
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.080]   And the average escrow period is something around 30 to 45 days.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.080]   But I've seen it go to 90 days or even longer.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.280]   At the same time, you have the upside profit potential
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.640]   as time goes on.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.680]   Time here is a huge variable in a call option.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.320]   So in order to potentially make the most money off a home
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.000]   as possible, you want to have as long of an escrow
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.200]   period as possible.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.520]   So that's time.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.320]   To do so, one strategy is to input long contingency
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.400]   durations.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.560]   And then another strategy is to extend the escrow period
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.960]   as many times as possible.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.080]   So now you're asking, well, why?
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.440]   Why is the free call option more valuable the longer
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.160]   the contingency duration, the longer the escrow period?
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.560]   Well, it's because the more time you have,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.440]   the more time you get to make a more informed home
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.000]   buying decision.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.640]   So imagine getting into contract to buy
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.000]   $1 million worth of the S&P 500 index at a strike price of $4,500.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.360]   If the contract lasts only 30 days, that's not a lot of time.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.160]   You wouldn't be willing to pay a lot for that contract
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.240]   to buy $1 million worth of the S&P 500 index.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.600]   I calculate maybe it's worth $8,000, or 0.8%
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.440]   of the value of the purchasing power.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.080]   All right, now, let's say you have a call option
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.040]   to buy $1 million of the S&P 500 index at a strike price of $4,500,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.080]   but the duration is 10 years.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.720]   You have 10 years to decide whether you want
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.840]   to buy $1 million at $4,500.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.800]   At a 7.2% annual rate of return, the S&P
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.720]   will have doubled in 10 years.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.320]   So that $1 million will have gone to $2 million.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.120]   Hence, the value of the contract is much greater
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   than the previous example of $8,000,
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.800]   because it only lasted 30 days.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.600]   With a 10-year option, you might be
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.440]   willing to pay $500,000, $600,000, $700,000
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.280]   to have the option to buy $1 million at $4,500,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.160]   because the probability, based on historical returns, 7.2%,
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.040]   it's kind of in the realm.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.720]   And if it's below that, well, you
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   can calculate your break-even cost.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.720]   And if it's above that, you're going to make a lot more money.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.960]   So you can extend this type of thinking to buying a home.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.320]   Let's say you put down a $30,000 earnest money
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.520]   deposit to buy a $1 million home, 3% earnest money deposit.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.000]   The contingency duration is 45 days for buyer's investigations.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.600]   And after the contingency duration expires,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.200]   you then have another 15 days to come up with all the funds
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.720]   to close, because that's what's written for the close
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.760]   of escrow target date.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.080]   Now, without an extension, the total escrow period is 60 days.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.920]   Now, let's say during this 60-day process--
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.080]   or let's just say 45-day process for the contingencies--
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.200]   that there's peace in Ukraine.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.040]   In addition, the federal government
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.000]   announces it's going to do another quantitative easing
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.120]   for some reason with a surprise $3 million stimulus package
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   to create more jobs.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.160]   After all, it's election year coming up.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.800]   You've got to buy your votes, right?
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.440]   So due to these two factors, the S&P 500 rises by 10%.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.640]   10% in 60 days is huge.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.840]   That's a raging bull market.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.880]   Now, with a lot more wealth created in the economy
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.040]   during this 45- to 60-day period,
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.960]   the value of your home might have appreciated
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.400]   by another 3%.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.520]   Now, if that's the case, you absolutely
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.040]   want to buy that house.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.280]   It's a free call option to buy it at 3% below market value.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.040]   Now, let's look at it the other way.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.200]   During the 45-day contingency period,
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.880]   let's say China decides to invade Taiwan.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.080]   In addition, a major employer near the house's neighborhood
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.880]   you want to buy decides to shut down, and 5,000 jobs are lost.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.120]   As a result, the S&P 500 declines by 20%
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.560]   during this 45-day contingency period.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.040]   In this situation, the value of your house
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:42.240]   may have depreciated by 5% to 7%, or $50,000 to $70,000
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.160]   on a million-dollar house.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.200]   So what are you going to do now?
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.040]   Well, if you choose not to drop your contingencies,
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.640]   you can walk away.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.000]   You can also negotiate for a lower purchase price.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.960]   There are no standard contingencies
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.080]   for exogenous variables like war,
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.000]   although you could write one into the contract.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.640]   Anything is negotiable.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.600]   But if you have a contingency in your offer,
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.360]   you can always find an excuse not to move forward,
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.920]   not to buy the house, or not to pay the price you agreed upon.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.480]   Everything is negotiable.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.760]   These examples should help illustrate,
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.080]   from a financial perspective, why sellers want faster closes
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.840]   and why buyers should want longer closes.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.880]   The more time a buyer has to survey market conditions,
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.720]   the more ammunition buyers have to make an optimal home
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.520]   purchase decision.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.120]   Now, technically, there is some opportunity cost
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.800]   after sending in your earnest money
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.840]   deposit to get into contract.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.720]   That opportunity cost is the income
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.760]   or returns you could have made if you had invested down
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.200]   payment instead.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.360]   And with rates at 5-plus percent,
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.400]   that opportunity cost is significant for a large down
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.520]   payment.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.080]   Some states do require escrow to pay an interest
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.400]   on the earnest money deposit, but the rates are very low.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.000]   I checked here in San Francisco, California,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.240]   and escrow is required to pay something like 0.1%.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.120]   So who cares?
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.440]   That is a PITA.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.880]   Although there is minimum financial downside risk
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.040]   if you make an offer with contingencies,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.360]   there's also the cost of your time
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.520]   and the added stress you may feel in buying a home.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.720]   So if you're not one to like contract negotiations,
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.200]   negotiating, making people sweat,
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   and dashing your dreams and hope,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.880]   well, this sort of buying strategy,
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.280]   of buying with contingencies and extending and negotiating,
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.840]   isn't going to be very pleasant.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.720]   But if you're like me, who loves to write about real estate,
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.900]   who loves to buy real estate, who loves to get a good deal,
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.720]   and who loves to understand the various strategies involved
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.720]   to help y'all, listeners and readers,
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.640]   get a better real estate deal for yourself,
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.680]   well then, this to me is a goldmine process that I love.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.240]   Let me share a real life example of my escrow process.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   Back in April 2020, I stumbled across my primary residence.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.600]   It was listed, I think it was in mid-April, right?
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.960]   And I said, "Wow, this is a great house.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.360]   "Panoramic ocean views on all three floors,
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.820]   "nice space, good for work from home.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.160]   "What a great house, I wanna buy it."
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.800]   And I talked to the listing agent over a course
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.880]   of maybe five sessions, private sessions, 12 hours,
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.320]   and we developed a working relationship.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.480]   And ultimately, I let him represent me through dual agency.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.680]   And he really fought for me.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.320]   It was pretty amazing, because he convinced the seller
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.120]   to go with my offer, which was $100,000 lower
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.760]   than a competing offer, for various reasons too.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.320]   And so I got into contract, and I just realized
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.960]   I did have a contingency.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.200]   I had a financing contingency.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.760]   And the financing contingency was that I would get financed
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.160]   by a bank for the rest of the payment of the house.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.720]   I put down, I think it was 40%, and I financed 60%.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.600]   And that was a strong down payment that went in my favor.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.440]   And I was going with a big bank,
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.680]   which also went in my favor.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.520]   So the seller was like, "Oh, big bank,
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.640]   "you got a good down payment.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.600]   "We're gonna go with you, not this other potential buyer."
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.120]   So we got into contract in June, beginning in June 2020,
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.360]   and it was a 30-day close.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.440]   30 days is reasonable if you have financing contingency.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.220]   And about the last week of the 30-day close,
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.080]   I started to get cold feet, because if you can recall,
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.920]   June 2020, things were still under lockdown.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.640]   Things were still uncertain.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.080]   I think many of us hoped we would have one week,
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.720]   two week lockdown, maybe one or two or three months max,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.320]   but not April, May, June, third month of lockdown, right?
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.400]   So I was thinking to myself,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.680]   man, is this the right move to spend more money on a home
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.160]   we don't really need, although we were going through
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.880]   a gut me remodel process with our existing home
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.980]   on the downstairs floor?
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.220]   Is this a good idea to spend this much money on a home
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.120]   while we're still under lockdown?
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.420]   And so I said, "Well, let me see if I can extend escrow."
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.600]   So essentially, that's what I did for another 30 days,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.480]   because I wanted to buy myself time
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.920]   to get the right financing,
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.120]   but also to see if the stock market and the economy recover
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.840]   and if the government would step in.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.200]   And so every single week, the market started rebounding
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.160]   after, what was it, March 18 meltdown, right, for 30 days.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.760]   And then after that, so at the end of April
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.320]   and then May, June, things started to recover,
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.560]   especially since the government stepped in
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.120]   with their bazookas with economic stimulus.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.400]   So this time, buying more time
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.320]   gave me more confidence to buy this house.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.840]   And as a result, it ended up being a optimal,
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.840]   or at least a good financial decision,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.800]   because home prices increased since mid 2020.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.080]   So if you're planning to buy a house in this lull,
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.960]   I would suggest buying one with a contingency
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.440]   and have the longest contingency possible.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.520]   You need to calculate the probabilities
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.080]   of a couple things as well.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.400]   One is the probability the home will close
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.640]   by a certain date, your escrow closing date.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.000]   And then two, the probability
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.640]   of you actually purchasing the home.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.000]   If you're like me, you like to look at a lot of properties.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.320]   You sometimes spray and pray and make offers
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.140]   on overpriced or underpriced properties.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.480]   You never know unless you give an offer
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.620]   and you see what happens, right?
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.080]   I've seen many homes sell for below what I thought.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.240]   And I was kicking myself thinking,
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.120]   man, I should have put an offer on the home
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.220]   for a competitive price.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.800]   Anyway, the reason why you need to calculate
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.360]   your probabilities of when the home will close
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.840]   and whether you will actually purchase the home
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.240]   is because you've got to figure out
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.160]   how you're gonna invest your down payment.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.720]   For most people, your down payment
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.700]   is your sacred down payment.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.000]   If it's 20%, you should probably have
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.120]   the vast majority of it in cash.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.340]   80 to 100%.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.640]   But for other folks who like to take
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.280]   a little bit more risk, you can have some of it
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.280]   in liquid stocks, index funds, whatever it is you want.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.360]   It just depends on your risk tolerance.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.600]   Because the higher the probability you plan to buy the home,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.400]   the lower the percentage of your down payment money
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.860]   should go to risk assets.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.960]   And then vice versa.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.840]   If you think there's only like a 20% probability
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.600]   you're gonna buy the home
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.360]   because the seller has to go through a lot of hoops
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.160]   due to the contingency as well,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.560]   you can invest more like you normally would with your money.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   After all, let's say 2023, S&P 500 is up 20%.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.120]   You don't want to just be twiddling your thumbs
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.440]   and having it all cash while the market is up so much.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.600]   You would miss out on a lot,
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.080]   especially if you're paying all cash for a home.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.320]   So these are some things to think about
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.560]   as you manage to buy a home with contingencies.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.520]   The more stocks and other risk assets
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.560]   go up for your down payment fund,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.680]   the cheaper the home and vice versa.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.200]   Don't forget to calculate your future cash flow
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.020]   as well as how many other assets you can move around
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.360]   in terms of shifting assets from stocks
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.520]   or other investments to buying your home.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.840]   The more assets you have, obviously,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.080]   the more risk you can take on the down payment of your home.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.400]   Alrighty, folks, I hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   It really helps if you can think about buying a home
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.360]   like an investor with a lot of money at stake.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.480]   Yes, we mostly buy homes to enjoy,
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.400]   create memories, raise our children,
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   take care of our parents and our family members,
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.160]   but let's be frank here.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.560]   A home is likely the most expensive asset
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.400]   you will buy in your life.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   So it behooves you to think like a rational, savvy investor.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.320]   And this is part of the reason why I'm recording this podcast.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.120]   It's actually the main reason why.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.080]   I don't want y'all to lose money on a home.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.840]   I want y'all to enjoy your home
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.600]   and make money in the future.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.320]   Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.
