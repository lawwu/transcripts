[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.120]   Happy Monday.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.840]   If you live in the prosperous West,
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.160]   you are blessed like very few people have ever been blessed
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.600]   in the history of the world.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.640]   There's a glut of digital technologies that we have,
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.120]   like the chain of technology we're using right now
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.480]   to communicate with one another.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.400]   More importantly, things like infant
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.180]   and child mortality rates are lower than ever.
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.280]   And life expectancy rates have peaked
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.500]   and are projected to keep rising.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.180]   Here in America, few, if any people die of starvation.
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.760]   Famines are unheard of here.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.480]   Motor vehicle fatalities have been in steep decline
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.500]   for the past 50 years, same with plane related deaths.
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.720]   Poverty rates in the States have plummeted
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.960]   in the past 50 years.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.220]   National GDP continues to go up and to the right.
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.200]   Life is as safe as ever.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.940]   We are some of the most comfortable people
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.620]   who have ever existed on this planet.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.640]   And all these blessings together raise questions
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.260]   for Christians who are promised
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260]   that they will suffer in this life.
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.260]   A listener named Marissa is trying to work all this out
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.100]   for herself.
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.100]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.420]   I'm leading a Bible study through First Peter right now.
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.700]   As you know, Peter makes it very clear
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.240]   that Christians will suffer, just as Christ did.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.240]   I'm curious how we Christians suffer
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.780]   in a first world country like America,
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.200]   where we are not physically persecuted for our beliefs.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.940]   I don't think I've ever really suffered
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.800]   for the sake of Christ.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.680]   Feelings get hurt on social media.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.760]   There's a cultural pushback, of course,
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.040]   but I've never lost anything of value in this world
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.880]   due to being a Christian.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.480]   Does this make me a weak or a lazy Christian?
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.000]   Or should I simply thank God for the rare peace
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.280]   I have enjoyed in this age?
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.100]   Such an important question for those of us
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.760]   who live in what, without exaggeration,
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.420]   we could call the Disney world of the nations.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.280]   Even the poor in America, by comparison,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.600]   live in luxury compared to 600 million extremely poor people
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.460]   with no access to adequate food, shelter, medical care,
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.460]   clean water, education, not to mention the saving message
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.320]   of Jesus that they don't have access to.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.160]   One of the reasons I live where I live
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.380]   in a poorer part of Minneapolis is because I dread
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.000]   becoming oblivious to the brokenness
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.740]   and the neediness of the world.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.060]   So here are five things that I see in the Bible
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.820]   to give guidance to those of us who live
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.580]   in relative comfort and security and wealth.
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.780]   One, both Jesus and the apostles said
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.140]   that if we are faithful Christians,
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.540]   we will experience some measure of persecution
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.160]   and other kinds of suffering in the path of obedience.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.860]   Paul said in 2 Timothy 3:12,
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.140]   "All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.540]   "will be persecuted."
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.500]   They will be.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.160]   Jesus said in Matthew 10, 25,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.240]   "If you have called the master of the house Beelzebul,
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.220]   "how much more will they malign those of his household?"
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.420]   In John 15, 20, he said, "If they persecuted me,
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.780]   "they will also persecute you."
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.300]   And Paul taught in Acts 14, 22,
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.900]   that every new believer, through many tribulations,
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.020]   we must enter the kingdom of God.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.020]   If we never taste any affliction or persecution
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.460]   or maligning for Christ's sake,
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.540]   we probably are not pressing into the darkness
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.460]   of the world for Christ as far as we should.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.420]   Number two, Jesus calls us to a kind of death
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.960]   to our old selves into a new life of joyful self-denial.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:29.160]   Not morose self-denial, not self-pitying,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.740]   but joyful self-denial.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.680]   Matthew 16, 24, "If anyone would come after me,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.680]   "let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.140]   "For whoever would save his life will lose it,
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.960]   "and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   So we don't just wait for others to persecute us
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.020]   and take away our pleasures and privileges and securities.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.140]   Instead, we voluntarily make choices
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.540]   that deny ourselves some of these things,
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.020]   freely, willingly, joyfully,
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.700]   in order to serve others.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.760]   Jesus said in Luke 6, 27, "Love your enemies.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.600]   "Do good to those who hate you.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.780]   "Bless those who curse you.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.780]   "Pray for those who abuse you."
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.780]   Doing good, doing good, actually doing things good
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.660]   for those who hate you is costly.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.060]   You might say it is a freely chosen embrace
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.720]   of being disliked.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.620]   Whether it's outright persecution or not,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.520]   it demands self-denial.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.360]   Doing good to other people who don't like us is hard.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.220]   It's costly.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.100]   It's like persecution.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.540]   It's like affliction.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.740]   There is always someone to bless in this world,
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.500]   someone who doesn't like you,
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.440]   who would be easier not to bless.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.280]   Number three.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.120]   Paul said that he had learned not only how to be abased,
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.280]   but also how to abound.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.440]   Philippians 4, 11, "I have learned in whatever situation
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.740]   "I am to be content.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.740]   "I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.480]   "In any and every circumstance,
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.940]   "I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger,
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.700]   "abundance and need.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.640]   "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.340]   Paul did not say it was a sin to abound
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.300]   or a sin to face plenty.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.660]   He said it takes a certain learning,
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.660]   a certain God-given secret not to sin when you face plenty,
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.500]   not to sin in need.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   And not only that, he said in 1 Timothy 4, verse four,
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.700]   "Everything created by God is good.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.540]   "Nothing is to be rejected
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.500]   "if it is received with thanksgiving,
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.940]   "for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer."
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.940]   In other words, self-denial is not the only way
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.500]   we honor God with the good things of life.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.260]   Thankful enjoyment is another way.
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.220]   1 Timothy 6, 17, he said,
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.860]   "As for the rich in this age,
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.780]   "charge them not to be haughty,
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.600]   "nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.620]   "but on God, who richly provides us
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.540]   "with everything to enjoy.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.780]   "They are to do good."
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.240]   I'm still quoting Paul now.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.560]   "They are to do good, to be rich in good works,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.360]   "to be generous and ready to share."
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.440]   So there is a Christ-exalting self-denial,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.840]   and there is a Christ-exalting enjoyment of God's gifts.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.400]   Number four, don't pursue pain.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.980]   Pursue love, no matter the pain.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.120]   Freely chosen self-denial or unchosen persecution
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.040]   is never an end in itself.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.020]   The aim is love.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.560]   Love bears all things, believes all things,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.320]   hopes all things, endures all things.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.620]   Love does no wrong to a neighbor.
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.360]   Love blesses, love prays, love does good, love serves.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.980]   Therefore, love is a fulfilling of the law.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.980]   Therefore, pursue love, love for people, not pain.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.480]   There will be pain enough.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.220]   And finally, number five,
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:10.380]   yes, God has given most of the developed countries,
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.780]   East and West, a season in these centuries,
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:21.120]   a season of spectacular wealth and leisure
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.820]   and comfort and health and peace and security.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.800]   Why has he done that?
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.960]   What's the meaning of this providence?
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.120]   And I think the answer is in Psalm 67.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.200]   May God be gracious to us and bless us
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.440]   and make his face to shine upon us,
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.280]   that, and here's the answer,
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.680]   that your way may be known on the earth,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.300]   your saving power among all nations.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.260]   The earth has yielded its increase.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.040]   God, our God shall bless us.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.760]   God shall bless us.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.140]   And then he closes the Psalm by telling why.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.920]   Why has he blessed us?
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.620]   Why will he bless us?
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.000]   Let all the ends of the earth fear him.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.280]   God has made America and the West and parts of the East
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.120]   wealthy and healthy and secure
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.400]   so that we would not lay up treasures here on earth,
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.960]   but use our freedom and our wealth and our peace
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.020]   for the sake of reaching the nations
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.920]   with the message of salvation.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.560]   Stand up for this.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.540]   Stand up for this.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.120]   Work for this and you will find enough resistance.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.880]   You'll find it in yourself.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.480]   You'll find it in your church.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.240]   You'll find it in the world
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:59.060]   that you won't have to worry too much anymore
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.240]   that being a Christian is too easy.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.240]   - So good.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.640]   Psalm 67 is such a key text for us at Desiring God,
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.900]   especially verse four, "Let the nations be glad,"
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.160]   which is the title of a book,
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.080]   a book on missions by you, Pastor John.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.200]   Fascinating to hear the text more fully expounded
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.760]   and especially within the abundance context.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.880]   Really interesting.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.280]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.480]   And thanks for joining us today.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.120]   If you want to ask Pastor John,
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.240]   email your question to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.040]   Well, John Piper has preached a couple thousand sermons
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.200]   in front of a few hundred thousand people around the world.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.720]   Only the Lord knows the true count.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.480]   Whatever the exact numbers is a lot of sermons
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.220]   in front of a lot of people.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.000]   And a young preacher wants to know
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.680]   how your preaching has been critiqued over the years,
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.760]   Pastor John.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.040]   He has been critiqued in 10 ways to stand out.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.240]   And we'll walk through those next time.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.400]   10 criticisms of John Piper's preaching.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.560]   I'm your host Tony Reike.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.280]   I'll see you back here on Thursday.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
