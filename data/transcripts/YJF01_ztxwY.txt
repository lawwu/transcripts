[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   The following is a conversation with Richard Wrangham,
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.720]   a biological anthropologist at Harvard,
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.280]   specializing in the study of primates
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.200]   and the evolution of violence, sex, cooking, culture,
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.160]   and other aspects of ape and human behavior
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.340]   at the individual and societal level.
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.960]   He began his career over four decades ago
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.340]   working with Jane Goodall
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.560]   and studying the behavior of chimps,
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.320]   and since then has done a lot of seminal work
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.680]   on human evolution
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.760]   and has proposed several theories
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.360]   for the roles of fire and violence
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.560]   in the evolution of us, hairless apes,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.440]   otherwise known as homo sapiens.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.680]   This is the Lux Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.520]   To support it,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.880]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.960]   And now, here's my conversation with Richard Wrangham.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.080]   You've said that we're much less violent
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.000]   than our close living relatives, the chimps.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Can you elaborate on this point of how violent we are
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.520]   and how violent our evolutionary relatives are?
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.960]   - Well, I haven't said exactly
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.960]   that we're less violent than chimps.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.280]   What I've said is that there are two kinds of violence.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280]   One stems from proactive aggression
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.600]   and the other stems from reactive aggression.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840]   Proactive aggression is planned aggression.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.760]   Reactive aggression is impulsive, defensive.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.560]   It's reactive because it takes place
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.800]   in seconds after the threat.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.840]   And the thing that is really striking about humans
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.760]   compared to our close relatives
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.760]   is the great reduction in the degree of reactive aggression.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.160]   So we are far less violent than chimps
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.680]   when prompted by some relatively minor threat
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.600]   within our own society.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.040]   And the way I judge that is
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.520]   with not super satisfactory data,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.440]   but the study which is particularly striking
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.440]   is one of people living as hunter-gatherers
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.720]   in a really upsetting kind of environment,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.720]   namely people in Australia living in a place
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.160]   where they got a lot of alcohol abuse.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.680]   There's a lot of domestic violence.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.680]   It's all a sort of a society that is
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.520]   as bad from the point of view of violence
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.120]   as an ordinary society can get.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.960]   There's excellent data on the frequency
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.200]   which people actually have physical violence
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.400]   and hit each other.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.640]   And we can compare that to data
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.160]   from several different sites comparing,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.080]   we're looking at chimpanzee and bonobo violence.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.280]   And the difference is between two
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.440]   and three orders of magnitude.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.480]   The frequency with which chimps and bonobos
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.840]   hit each other, chase each other,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.160]   charge each other, physically engage
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.800]   is sometime between 500 and 1,000 times higher
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.380]   than in humans.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.920]   So there's something just amazing about us.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.600]   And this has been recognized for centuries.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.000]   Aristotle drew attention to the fact
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   that we behave in many ways like domesticated animals
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.320]   because we're so unviolent.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   But people say, "Well, what about the hideous engagements
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.880]   "of this 20th century, the First and Second World War
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.640]   "and much else besides?"
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.120]   And that is all proactive violence.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.840]   All of that is gangs of people
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.160]   making deliberate decisions to go off and attack
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.040]   in circumstances which ideally
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.360]   the attackers are going to be able to make their kills
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.320]   and then get out of there.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.920]   In other words, not face confrontation.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.760]   That's the ordinary way that arm is trying to work.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   And there, it turns out that humans and chimpanzees
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.120]   are in a very similar kind of state.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.960]   That is to say, if you look at the rate of death
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.760]   from chimpanzees conducting proactive
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.880]   coalitionary violence, it's very similar in many ways
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.280]   to what you see in humans.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.580]   So we're not downregulated with proactive violence.
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.720]   It's just this reactive violence
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.160]   that is strikingly reduced in humans.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.200]   - So chimpanzees also practice kind of tribal warfare.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.040]   - Indeed they do, yeah.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.960]   So this was discovered first in 1974.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.960]   It was observed first in 1974,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.920]   which was about the time that the first major study
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.160]   of chimpanzees in the wild by Jane Goodall
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.480]   had been going for something like five years
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.240]   during of the chimpanzees being observed
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.280]   wherever they went.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.980]   Until then, they'd been observed at a feeding station
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.040]   where Jane was luring them in to be observed
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.920]   by seeing bananas, which is great.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.320]   She had learned a lot, but she didn't learn
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.880]   what was happening at the edges of their ranges.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.480]   So five years later, it became very obvious
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.640]   that there was hostile relationships between groups.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.560]   And those hostile relationships sometimes take the form
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.600]   of the kind of hostile relationships
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.720]   that you see in many animals,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.000]   which is a bunch of chimps in this case
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.920]   shouting at a bunch of other chimps on their borders.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.520]   But dramatically, in addition to that,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.280]   there is a second kind of interaction.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.280]   And that is when a party of chimpanzees
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.940]   makes a deliberate venture to the edge of their territory
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.240]   silently and then search for members of neighboring groups.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.740]   And what they're searching for is a lone individual.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.220]   So I've been with chimps when they've heard
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.940]   a lone individual under these circumstances
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.920]   or what they think is a lone one,
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.980]   and they touch each other and look at each other
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.080]   and then charge forward, very excited.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.780]   And then while they're charging, all of a sudden,
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.500]   the place where they heard a lone call
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.460]   erupts with a volley of calls.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.820]   It was just one calling out of a larger party.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.460]   And our chimps put on the brakes
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.660]   and scoot back for safety into their own territory.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.620]   But if in fact they do find a lone individual
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.420]   and they can sneak up to them,
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.940]   then they make a deliberate attack.
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.500]   They're hunting, they're stalking and hunting,
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.620]   and then they impose terrible damage,
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.000]   which typically ends in a kill straight away,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   but it might end up with the victim so damaged
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.280]   that they'll crawl away and die a few days or hours later.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.320]   So that was a very dramatic discovery
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   because it really made people realize for the first time
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.840]   that Conrad Lorenz had been wrong when in the 1960s,
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.840]   in his famous book on aggression,
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.760]   he said warfare is restricted to humans,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.040]   animals do not deliberately kill each other.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.120]   Well, now we know that actually there's a bunch of animals
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.400]   that deliberately kill each other,
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.520]   and they always do so under essentially
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.640]   the same circumstances,
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.160]   which is when they feel safe doing it.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.820]   So humans feel safe doing it when they got a weapon.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:52.360]   Animals feel safe when they have a coalition,
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.800]   a coalition that has overwhelming power
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.720]   compared to the victim.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.400]   And so wolves will do that and lions will do that
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.480]   and hyenas will do that and chimpanzees will do it
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.280]   and humans do it too.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.460]   - Can they pull themselves into something
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.580]   that looks more like a symmetric war
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.660]   as opposed to an asymmetric one?
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.300]   So accidentally engaging on the lone individual
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.220]   and getting themselves into trouble?
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.080]   Or are they more aggressive
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.380]   in avoiding these kinds of battles?
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.260]   - No, they're very, very keen to avoid
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.080]   those kinds of battles,
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.620]   but occasionally they can make a mistake.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.300]   But so far there have been no observations
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.780]   of anything like a battle
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.220]   in which both sides maintain themselves.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.260]   And I think you can very confidently say
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.620]   that overwhelmingly what happens is
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.060]   that if they discover that there's several individuals
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.220]   on the other side, then both sides retreat.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.260]   Nobody wants to get hurt.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.020]   What they want to do is to hurt others.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.860]   - Yes.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.460]   So you mentioned Jane Goodall.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.660]   You've worked with her.
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.120]   What was it like working with her?
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.660]   What have you learned from her?
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.660]   - Well, she's a wonderfully independent,
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.020]   courageous person,
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.700]   who she famously began her studies
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.700]   not as a qualified person in terms of education,
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.620]   but qualified only by enthusiasm
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.940]   and considerable experience
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.280]   even in her early 20s with nature.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.060]   So she's courageous in the sense
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.060]   of being able to take on challenges.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.340]   The thing that is very impressive about her
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:39.340]   is her total fidelity to the observations,
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:45.860]   very unwilling to extend beyond the observations,
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.460]   waiting until they mount up
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.560]   and you've really got a confident picture,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.860]   and tremendous attention to individuals.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.400]   So that was an interesting problem from her point of view
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   because when she got to know the chimpanzees of Gombe,
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.060]   this particular community of Kasekela,
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.400]   about 60 individuals.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.700]   So Gombe was in Tanzania on Lake Tanganyika.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.500]   She was there initially with her mother
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.420]   and then alone for two or three years
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.620]   of really intense observation
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.820]   and then slowly joined by other people.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:31.220]   What she discovered was that there were obvious differences
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.540]   in individual personality.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.460]   And the difficulty about that was that
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:42.340]   when she reported this to the larger scientific world,
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.960]   initially her advisors at Cambridge,
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.860]   they said, "Well, we don't know how to handle that
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.140]   because you've got to treat all these animals
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.380]   as the same basically
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.380]   because there is no research tradition
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.220]   of thinking about personalities."
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.720]   Well, now, whatever it is, 60 years later,
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.540]   the study of personalities is a very rich part
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.240]   of the study of animal behavior.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.340]   At any rate, the important point in terms of
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.220]   what was she like is that she stuck to her guns
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.460]   and she absolutely insisted that we have to show,
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.260]   describe in great detail,
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.380]   the differences in personality among these individuals
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.420]   and then you can leave it to the evolutionary biologists
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.660]   to think about what it means.
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.940]   - So what is the process of observation like this
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.220]   like observing the personality
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.540]   but also observing in a way
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.540]   that's not projecting your beliefs about human nature
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.800]   or animal nature onto chimps,
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.540]   which is probably really tempting to project.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.940]   So your understanding of the way the human world works,
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.420]   projecting that onto the chimp world.
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.580]   - Yes, I mean, it's particularly difficult with chimps
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.220]   because chimps are so similar to humans in their behavior
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.740]   that it's very easy to make those projections, as you say.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.860]   The process involves making very clear definitions
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.940]   of what a behavior is.
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.420]   You know, aggression can be defined
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.540]   in terms of a forceful hit, a bite and so on
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.340]   and writing down every time these things happen
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.660]   and then slowly totting up the numbers of times
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.780]   that they happen from individual A
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.740]   towards individuals B, C, D and E
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.620]   so that you build up a very concrete picture
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.780]   rather than interpreting at any point
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.900]   and stopping and saying,
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.480]   "Well, they seem to be rather aggressive."
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.800]   So the sort of formal system
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.500]   is that you build up a pattern of the relationships
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.380]   based on a description
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.500]   of the different types of interactions,
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.940]   the aggressive and the friendly interactions
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.980]   and all of these are defined in concrete
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:12.300]   and so from that, you extract a pattern of relationships
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.340]   and the relationships can be defined as
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.340]   relatively friendly, relatively aggressive, competitive
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:27.460]   based on the frequency of these types of interactions
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.020]   and so one can talk in terms of individuals
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.060]   having a relationship which on the scores of friendliness
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.180]   is two standard deviations outside the mean.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.020]   I mean, you know, it's--
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.420]   - In which direction, sorry?
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.660]   Both directions?
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.020]   - Well, I mean, you know, there will be obviously
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.660]   the friendly ones will be the ones
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.060]   who have exceptionally high rates
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.460]   of spending time close to each other,
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.580]   of touching each other in a gentle way,
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.100]   of grooming each other
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.060]   and by the way, finding that those things
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.380]   are correlated with each other.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.940]   So it's possible to define a friendship
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.140]   with a capital F in a very systematic way
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.760]   and to compare that between individuals
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.780]   but also between communities of chimpanzees
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.060]   and between different species
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.420]   so that, you know, we can say that in some species,
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.860]   individuals have friends and others that don't at all.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.660]   - What about just because there's different personalities
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.900]   and because they're so fascinating,
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.620]   what about sort of falling in love
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.220]   or forming friendships with chimps, you know?
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.220]   Like really, you know, connecting with them as an observer.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.320]   What role does that play?
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.960]   'Cause you're tracking these individuals
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.760]   that are full of life and intelligence
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.540]   for long periods of time.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.120]   Plus, as a human, especially in those days for Jane,
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.280]   she's alone observing it.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.080]   It gets lonely as a human.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.000]   I mean, probably deeply lonely as a human being
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.720]   observe these other intelligent species.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.840]   - It's a very reasonable question
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.560]   and of course, Jane in those early years,
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.260]   I think she's willing now to talk about the fact
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.820]   that she regrets to some extent how close she became.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.620]   And the problem is not just from the humans,
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.460]   the problem is from the chimpanzees as well
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.460]   because they do things that are extremely affectionate,
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.660]   if you like.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.660]   You know, at one point, Jane offered a ripe fruit
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.260]   to a chimpanzee called David Greybeard.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.320]   David Greybeard took it and squeezed her hand
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.800]   as if to say thank you.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.160]   And then I think he gave it back, if I remember rightly.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.000]   - Yeah.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.500]   (laughing)
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.020]   No thank you.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:55.860]   - Right.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.400]   - Oh, it's almost like thank you
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.560]   and returning the affection by giving the fruit.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.400]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.220]   - If they did something like that.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.000]   - Yeah, no, it was a gentle squeeze.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.120]   I mean, chimpanzees could squeeze you very hard
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.220]   as occasionally has happened.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.460]   Some chimps are aggressive to people
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.400]   and others are friendly.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.940]   And the ones that are friendly
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.240]   tend to be rather sympathetic characters
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.160]   because they might be ones who are having problems
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.120]   in their own society.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.400]   You know, so Jomio in Gombe used to come
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.700]   and sit next to me quite often.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.800]   And he was having a hard time making it in that society,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.820]   which I can describe to you
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.000]   in terms of the number of aggressive interactions
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:39.840]   if you want, you know,
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.280]   but just to be informed about it.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   So all of this is a temptation to be very firmly resisted.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.240]   And in the community that I've been working with in Uganda
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.320]   for the last 30 years,
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.040]   we try extremely hard to impress
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.360]   on all of the research students who come with us
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.080]   that it is absolutely vital
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.720]   that you do not fall into that temptation.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.840]   Now, you know, we heard a story of one person
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.300]   who did reach out and touch one of our chimps.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.160]   It's a very, very bad idea.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.060]   Not because the chimp is going to
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.100]   do anything violent at the time,
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.120]   but because if they learn
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.020]   that humans are as weak physically as we are
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.000]   compared to them,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.740]   then they can take advantage of it, us.
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.740]   And that's what happened in Gombe.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.300]   So after Jane had done the, you know,
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.780]   very obvious thing when you're first engaged in this game
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.540]   of allowing the infants to approach her
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.780]   and then tickling them and playing with them,
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:49.140]   some of those infants had the personality
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.300]   of wanting to take advantage of that knowledge later.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.020]   And so, you know, you had an individual, Frodo,
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.220]   who was violent on a regular basis
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.700]   towards humans when he was an adult,
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.620]   and he was quite dangerous.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.900]   I mean, he could easily have killed someone.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.060]   In fact, he did kill one person.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.700]   He killed a baby that he took from a mother,
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.980]   a human baby that he took off her hip
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.820]   when he met her on the path.
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.300]   So, you know, it's a reminder that we're dealing with
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.500]   a species that are rather human-like
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.460]   in the range of emotions they have,
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.360]   in the capacities they have,
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.940]   and even in the strength they have,
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.100]   they are in many ways stronger than humans.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.140]   So it's, you've got to be careful.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.980]   - So in the full range of friendliness and violence,
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.220]   the capacity for these very human things.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.340]   - Yes, I mean, it's very obvious with violence,
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.220]   as we talked about, you know, that they will kill.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.080]   They will kill not just strangers.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.660]   They can kill other adults within their own group.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.660]   They can kill babies that are strangers.
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.220]   They can kill babies in their own group.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.420]   So, you know, this is a long-lived individual.
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.660]   Obviously, these killings can't have very often,
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.500]   because otherwise they'd all be dead.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.020]   And we're now finding that they can live
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.220]   to 50 or 60 years in the wild
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.220]   at relatively low population density,
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.340]   'cause they're big animals,
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.480]   eating a rather specialized kind of food, the ripe fruits.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.940]   So it doesn't happen all the time.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.820]   With friendliness, they are very strong
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:28.820]   to support each other.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.820]   They very much depend on their close friendships,
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.940]   which they express through physical contact,
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.640]   and particularly through grooming.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.140]   So grooming occurs when one individual approaches another.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.820]   I might present for grooming, a very common way of starting,
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.180]   turning their back or presenting an arm
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.020]   or something like that,
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.980]   and the other just riffles their fingers through the hair.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.500]   And that's partly just soothing,
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.380]   and it's partly looking for parasites.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.420]   But mostly it's just soothing.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:11.420]   And the point about this is it can go on for half an hour.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.460]   It can go on for sometimes even an hour.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:20.040]   So this is a major expression of interest in somebody else.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.700]   - When did your interest in this one particular aspects
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.940]   of chimp come to be, which is violence?
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.280]   When did the study of violence in chimps
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.540]   become something you're deeply interested in?
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:40.800]   - Well, for my PhD in the early 1970s,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.060]   I was in Gombe with Jane Goodall
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.200]   and was studying feeding behavior.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.060]   But during that time, we were seeing,
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.420]   and I say we because there were half a dozen
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.840]   research students all in her camp.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:01.220]   We were discovering that chimps
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.060]   had this capacity for violence.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.480]   The first kill happened during that time,
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.020]   which was of an infant in a neighboring group.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:15.240]   And we were starting to see these hunting expeditions.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.840]   And this was the start of my interest
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.780]   because it was such chilling evidence
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.780]   of an extraordinary similarity between chimps and humans.
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:32.340]   Now, at that time, we didn't know very much
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.120]   about how chimpanzees and humans were related.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.060]   Chimps, gorillas, bonobos are all three big black hairy
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.660]   things that live in the African forests
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:48.660]   and eat fruits and leaves when they can't find fruits.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.240]   And walk on their knuckles.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.800]   And they all look rather similar to each other.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.840]   So they seem as though those three species,
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.720]   chimps and gorillas and bonobos,
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.400]   should all be each other's closest relatives.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.520]   And humans are something rather separate.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.660]   And so any of them would be of interest to us.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.520]   Subsequently, we learn that actually that's not true.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.440]   And that there's a special relationship
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.400]   between humans and chimpanzees.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.920]   But at the time, even without knowing that,
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.440]   it was obvious that there was something very odd
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.760]   about chimpanzees because Jane had discovered
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.360]   they were making tools.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.020]   She had seen that they were hunting meat.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.720]   She had seen that they were sharing the meat
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.160]   among each other.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.440]   She had seen that the societies were dominated politically
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.600]   by males, coalitions of males.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.760]   All of these things, of course,
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.220]   resonate so closely with humans.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.400]   And then it turns out that in contrast
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.040]   to conventional wisdom at the time,
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.760]   the chimpanzees were capable of hunting and killing
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.260]   members of neighboring groups.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:00.360]   Well, at that point, the similarities
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.600]   between chimps and humans become less a matter
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.160]   of sort of sheer intellectual fascination
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.480]   than something that has a really deep meaning
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.560]   about our understanding of ourselves.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.680]   I mean, until then, you can cheerfully think of humans
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.800]   as a species apart from the rest of nature
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.760]   because we are so peculiar.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.440]   But when it turns out that, as it turns out,
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.040]   one of our two closest relatives
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.800]   has got these features that we share
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.660]   and that one of the features is something
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.080]   that is the most horrendous,
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.560]   as well as fascinating, aspect of human behavior,
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.060]   then how can you resist just trying
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.960]   to find out what's going on?
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.600]   - So I have to say this.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.440]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with the man,
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.320]   but fans of this podcast are.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.480]   So we're talking about chimps,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.940]   we're talking about violence.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.300]   My now friend, Mr. Joe Rogan, is a big fan of those things.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.120]   I'm a big fan of these topics.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.120]   I think a lot of people are fascinated by these topics.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.120]   So as you're saying, why do we find the exploration
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.880]   of violence and the relations between chimps so interesting?
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.940]   What can they teach us about ourselves?
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:29.800]   - Until we had this information about chimpanzees,
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   it was possible to believe that the psychology
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.520]   behind warfare was totally the result
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:48.600]   of some kind of recent cultural innovation.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.420]   It had nothing to do with our biology.
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.240]   Or if you like, that it's got something to do
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   with sin and God and the devil and that sort of thing.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.680]   But what the chimps tell us,
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.140]   after we think carefully about it,
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.680]   is that it seems undoubtedly the case
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   that our evolutionary psychology has given us
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:22.680]   the same kind of attitude towards violence
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.400]   as occurred in chimpanzees.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.360]   And in both species, it has evolved
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.080]   because of its evolutionary significance.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.600]   In other words, because it's been helpful
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.880]   to the individuals who have practiced it.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.880]   And now we know that, as I mentioned,
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.120]   other species do this as well.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:49.120]   In fact, wolves, which this is a really
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.160]   kind of ironical observation.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.840]   Conrad Lorenz, who I mentioned, had been the person
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.220]   who thought that human aggression in the form
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.000]   of killing members of our own species
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.080]   was unique to our species.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.600]   He was a great fan of wolves.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.020]   He studied wolves.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.920]   And in captivity, he noted that wolves
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   are very unlikely to harm each other in spats
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.440]   among members of the same group.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.160]   What happens is that one of them will roll over
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.640]   and present their neck, much as you see
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.760]   in a dog park nowadays, and the other might put
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.800]   their jaws on the neck but will not bite.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.300]   Okay, so now it turns out that if you study wolves
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:35.260]   in the wild, then neighboring packs often go hunting
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.320]   for each other, they are in fierce competition,
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.700]   and as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.540]   is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.380]   - Wow.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.240]   - So it's a really serious business.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.500]   The chimpanzees and humans fit into a larger pattern
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.280]   of understanding animals in which you don't have
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.060]   an instinct for violence.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.140]   What you have is an instinct, if you like,
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.800]   to use violence adaptively.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.700]   And if the right circumstances come up, it'll be adaptive.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.740]   If the right circumstances don't come up, it won't be.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.380]   So some chimpanzee communities are much more violent
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.180]   than others because of things like the frequency
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.800]   with which a large party of males is likely
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.880]   to meet a lone victim, and that's gonna depend
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.480]   on the local ecology.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.700]   But, you know, so the overall answer to the question
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.300]   of what do chimps teach us is that we have to take
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.320]   very seriously the notion that in humans,
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.980]   the tendency to make war is a consequence
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.380]   of a long-term evolutionary adaptation
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.420]   and not just a military ideology or some sort
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.320]   of local patriarchal phenomenon.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.040]   And of course, a reading of history,
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.120]   a judicious reading of history fits that very easily
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.820]   because war is so commonplace.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.720]   - It's not an accident.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.560]   So it's not a construction of human civilization.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.520]   It's deeply within us, violence.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.420]   So what's the difference between violence
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.000]   on the individual level versus group?
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.880]   It seems like with chimps and with wolves,
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.380]   there's something about the dynamic of multiple chimps
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.280]   together that increase the chance of violence.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.000]   Or is violence still fundamentally part of the individual?
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Like would an individual be as violent
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.960]   as they might be as part of a group?
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.240]   - If we're talking about killing,
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   then violence in the sense of killing
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.000]   is very much associated with a group.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.920]   And the reason is that individuals don't benefit
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.620]   by getting into a fight in which they risk
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.660]   being hurt themselves.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.640]   So it's only when you have overwhelming power
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.760]   that the temptation to try and kill another victim
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.640]   rises sufficiently for them to be motivated to do it.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:27.840]   The average number of chimpanzee males
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.840]   that attack a single male in something like 50 observations
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.000]   that have accumulated in the last 50 years
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   from various different study sites is eight, eight to one.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.800]   Now, sometimes it can go as low as three to one,
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.440]   but that's getting risky.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.640]   But if you have eight, you can see what can happen.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.880]   I mean, basically you have one male on one foot,
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.080]   another male on another foot, another male on an arm,
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.640]   another male on another arm.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.480]   Now you have an immobilized victim
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:06.320]   with four individuals capable of just doing the damage.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.680]   And so they can then move in and tear out his thorax
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.440]   and tear off his testicles and twist an arm
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.520]   until it breaks and do this appalling damage
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.720]   with no weapons.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:21.880]   - What is the way in which they prefer
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.640]   to commit the violence?
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.800]   Is there something to be said about the actual process of it?
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.360]   Is there an artistry to it?
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.360]   So if you look at human warfare,
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.160]   there's different parts in history
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.800]   prefer different kind of approaches to violence.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.240]   It had more to do with tools, I think, on the human side.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.760]   But just the nature of violence itself,
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.520]   sorry, the practice, the strategy of violence,
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.080]   is it basically the same?
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.440]   You improvise, you immobilize the victim,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.960]   and they just rip off different parts
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.760]   of their body kind of thing?
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.200]   - Yeah, you have to understand
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.640]   that these things are happening at high speed
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.120]   in thick vegetation, mostly,
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.040]   so that they have not been filmed carefully.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.680]   We have a few little glimpses of them
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.760]   from one or two people like David Watts,
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.920]   who's got some great video,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.320]   but we don't know enough to be able to say that.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.880]   It's hard for me to imagine that there are styles
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:28.440]   that vary between communities, cultural styles,
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.520]   but it is possible.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.920]   And one thing that is striking is that
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.120]   the number of times that an individual victim
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.320]   has been killed immediately has been higher
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.160]   in Kibale Forest in Uganda
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.600]   than in Gombe National Park in Tanzania.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.160]   It's conceivable, that's just chance.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.320]   We don't have real numbers now, but what is this?
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.380]   I can't remember the exact numbers,
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.180]   but 10 versus 15 or something.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:05.120]   So maybe they damage to the point of expecting a death
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.120]   in one place and they just finish it off in the other,
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.060]   but most likely that sort of difference
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:17.060]   will be due to differences in the numbers of attackers.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.880]   - You know, human beings are able to conceive
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.360]   of the philosophical notion of death, of mortality.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.480]   Is there any of that for chimps
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.460]   when they're thinking about violence?
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.500]   Is violence, like what is the nature
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.520]   of their conception of violence, do you think?
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.460]   Do they realize they're taking
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.600]   another conscious being's life,
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.940]   or is it some kind of like optimization
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.500]   over the use of resources or something like that?
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:53.320]   - I don't think it's, I can't think of any way
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.140]   to get an answer to the question
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.720]   of what they know about that.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:03.100]   I think that the way to think about the motivation
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.280]   is rather like the motivation in sex.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:14.600]   So when males are interested in having sex with a female,
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.020]   whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans,
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:21.320]   they don't think about the fact that what this is going
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:25.260]   to do is to lead to a baby, mostly.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.100]   - You're right.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.600]   - Mostly what they're thinking about is,
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.860]   I want to get my end away.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.480]   And I think that it's a similar kind of process
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.760]   with the chimps.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.680]   What they are thinking about is,
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   I want to kill this individual.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.580]   And it's hard to imagine that taking
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.600]   the other individual's perspective
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.200]   and thinking about what it means for them to die
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.760]   is going to be an important part of that.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   In fact, there's reasons to think
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.120]   it should not be an important part of it,
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.100]   'cause it might inhibit them,
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.960]   and they don't want to be inhibited.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.680]   The more efficient they are in doing this, the better.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.240]   But I think it's interesting to think
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.720]   about this whole motivational question,
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.720]   because it does produce the sort of rather haunting thought
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.400]   that there has been selection in favor
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.540]   of enthusiasm about killing.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:22.020]   And in our relatively gentle
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:26.560]   and deliberately moral society that we have today,
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.000]   it's very difficult for us to face the thought
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   that in all of us, there might've been a residue
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:42.240]   and more than that, sort of an active potential
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.580]   for that thought of really enjoying killing someone else.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:52.640]   But I think one can sustain that thought fairly obviously
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.760]   by thinking of circumstances
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.920]   in which it would be true
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:02.960]   that the ordinary human male would be delighted
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.640]   to be part of a group that was killing someone.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.400]   What you've got to do is to be in a position
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.560]   where you're regarding the victim
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.400]   as dangerous and thoroughly hostile.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.040]   - But the pure enjoyment of violence,
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.920]   there's, I don't know if you know this historian,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.960]   Dan Carlin, he has a podcast.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.960]   He has an episode, three, four hour episode
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.920]   that I recommend to others, it's quite haunting.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.340]   But he takes us through an entire history,
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.760]   it's called "Painful Tainment."
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.760]   The history of humans enjoying the murder of others
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.880]   in a large group.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.800]   So like public executions were part of,
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.600]   long part of human history.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.040]   And there's something that,
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.300]   for some reason humans seem to have been drawn
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.360]   to just watching others die.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.800]   And he ventures to say that that may still be part of us.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.400]   For example, he said if it was possible to televise,
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.320]   to stream online, for example,
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.960]   the execution and the murder of somebody,
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.000]   or even the torture of somebody,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   that a very large fraction of the population on earth
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.000]   would not be able to look away.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.760]   They'd be drawn to that somehow.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.720]   As a very dark thought that we were drawn to that.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.000]   So you think that's part of us in there somewhere,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   that selection that we evolved for the enjoyment of killing
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.320]   and the enjoyment of observing those in our tribe
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.440]   doing the killing.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.160]   - Yes, I mean, and that word you produced at the end
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.720]   is critical, I think.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.480]   Because it would be a little bit weird, I think,
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.760]   to imagine a lot of enjoyment
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.720]   about people in your own tribe being killed.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.640]   - Right.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.200]   - I don't think we're interested in violence
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.440]   for violence's sake that much.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:14.840]   It's when you get these social boundaries set up.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.420]   And in today's world, happily,
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.020]   we kind of are already one world.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:29.200]   You have to dehumanize someone to get to the point
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   where they are really outside our recognition of a tribe
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.400]   at some level, which is the whole human species.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.120]   But in ancient times, that would not have been true.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.640]   Because in ancient times,
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:47.280]   there are lots of accounts of hunters and gatherers
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.400]   in which the appearance of a stranger
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:56.920]   would lead to an immediate response of shooting on sight.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.600]   Because what was human was the people
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.240]   that were in your society.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.120]   And the other things that actually looked like us
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.720]   and were human in that sense, were not regarded as human.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.640]   So there was a kind of automatic dehumanization
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.160]   of everybody that didn't speak our language
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.640]   or hadn't already somehow become recognized
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.240]   as sufficiently like us to escape
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.760]   the dehumanization content.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.960]   - And so hopefully the story of human history
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   is that we are, that tribalism fades away.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.120]   That our dehumanization, the natural desire to dehumanize
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.280]   or a tendency to dehumanize groups
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.800]   that are not within this tribe decreases over time.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.760]   And so then the desire for violence decreases over time.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.520]   - Yeah, I mean, that's the optimistic perspective.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.240]   And the great sort of concern of course,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.360]   is that small conflicts can build up into bigger conflicts
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.560]   and then dehumanization happens and then violence is released
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.080]   as Hannah Arendt says.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   You know, there currently is no known alternative to war
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.320]   as a means of settling really important conflicts.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.720]   - So if we look at the big picture,
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.960]   what role has violence or do you think violence
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.960]   has played in the evolution of Homo sapiens?
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.960]   So we are quite an intelligent,
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.400]   got a beautiful particular little branch
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.900]   on the evolutionary tree.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:39.040]   What part of that was played by our tendency to be violent?
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.920]   - Well, I think that violence was responsible
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.160]   for creating your Homo sapiens.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:54.280]   And that raises the question of what Homo sapiens is.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.040]   - Yes.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.280]   (laughs)
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   - So, you know, nowadays people begin the sort of concept
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:10.840]   of what Homo sapiens is by thinking about features
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.400]   that are very obviously different
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.760]   from all of the other species of Homo.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:20.720]   And our large brain, our very rounded cranium,
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.280]   our relatively small face, these are characteristics
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.760]   which are developed in a relatively modern way
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.480]   by about 170,000 years ago, say.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.020]   You know, it's one of the earliest skulls in Africa
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.600]   that really captures that.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   But it has been argued that that is a,
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   an episode in a process that has been started
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   substantially earlier.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.280]   And there's no doubt that that's true.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.160]   Homo sapiens is a species that has been changing
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:41:00.160]   pretty continuously throughout the length of time it's there.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.440]   And it goes back to 300,000 years ago,
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:08.440]   315, literally, is the time, the best estimate of a date
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.000]   for a series of bones from Morocco
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.960]   that have been dated three or four years ago at that time
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.480]   and have been characterized as earliest Homo sapiens.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   Now at that point, they are only beginning the trend
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.840]   of sapienization.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   And that trend consists basically of gracilization,
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.720]   of making our ancestors less robust,
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.720]   shorter faces, smaller teeth, smaller brow ridge,
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:45.480]   narrower face, thinner cranium,
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.480]   all these things that are associated with reduced violence.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.280]   Okay, so that's saying what,
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.160]   that's Homo sapiens beginning.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.600]   So it began sometime 300,000 to 400,000 years ago,
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.600]   because by 315,000 years ago,
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.360]   you've already got something recognizable.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.200]   - So you're more on that side of things,
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.720]   that those are this gradual process.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.200]   It's not 150, 170,000 years ago.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:14.200]   It started like 400,000 years ago, and it's just--
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.360]   - It started three to 400,000 years ago.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.920]   And if you look at 170, it's got even more like us.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.520]   And if you look at 100, it's got more like us again.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.360]   And if you look at 50, it's more like us again.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.280]   It's all the way.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.080]   It's just getting more and more like the moderns.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.760]   So the question is, what happened
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.560]   between 300,000 and 400,000 years ago
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.640]   to produce Homo sapiens?
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.040]   And I think we have a pretty good answer now.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.080]   And the answer comes from violence.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:44.040]   And the story begins by focusing on this question.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:49.040]   Why is it that in the human species,
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.480]   we are unique among all primates
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.600]   in not having an alpha male in any group,
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.560]   in the sense that what we don't have
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.800]   is an alpha male who personally beats up every other male?
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   And the answer that has been portrayed most richly
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:18.600]   by Christopher Bohm and whose work I've elaborated on
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:23.720]   is that only in humans do you have a system
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:28.560]   by which any male who tries to bully others
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:33.200]   and become the alpha equivalent to an alpha gorilla
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.240]   or an alpha chimpanzee or an alpha bonobo
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.520]   or an alpha baboon or anything like that,
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.560]   any male who tries to do that in humans
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:44.460]   gets taken down by a coalition of beta males.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:47.880]   That coalition.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.280]   - Yes.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.120]   That's a really good picture of human society, yes.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:52.960]   I like it.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.800]   - Okay.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.600]   So and that's the way all our societies work now.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.480]   - Yes.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.640]   - Because individuals try and be alpha
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.000]   and then they get taken out.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   - Yeah, I mean, we don't usually think of ourselves
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.440]   as beta males, but yes, I suppose that's what democracy is.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.280]   - Exactly.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.100]   - Yes.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:08.940]   - Exactly.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:14.560]   Okay, so at some point, alpha males get taken out.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.760]   Well, what alpha males are are males who respond
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.520]   with high reactive violence to any challenge
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.680]   to their status.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.040]   You see it all the time in primates.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.000]   Some beta male thinks he's getting strong
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.640]   and maturing in wisdom and so on,
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.840]   and he refuses to kowtow to the alpha male.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.320]   And the alpha male comes straight in and charges at him.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.120]   Or maybe he'll just wait for a few minutes
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.320]   and then take an opportunity to attack him.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:51.280]   All of these primates have got a high tendency
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.200]   for reactive aggression.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.400]   And that enables the possibility of alpha males.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.240]   We don't.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.400]   We have this great reduction, as I talked about earlier.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.120]   And the question is, when did that reduction happen?
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.520]   Well, cut to the famous experiments
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.280]   by the Russian biologist Dmitry Belyaev,
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.260]   who tried domesticating wild animals.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.880]   When you domesticate wild animals,
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.720]   what you're doing is reducing reactive aggression.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.200]   You are selecting those individuals to breed
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.960]   who are most willing to be approached by a human
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.360]   or by another member of their own species
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:39.360]   and are least likely to erupt in a reactive aggression.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.920]   And you only have to do that for a few generations
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:47.080]   to discover that there are changes in the skull.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.720]   And those changes consist of
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:55.640]   shorter face, smaller teeth,
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.320]   reduced maleness,
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.840]   the males become increasingly female-like,
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.900]   and reduced brain size.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.400]   Well, the changes that are characteristic
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.400]   of domesticated animals in general
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.880]   compared to wild animals are all found in homo sapiens
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.660]   compared to our early ancestors.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.420]   So it's a very strong signal
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.040]   that when we first see homo sapiens,
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.200]   what we're seeing is evidence of a reduction
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.240]   in reactive aggression.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.360]   And that suggests that what's happening with homo sapiens
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.080]   is that that is the point
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.480]   at which there is selection against the alpha males.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.320]   And therefore, the way in which the selection happened
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.480]   would have been the way it happens today.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.920]   The beta males take them out.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.480]   So I think that homo sapiens is a species
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   characterized by the suppression of reactive aggression,
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.360]   as a kind of incidental consequence,
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.480]   of the suppression of the alpha male.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.760]   And the story of our species
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.040]   is the story of how the beta males took charge
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.880]   and have been responsible
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.980]   for the generation of a new kind of human,
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:15.020]   and incidentally,
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:21.120]   for imposing on the society
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.200]   a new set of values.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.720]   Because when those beta males discovered
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.880]   that they could take out the previous alpha male
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.000]   and continue to do so,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.200]   'cause in every generation,
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.520]   there'll always be some male who says,
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.200]   "Oh, well, maybe I'll become the alpha male."
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.260]   So they just keep chopping them down.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.400]   In discovering that, they also obviously discovered
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.500]   that they could kill anybody in the group.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.480]   Females, young males,
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:52.020]   anybody who didn't follow their values.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   And so this story is one in which the males of our species,
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:01.460]   and these would be the breeding males,
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:06.760]   have been able to impose their values on everybody else.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.080]   And there is two kinds of values.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.640]   There's one kind of value is things
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   that are good for the group,
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.380]   like thou shalt not murder.
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.200]   And the other kind of value
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.100]   is things that are good for the males,
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.200]   such as, hey, guess what?
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.440]   When good food comes in, males get it first.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.280]   - Yes.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.480]   I mean, it's fascinating that that kind of set of ideals
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.920]   could out-compete the others.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.360]   Do you have a sense of why,
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.440]   or maybe you can comment on Neanderthals
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.200]   and all the other early humans,
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   why did Homo sapiens come to succeed and flourish
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.680]   and all the other ones,
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.080]   all the other branches of evolution died out?
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.720]   Or got murdered out.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.000]   - Nowadays, when Homo sapiens meets Homo sapiens,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.160]   and we don't know each other initially,
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.600]   then conflict breaks out
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   and the more militarily able group wins.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.080]   You know, we've seen that everywhere
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.220]   throughout the age of exploration and throughout history.
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.960]   So I'm rather surprised.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.000]   You know, the conventional wisdom
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.120]   that you see nowadays in contemporary anthropology
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:28.120]   is very reluctant to point to success in warfare
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:32.400]   as the reason why sapiens wiped out Neanderthals
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.480]   within about 3,000 years of the sapiens
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.640]   coming into Europe 43,000 years ago.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.200]   And people are much more inclined to say,
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.160]   well, the Neanderthals were at low population density,
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:50.160]   so they just couldn't survive the demographic sort of sweep.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.880]   Or the disease came in,
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.520]   and maybe those things might've been important.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.960]   But far and away, the most obvious possibility
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:03.440]   is that sapiens were just,
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.680]   were powerful.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.300]   They had, everyone agrees they had larger groups.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.560]   They had better weapons.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.840]   They had projectile weapons, bows and arrows,
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.200]   to judge from the little microlith bits of flake,
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.520]   which the Neanderthals didn't.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:29.000]   You know, nowadays there's evidence of interbreeding,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.360]   quite extensive interbreeding
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.080]   between sapiens and Neanderthals,
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.120]   as well as with some other groups.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.240]   And sometimes people say, well, you know,
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.520]   so they loved each other.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.400]   They made love, not war.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.760]   I think they made love and war.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.480]   And, you know, it wouldn't necessarily have been too loving.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.220]   I mean, if you just follow through
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.680]   from typical ethnographies nowadays
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:55.380]   of when dominant groups meet subordinate groups,
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.840]   they didn't know each other,
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.520]   then you can imagine that Neanderthal females
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.400]   would essentially be captured
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.360]   and taken into sapiens groups.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:12.080]   - Maybe you can comment on this cautiously and eloquently.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:18.200]   What's the role of sexual violence in human evolution?
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.480]   'Cause you mentioned taking Neanderthal females.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.920]   You've also mentioned that some of these rules
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:28.760]   are defined by the male side of the society.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.600]   What's the role of sexual violence in this story?
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.120]   - I think you've got to distinguish
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.840]   between groups and within groups.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:41.680]   And, you know, I think the world has been slowly waking up
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.000]   over the last several decades
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   to the fact that sexual violence is routine in war.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.640]   And that to me says that it's just another example
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:01.360]   of power corrupts because, you know,
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:06.360]   when frustrated, scared, elated soldiers
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:12.800]   come upon females in a group
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.360]   that there's been essential dehumanization of,
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.560]   then they get carried away by opportunity.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:25.120]   It is not always possible to argue
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:28.560]   that this is adaptive nowadays
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.160]   because, you know, you get lots and lots of stories
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:36.160]   of women being abused to the point of being killed.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:41.200]   She'll be gang raped and then killed.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:46.200]   There's lots of terrible cases of that reported
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.840]   from all sorts of different wars.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:54.560]   But you can see that that could build on a pattern
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.400]   that would have been adaptive
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:01.560]   if happening under sort of much less extreme circumstances.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:05.200]   The war is very extreme nowadays
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.480]   in the sense that you get battles
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:11.280]   in which people are sent by a military hierarchy
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.160]   into a war situation in which they do not feel
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.480]   what hunters and gatherers would typically have felt,
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.640]   which would have been that if we attack,
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.960]   we have an excellent chance of getting away with it.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:25.240]   Nowadays, you know, you're sent in across the Somme
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.800]   or whatever it is, and there's a very high chance
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.320]   you will be killed, and that's totally unnatural
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.080]   and a novel evolutionary experience, I think.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:37.160]   Then there's sexual coercion within groups.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:42.140]   So that takes various kinds of forms.
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.720]   But nowadays, of course,
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.960]   I think people recognize increasingly
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   that the principal form of sexual intimidation and rape
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.100]   occurs within relationships.
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.840]   It's not stranger rape
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.440]   that is really statistically important.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:08.440]   It is much more what happens behind the walls
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:14.240]   of a bedroom where people have been living for some time.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:19.920]   And just two sort of thoughts and observations about this.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.440]   One is that it may seem odd
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:32.840]   that males should think it a good idea, as it were,
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:38.320]   to impose themselves sexually on someone
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.180]   with whom they have a relationship.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:46.000]   But what they're doing is intimidating someone
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.380]   in a relationship in which the relative power
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.840]   in the relationship has continuing significance
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.360]   for a long time.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:58.840]   And that power probably goes well beyond just the sexual.
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.920]   You know, it's to do with domestic relationships,
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.200]   it's to do with the man getting his own way all the way.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:09.840]   - It's power dynamics, and the sexual aggression
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.240]   is one of the tools to regain power, gain power,
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.920]   gain more power, and that kind of thing.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.340]   And in that respect, it's worth noting
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:25.700]   that although this wasn't appreciated for some time,
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.340]   it's emerging that in a bunch of primates,
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:32.620]   you have somewhat similar, somewhat parallel kinds
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:35.020]   of sexual intimidation,
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:37.840]   where males will target particular females,
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.320]   even in a group in which the norm is for females
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.520]   to mate with multiple males.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.980]   But each male will target a particular female
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.580]   and the more he is aggressive towards her,
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:53.220]   then the more she conforms to his wishes
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.260]   when he wants to mate.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.960]   So a long-term pattern of sexual intimidation.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.340]   So there's that aspect.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:02.700]   The other aspect I would just note is that
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:08.980]   males get away with a lot compared to females
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:13.660]   in any kind of intersexual conflict.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:19.920]   You know, so the punishment, here's one example of this,
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.460]   the punishment for a husband killing a wife
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.620]   has always been much less than the punishment
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.120]   for a wife killing a husband.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:32.180]   And you see similar sorts of things
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:37.180]   in terms of the punishments for adultery and so on.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:42.980]   I bring this up in the context of males
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:46.780]   sexually intimidating their partners,
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:49.160]   be it wives or whoever,
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:54.360]   because it's a reminder that it's basically
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.780]   a patriarchal world that we have come from.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:02.060]   A patriarchal world in which male alliances
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:06.260]   tend to support males and take advantage of the fact
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:09.760]   that they have political power at the expense of females.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.980]   And I would say that that all goes back
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.780]   to what happened three to 400,000 years ago,
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.660]   when the beta males took charge
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:19.160]   and they started imposing their own norms
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:22.500]   on society as a whole, and they've continued to do so.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.820]   And we now look at ourselves and, you know,
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.780]   Jordan Peterson says, "We are not a patriarchal society."
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:31.100]   Well, you know, it's true that the laws
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.780]   try and make it even-handed nowadays
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.420]   between males and females,
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.820]   but obviously we are patriarchal de facto,
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:43.580]   because society still in many ways supports men
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:48.020]   better than it supports women in these sorts of conflicts.
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:51.860]   - So beta male patriarchal. (laughs)
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:55.300]   If we were looking at the evolutionary history.
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:58.860]   Okay, is there, maybe sticking on Jordan for a second,
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:03.860]   is there, so he's a psychologist, right?
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:09.420]   And what part of the picture do you think he's missing
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:14.780]   in analyzing the human relations?
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:20.140]   Like what does he need to understand
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.380]   about our origins in violence
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:24.940]   and the way that society has been constructed?
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.540]   - Oh, I don't want to go deep
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:30.340]   into his missing perspectives, you know,
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:34.540]   but I just think that what he's doing
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.900]   in that particular example
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:40.180]   is focusing on the legalistic position.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:44.020]   And that's great that, you know,
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:48.180]   you do not find formal patriarchy in the law,
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:49.740]   anything like to the extent
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:53.620]   that you could find it a hundred years ago and so on.
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.060]   You know, women have got the vote now, hooray,
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.660]   but it took a long time for women to get the vote.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:02.260]   And it remains the case
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:07.260]   that the women suffer in various kinds of ways.
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:13.540]   You know, I mean, a woman who has lots of sexual partners
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:17.940]   is treated much more rudely
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:21.220]   than a male who has lots of sexual partners.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:23.100]   There are all sorts of informal ways
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:27.180]   in which it's rougher being a woman than it is a man.
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:32.180]   - And if we look at the surface layer of the law,
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.260]   we may miss the deeper human nature,
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:41.180]   like the origins of our human nature that still operates
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.620]   no matter what the law says.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:47.140]   - Yeah, which is, you know, human nature is awkward
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:50.980]   because it includes some unpleasant features
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:54.180]   that when we sit back and reflect about them,
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:57.900]   we would like them to go away.
[00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:02.900]   But it remains the fact that men are hugely concerned
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:09.420]   to try and have sex with at least one woman,
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:14.060]   and you know, often lots of women.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.260]   And so men are constantly putting pressure on women
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.860]   in ways that women find unpleasant.
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:21.660]   And if men sit back and reflect about it,
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.900]   they think, "Yeah, we shouldn't do this."
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:26.260]   But actually it just goes on because of human nature.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:30.940]   - So maybe looking at particular humans in history,
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.860]   let's talk about Genghis Khan.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:37.220]   So is this particular human who was one
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:42.220]   of the most famous examples of large-scale violence,
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.740]   is he a deep representative of human nature,
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.940]   or is he a rare exception?
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:52.940]   - Well, I think that it's easy to imagine
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.460]   that most men could have become Genghis Khan.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:03.300]   It's possible that he had a particular streak of psychopathy.
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:11.420]   You know, it's striking that by the time you become
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:18.180]   immensely powerful, then your willingness
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:23.100]   to do terrible things for the interest of yourself
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:28.100]   and your group becomes very high.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:36.340]   Stalin, Mao Zedong, these sorts of people have histories
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:42.300]   in which they do not show obvious psychopathy.
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.180]   But by the time they are big leaders,
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.140]   they are really psychopathic in the sense
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:50.860]   that they do not follow the ordinary morality
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:55.620]   of considering the harm that they are doing
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:56.660]   to their victims.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:03.380]   What kind of experiment would we need to discover
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.660]   whether or not anybody could fall into this position?
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:07.620]   I don't know.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:11.780]   But, you know, Lord Acton's famous dictum
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:16.740]   was power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.060]   And then the point that people often forget
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.540]   is the next sentence that he said,
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:24.780]   which is great men are almost always bad men.
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.380]   And that is right.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.860]   It is very difficult to find a great man in history
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:33.020]   who was not responsible for terrible things.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.900]   - I think there's some aspect of it
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.860]   that it's not just power.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:43.300]   I think men who have been the most destructive
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:48.300]   in human history are not psychopathic completely.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:52.940]   They have convinced themselves of an idea.
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.500]   It's like the idea is psychopathic.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.200]   Stalin, for example, Hitler's a complicated one.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.420]   I think he was legitimately insane.
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.000]   But I think Stalin has convinced himself
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.220]   that he's doing good.
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.220]   So the idea of communism is the thing that's psychopathic
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.860]   in his mind, like it bred, you construct a worldview
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:15.620]   in which the violence is justified,
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.480]   the cruelty is justified.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.340]   So there, in that sense, first of all,
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:24.380]   you can construct experiments, unethical experiments
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:25.220]   that could test this.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.980]   But in that sense, anybody else could have been
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.820]   in Stalin's position.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:34.100]   It's the idea that could overtake the mind
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:38.340]   of a human being and in so doing justify cruel acts.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:42.100]   And that seems to be, at least in part, unique to humans,
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.540]   is the ability to hold ideas in our minds
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:49.400]   and share those ideas and use those ideas
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.740]   to convince ourselves that proactive violence
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.120]   on a large scale is a good idea.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.140]   So that, I don't know if you have a comment.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:03:59.980]   - I suppose so.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:04.580]   But it seems to me what really motivated Stalin
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:09.580]   was not so much communism as the retention of power.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:16.460]   So once he became leader
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.140]   and in the process of becoming leader,
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:22.740]   he was absolutely desperate to get rid of anybody
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.140]   who was a challenger.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:28.500]   He was deeply suspicious, suspicious of anybody,
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:32.580]   even on his side, who might possibly be showing
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:36.060]   a glimmerings of willingness to challenge him.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:41.060]   So when he apparently had Kirov murdered,
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:44.420]   Kirov was a great communist.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.940]   Trotsky was a great communist.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.540]   All his rivals.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.340]   And I mean, when he went into the towns
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:55.220]   and murdered people by the tens of thousands.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.220]   - They were all communists.
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:00.140]   - A lot of them were explicit communists, that's right.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.540]   But what he was worried about was
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.340]   that they were rivals to him.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:08.860]   - I suppose the thought is I am the best person
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:13.860]   to bring about a global sort of embrace of communism
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:17.620]   and others are not.
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.700]   And so we have to get rid of those others.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.660]   - Well, I suspect you're being very charitable here,
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.780]   but I mean, maybe you're,
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.700]   you know enough about Stalin to really--
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:30.940]   - Yes, well, so the point I'm making, I do quite a bit,
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:34.420]   is from my understanding and sense,
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.180]   of course we can't know for sure,
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.660]   is he believed in communism.
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:42.780]   This wasn't purely a game of power.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:46.300]   Now he got drunk with power pretty quickly,
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:50.700]   but he really believed for, I believe his whole life,
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:54.100]   that communism is good for the world.
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:59.100]   And that, I don't know what role that belief plays
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:03.820]   with the more natural human desire for power.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.140]   I don't know, but it just seems like--
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.380]   - As we agreed, he's killing a lot of communists
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.460]   on his journey.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:15.580]   - But it's not, that calculus doesn't work that way.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.420]   There's humans who are communists
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.940]   and then there's the idea of communism.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:25.780]   So for him, in his delusional worldview,
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:30.340]   killing a few people is worth the final result
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.740]   of bringing communism to the whole world.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.780]   - But it was more than that again,
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:37.620]   because I mean, he really wanted power for the Soviet Union.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.520]   And so surely the reason that he,
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:47.220]   he orchestrated the export of wheat from Ukraine,
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:53.900]   and in so doing was willing to lead to mass starvation,
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.020]   was because he wanted to sell it on the market
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.500]   in order to be able to build up the power
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.900]   of the Soviet Union.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.820]   You know, alternative view of communism
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:04.660]   might have been, well, you know,
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.180]   let's just make sure everybody survives
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.580]   and make sure everybody has enough to eat
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:13.660]   and we'll all be mutually supportive in a communal network.
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.140]   But no, but he wanted the power for the country.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.340]   - Well, I guess, exactly.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.340]   So it's not even communism,
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:21.820]   the set of ideas are like Marxism or something like that.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.100]   It's the country.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.060]   I guess what I'm saying is
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:29.820]   it's not purely power for the individual.
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.460]   It's power for a vision for this great nation,
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.860]   the Soviet Union.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:37.180]   And similar with Hitler,
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:42.180]   the guy believed that this is a great nation, Germany.
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:46.580]   And like they, it's a nation that's been wronged
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.940]   throughout history and needs to be righted.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.700]   And there's some dance between the individual,
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.580]   human and the tribe.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.020]   - Yes, no, absolutely.
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:59.780]   Yes, and so just like chimpanzees,
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.340]   you know, we are fiercely tribal
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:06.940]   and the tribalism resides particularly in male psychology.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:11.340]   And it's very scary because once you assemble
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:17.140]   a set of males who share a tribal identity,
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:20.420]   then they have power that they can exert
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:25.780]   with very little concern
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.180]   about what they're doing to damage other people.
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:33.900]   - Do you think this, so Nietzschean will to power,
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.140]   we talked about the corrupting nature of power.
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.700]   Do you think that's a manifestation
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.860]   of those early origins of violence?
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:46.020]   What's the connection of this desire for power
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.980]   and our proclivity for violence?
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:54.460]   - You know, what we're talking about is tribal power, right?
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.940]   Power on behalf of a group.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:57.780]   - Yes.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:00.060]   - And I, yeah, that seems to me to go right back
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:04.540]   to a deep evolutionary origin
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.220]   because you see essentially the same thing
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.500]   in a whole bunch of animals.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:14.100]   You know, that most of the sort of
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:18.180]   cognitively complex animals live in social groups
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.220]   in which they have tribal boundaries.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:25.380]   And so what you see in chimpanzees
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:28.820]   is echoed in almost all of the primates.
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:32.740]   The difference between us and, you know,
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.540]   chimpanzees and humans on the one hand
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.600]   and other primates on the other,
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.280]   is that we kill and they don't.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.880]   And the reason they don't is because they never meet
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.960]   in the context where there are massive imbalances of power.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.160]   So two groups of baboons, you know,
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.600]   there's 30 on this side and 50 on this side, fine.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.640]   Nobody's gonna try and kill anybody else
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.580]   because the serious risks involved.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:02.160]   But nevertheless, they are tribal.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.160]   So, you know, they will have fairly intense
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.640]   intergroup interactions in which everybody knows
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.560]   who is on whose side.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:17.560]   And the long-term consequences of winning those battles,
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:23.760]   non-lethal battles, is that the dominance get access
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:28.920]   to larger areas of land, more safety and so on,
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.680]   with chances are better record
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:38.620]   of reproductive success subsequently.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.760]   - Do you think this, from an evolutionary perspective,
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.240]   is a feature or a bug?
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:49.240]   Our natural sort of tendency to form tribes?
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.020]   - So what's a bug?
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:56.600]   - Oh, sorry, this is a computer programming analogy.
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:02.700]   - Meaning like it would be more beneficial,
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:07.780]   is it beneficial or detrimental to form tribes
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:09.220]   from an evolutionary perspective?
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.980]   - Yeah, yeah, but--
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.220]   - What does it mean, what does a bug mean?
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.260]   - Yes, right, I mean--
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.500]   - Well, yeah, 'cause like where's evolution going anyway?
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.740]   - It's beneficial from, you know, it's beneficial
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:22.540]   in the sense that it evolved by natural selection
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:25.420]   to benefit the individuals who did it.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:28.820]   But if by bug you mean something that,
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.240]   from the point of view of the species,
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.580]   it would be great if you could just wipe this out,
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.060]   because the species would somehow do better as a result.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.420]   Then yes, but then, you know, males are a bug.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:46.180]   - Come on now, there's some nice things to males,
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:48.100]   speaking as a male.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.140]   - The fact that there are some nice things to males
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.960]   doesn't mean that they're not bugs.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.900]   You know, maybe they're quite nice bugs,
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.380]   but it would be much better for the species as a whole
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:00.400]   not to have to have males who impose this violence
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.820]   on the species as a whole.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:05.140]   - Yeah, as somebody who practiced controlled violence
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:10.020]   and doing a lot of martial arts, yeah, I'm not sure.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.700]   It does seem kind of fun to have this kind
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.300]   of controlled violence, also sports.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.420]   Also, I mean, the question of conflict in general,
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.540]   I guess that's the deeper question.
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:24.180]   Don't you think there's some value to conflict
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:27.740]   for the improvement of society, for progress?
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:31.060]   That this tension between tribes,
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:35.260]   isn't this like a experiment,
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.660]   a continued experiment we conduct with each other
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.220]   and to figure out what is a better world to build?
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:44.980]   Like you need that conflict of good ideas and bad ideas
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:47.480]   to go to war with each other.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.600]   It's like the United States with the 50 states
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.640]   and it's the laboratory of ideas.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.180]   Don't you think that is, again, feature versus bug?
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:02.960]   This kind of conflict, when it doesn't get out of hand,
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.000]   is actually ultimately progressive,
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.740]   productive for a better world?
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:10.080]   - Well, what do you mean by conflict?
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.880]   I mean, you can have conflict in the sense of
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.520]   people have different ideas about the solution to a problem.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.920]   And so their ideas are in conflict.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.480]   They can sit down with it on a log and chat about it
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.660]   and then decide, okay, you're right,
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.120]   or I'm wrong or whatever.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:33.080]   But if by conflict, you mean a great idea
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.520]   to build a nuclear bomb and set that off,
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.640]   then no, I don't see why it's a good idea
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.960]   to have all this violence.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.560]   - Yeah, there's...
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.880]   (sighs)
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.920]   I wonder, I mean, it's not a good idea,
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.280]   but I wonder if human history would evolve
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.240]   the way it did without the violence.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.760]   - Oh, I'm sure you're right.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.600]   Probably humans would not have evolved
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.680]   in the sense that we have.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:05.680]   But I would hope that the course of violence in evolution
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.960]   will continue in the way it has.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.440]   So there's all sorts of indications
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:20.600]   that the importance of violence has been reduced over time.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:25.760]   And this is made famous in Steven Pinker's book,
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.600]   but others have written about it too,
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.520]   that the frequency of death from violence
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.440]   in every country you look at has been declining.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.280]   That's just great.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.080]   And so, the amazing thing about this
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.240]   is that even when you take the deaths
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.020]   due to the First World War and the Second World War,
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:50.300]   the 20th century appears to have been statistically,
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.920]   meaning rates of death per individual,
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:57.360]   the least violent in history.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:03.240]   So we haven't got very far down the course to nonviolence,
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.720]   but I don't see why we shouldn't just carry on doing it.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.800]   I think it's ridiculous, frankly.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.120]   Excuse my frankness, to say that violence is a good thing.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.840]   I think that it would be a wonderful concept
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.720]   if we could evolve somehow to a world
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.280]   3,000 years from now where violence
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.800]   is really regarded as simply appalling
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.920]   and that they look back on our time
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.560]   and can't believe what we were doing.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.640]   - Yeah, but of course, violence takes
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.760]   a lot of different shapes.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.320]   As we start to think deeper and deeper
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.760]   about living beings on Earth, for example,
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.480]   the violence we commit and the torture
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:45.240]   we commit to animals, and then perhaps down the line,
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.680]   as we've talked offline about,
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.360]   is with robots and that kind of thing.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.640]   So there's just so many ways to commit violence to others.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.480]   And some people now talk about violence
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.200]   in the space of ideas, which of course,
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.640]   to me at least, is a bit of a silly notion
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.840]   relative to use that same V word
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.440]   for the space of ideas versus actual physical violence.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.920]   But it may be that a long time from now,
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.600]   we see that even violence in the space of ideas
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.680]   is quite a manifestation of that same kind of violence.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.480]   And so it is interesting where this is headed.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:23.020]   And I think you're absolutely right.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:26.080]   A world, a nonviolent world,
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.580]   does seem like a better world.
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.620]   I wonder if the constraints on resources
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:34.360]   somehow make that world more and more difficult,
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.120]   especially as we run out of resources.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.480]   - Well, it's got to be very, very different
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.920]   from what we're doing nowadays.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.880]   And it's unimaginably different.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.200]   If we could imagine it, then maybe we could work towards it.
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.480]   At the moment, nobody knows how to work towards it.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.960]   - Well, that's kind of the stories of humans,
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.640]   is we don't really know the future.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.200]   We're trying to ad hoc kind of develop it as we go
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.960]   and sometimes get into trouble.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.040]   - Yeah. - As to violence.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.800]   - But George Orwell's vision in 1984
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.880]   was of two or three world powers,
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:08.880]   each so powerful that nobody could destroy the other.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:16.080]   But the notion of an evolutionarily stable relationship
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:20.160]   among heavily armed world powers
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:25.160]   just does not seem as though it's reasonable at all.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:32.360]   That is to say, we've now got 170 or 190 nations
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.200]   in the world dominated by a few big ones,
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.200]   all with arms pointing at each other.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.320]   And the notion that we could just carry on
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.240]   having peace talks and making sure that these arms
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:54.080]   don't get involved in some kind of massive conflagration
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.960]   seems incredibly optimistic.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.160]   Some kind of major change has to happen,
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.160]   whereby, and some people would like to see
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.080]   all the weapons go, that'd be great.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.840]   I'm a member of that sort of group
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.600]   that tries to see that happen.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.080]   It's gonna be very difficult to see it happen.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.040]   Another kind of concept is the nations themselves
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.040]   will dissolve and will become one government.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.720]   That itself is a terrifying vision
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.040]   because the capacity for abuse by a single world power
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.720]   would be so problematic.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.440]   And in addition, how do you get there
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.120]   without a war in the first place?
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.680]   So at the moment, we have no reasonable
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:41.960]   kind of future in mind, but I'm sure it's there somewhere.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.560]   It's just that we haven't yet defined it.
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.000]   - And a lot of people in the cryptocurrency space
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.600]   argue that you can create decentralized societies
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.240]   if you take away the power from states
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.080]   to define the monetary system.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.680]   So they argue like if you make the monetary system
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.240]   such that it's disjoined from the control
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.940]   of any one individual, any one government,
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:05.720]   then that might be a way to form
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.040]   sort of ad hoc decentralized societies.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.800]   They just pop up all over the place.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.880]   That's a really interesting technological solution
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.960]   to how to remove the overreach of power from governments.
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.000]   - Yes, right, absolutely.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.520]   And it may well be that the future will emerge
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.640]   out of some sort of quite surprising direction like that.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.160]   - Is it nevertheless surprising to you
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:34.240]   that we have not destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons?
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.480]   So the mutually assured destruction
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.440]   that we've had for many decades
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.740]   from somebody who studies violence,
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.240]   how does that make sense to you?
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.440]   - Well, I mean, I'm surprised only in the sense
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.960]   that accidental, the fact that we have not had
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:54.480]   an accident yet has been quite remarkable.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.720]   Because all the accounts are that we've come very close
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.280]   to having very serious accidents
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.120]   where people on either side have misread intentions
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.260]   or apparent launches and so on.
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:08.640]   So yes, I think it is remarkable.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:13.640]   There's a nasty generalization that can be made
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:19.120]   that the longer that powerful states go
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:23.440]   without having wars, then the worse the war is afterwards.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:28.480]   And you can sort of see that that kind of makes sense
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:32.080]   because basically what's happening with these tribal groups
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.800]   that the nations are at the moment
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:39.080]   is that after a big war, like the Second World War,
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.180]   they establish new kinds of dominance relationships.
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:45.760]   And then during the periods of peace,
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:50.760]   what happens is that the de facto dominance relationships
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.540]   change because some nations become poorer,
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:55.960]   some become richer,
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.560]   some become more militarily powerful and so on.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.280]   Generally, economy and military goes hand in hand.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.520]   So right now, China emerged from the war
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.520]   as a relatively low status state and is now high status.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.600]   So if this were chimpanzees, what would happen
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.120]   is that you would predict a conflict
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.120]   because you need to have a readjustment
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.240]   of the formal dominance relationships
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:22.280]   to recognize the new in practice dominance relationships
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.740]   recognized by the economy and the military.
[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:29.220]   So the longer that you have a period of peace
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.320]   following a war, then the more these tensions
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.140]   of unresolved changed dominance relationships build up.
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:39.520]   And the longer they take to occur,
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.520]   then the more challenging are gonna be the conflicts.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.920]   - That's a terrifying view 'cause we've been
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:50.440]   out of conflict for quite a bit.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.680]   - That's right. - Maybe it's building up.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.000]   - So it's a scary view, but on the other hand,
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.600]   things have changed hugely
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.720]   with the advent of nuclear weapons
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:04.720]   because at least that conforms to this psychology
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.720]   that is very clear in other animals,
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.840]   which is you don't want to get into a fight
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.080]   if you are going to get hurt.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.520]   So that's the whole principle of MAD,
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.680]   Mutually Assured Destruction.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.640]   And it's doubtless been why powerful nations
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:22.720]   like America and Russia have not used
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.500]   their nuclear weapons since 1945.
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:32.140]   So if we can overcome the problem of accidental launches,
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:37.300]   then maybe the fact of MAD does fit into human psychology
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:41.400]   in a way that means that we really will resolve our tensions
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.520]   without using them.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:47.440]   But we haven't yet really faced that challenge.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.680]   I mean, the Soviet Union collapsed
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.160]   because of the poor economy,
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.160]   but with China desperate to take back Taiwan
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:03.200]   and America shifting its focus on the Pacific,
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.840]   the potential for something going wrong
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.160]   is clearly very high.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:11.400]   - So what's the hopeful case that you can make
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:15.800]   for a long-term surviving and thriving human civilization,
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.060]   given all the dangers that we face?
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:22.140]   - Well, I can't really exactly make one.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.380]   I would just say that...
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.620]   (Lex laughing)
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:27.500]   We're talking about the dangers.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.860]   Obviously the dangers are there.
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.280]   But what I would sort of think about
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:37.280]   is the notion that surprises come
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.980]   from all sorts of different directions.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:44.900]   I mean, you work in robotics,
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:49.700]   and I could well imagine that there will be advances
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:52.860]   in robotics that in some way I can't even conceive
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:57.860]   will somehow undermine the motivation for conflict.
[01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:01.720]   Something about, by the time chips have been planted
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:05.540]   in human brains and we're all instantly sharing information
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.540]   in a way that we never did before,
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:12.020]   will this change the nature of human existence
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:15.100]   in such a way that these conflicts get resolved?
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.740]   - So remove the conflicts, but keep some of the magic,
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.600]   the beauty of what it means to be human.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.740]   So still be able to enjoy life, the richness of life,
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.700]   the full complexity of life.
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:28.340]   'Cause you can remove conflict by giving everybody a pill,
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.420]   and then they go to sleep, right?
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:35.420]   You still want life to be amazing, exciting, interesting.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:39.880]   And so that's where you have to find the balance.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:42.960]   - Well, it's, yes, I mean, it's all science fiction stuff.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.740]   And so how it's gonna work out, totally unclear.
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:55.040]   I don't see any worry about the magic of life disappearing.
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.880]   I mean, first of all, you somehow get rid of males.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.040]   I think you really need to get rid of males
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:05.040]   'cause males are the source of a major problem,
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:10.640]   which is the lust for power and the resulting conflict.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.320]   - But you don't think the males
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.120]   are also a source of beauty and creation?
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:18.120]   - No, no, no, I mean, I don't have anything against males
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.800]   as individuals and that sort of thing.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.800]   And males have clearly done a lot.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.040]   I mean, they've been incredibly exploratory and creative
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.920]   and what they've done in art and music has been wonderful
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.120]   and that sort of thing.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:34.880]   On the other hand, I'm not sure
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.160]   there's anything particularly special.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.160]   And I think that probably females could do the same thing
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.920]   just as well when given the chance.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.320]   - Yes, including the dark stuff.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.960]   I mean, a part of me is not understanding the,
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:52.600]   so there is evolutionary distinction between men and women,
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.720]   but I tend to believe both men and women,
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:58.640]   if you look out into the future, can be destructive,
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.000]   can be evil, can be greedy, can be corrupted by power.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.640]   So if you move males from the picture,
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:07.160]   which are historically connected to this evolution
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.680]   that we've been talking about,
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.920]   that women are gonna fill that role quite nicely.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:15.080]   And then it'll be just the same kind of process,
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:20.080]   not the same, but it'll be new and interesting.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.040]   There's a sense that the will to power,
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.480]   craving power, committing violence
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.720]   is somehow coupled with all the things
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.560]   that are beautiful about life.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.080]   That if you remove conflict completely,
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.700]   if you remove all the evil in the world,
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:43.720]   it seems like you're going to,
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:47.520]   you're not going to have a stable place
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.440]   for the beauty, for the goodness.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.780]   Like there's always has to be a dragon to fight.
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:56.140]   For the way, if you look at human history,
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:58.820]   now you can say, the reason I'm nervous
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:02.340]   about a sort of utopia where everything is great
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:04.620]   is every time you look through human history,
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.700]   when utopia has been chased,
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:08.460]   you run into a lot of trouble,
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:13.460]   or again, sneaks into this evil, this craving for power.
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.600]   Now you can say that's a male problem,
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.900]   but I just think it's a human problem.
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.420]   And it's not even a human problem,
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:22.060]   it's a chimp problem too.
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:23.620]   It's life on earth problem.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.500]   Intelligent life on earth problem.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:30.500]   So like, it's better to not necessarily get rid
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:34.580]   of the sources of the darker sides of human nature,
[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:38.100]   but more create mechanisms that the kindness,
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:41.780]   the goodness as, the goodness paradox, your book,
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:46.780]   that that is incentivized and encouraged, empowered.
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:54.260]   - Well, look, I don't think it would be utopia
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:56.460]   if you got rid of the males.
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.300]   - Right.
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:00.620]   - And certainly females are capable of conflict.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:03.260]   I just think it's a gamble worth taking
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:04.860]   if you could actually do it.
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:07.100]   You can certainly find females in history
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.300]   who've done unpleasant things.
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:13.500]   But nevertheless, we have a very strong evolutionary theory
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:16.980]   which explains why males benefit more
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:21.520]   by having conflict and winning conflicts than females do.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:27.500]   And so if we want to talk about reducing conflict,
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:31.940]   then it would reduce it to get rid of males.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.100]   Now I understand this is a fantasy.
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:37.100]   And I think it's a fantasy that people would be able
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:38.480]   to talk about fairly soon
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.900]   because reproductive technology is getting to the point
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:46.460]   where it's quite likely that human females
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:49.220]   could breed without the use of males.
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:55.520]   And so there would be a sort of a potential dynamic
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:00.660]   if everybody just agreed not to have any male babies.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:03.740]   - It's a really interesting thought experiment.
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:07.380]   I will agree with you that if given two buttons,
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:09.620]   one is get rid of all women,
[01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:11.780]   and the other button is get rid of all men,
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:18.960]   realizing that I have a stake in this choice,
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.760]   probably getting rid of all men.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.640]   If I wanted to preserve Earth
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:28.400]   and the richness of life on Earth,
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.240]   I would probably get rid of all men.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.080]   I don't know.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.320]   - I don't think you have a stake in it.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:35.280]   You know, I mean, you're saying that because you're a man.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.120]   - Yeah.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:39.520]   - But I don't see why being a man should make you
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.600]   any more interested in having a male future for the world
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:43.600]   than a female future.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.960]   You know, you've got just as many ancestors
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.360]   who were male as were female.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.320]   - Well, my problem is I'll have to die.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:53.720]   - Well, that's gonna happen anyway.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:57.000]   - I know, but like I prefer to die tomorrow, not today.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.560]   You know, I prefer to hit the snooze button
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.760]   on the whole mortality thing.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:03.600]   But it's interesting.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.560]   - But this is not suggesting that males have to die
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.800]   in order to make room for females.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:11.480]   It's just, you know, all you have to do is just say,
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:13.320]   don't let's have any more males born.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.760]   - Interesting.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.600]   - Of course, you know, the difficulty is that
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:19.840]   because we're tribal, you know, some country somewhere
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.360]   would say, well, we're not gonna do that.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.200]   - Yeah.
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.020]   - And then guess what?
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:24.760]   They'd take over, you know, because they're male.
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.760]   So that's why it's impossible to imagine actually happening.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:31.040]   - You know what, I'm gonna take that
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.200]   and actually think about it.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.920]   I don't know, I'm uncomfortable.
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:39.280]   There's a certain kind of woke culture
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.600]   that I've been kind of uncomfortable with
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.520]   because it's not women necessarily.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:48.280]   It's more just, there's a lot of bullying I see.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.880]   There's a lack of empathy and a lack of kindness
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.440]   towards others that's created by that culture.
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.200]   So, but you're speaking about something else.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.200]   You're speaking about reducing conflict in this world
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:04.440]   and looking at the basics of our human nature
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:09.440]   and its origins in the evolution of Homo sapiens
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:14.440]   and thinking about which kind of aspects of human nature,
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.320]   if we get rid of them, will make for a better world.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.840]   It's an interesting thought experiment.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:20.680]   Worth thinking about.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.680]   - But it is only a thought experiment.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.960]   I mean, you know, it's got no practical meaning right now.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:28.280]   And I take your point that, you know,
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:32.440]   males get a hard rap nowadays in some ways
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:37.440]   because the balance of social power
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.640]   is moving against, I mean, you know, quite rightly
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.120]   and in a strong sense, of course,
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:50.040]   against all the nasty things that males do.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:55.680]   But what people sometimes fail to remember
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:00.600]   is that life is very hard for males
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:05.600]   who don't have the power, who don't have money,
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.880]   who don't have access to women.
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:13.680]   You know, I'm sympathetic to incels.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:18.400]   I'm not sympathetic to them using violence
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.200]   to solve their problems,
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:25.200]   but I am very sympathetic to the fact that it's not easy
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.280]   simply to be told by well-off,
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:36.520]   feminist, middle-class people
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.080]   that you shouldn't behave like this
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.360]   or you shouldn't feel like this, because you do.
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.360]   - Yes, it's who you are.
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.960]   I mean, in general, just empathy and kindness,
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:51.960]   male or female, I believe,
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:54.360]   will be the thing that builds a better world.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:57.360]   And that's practiced in different ways
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:58.660]   from different backgrounds,
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:01.580]   but ultimately you should listen to others
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:04.120]   and empathize with the experience of others
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.480]   and put more love out there in the world.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.360]   Now, that hopefully is the way to reduce conflict,
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:15.280]   reduce violence, and reduce that whole psychological
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.820]   experience of being powerless in this world,
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:22.520]   powerless to become the best version of yourself.
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.360]   And that, you know-
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.440]   - Well, no one's gonna disagree
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:27.160]   with all those fine sentiments, right?
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:32.020]   But that, yes, but that's an actionable thing
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:35.140]   is actually practice empathy, right?
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:40.100]   Like saying that somebody should be silenced
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:43.800]   or just like this group is bad and this group is good.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.380]   I just feel like that's not empathy.
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:50.380]   Empathy is understanding the experience of others
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:52.960]   and respecting it.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:57.260]   Like, I mean, that's what a better world looks like.
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.740]   That's what the reduction of conflict looks like.
[01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:03.700]   It's like, as opposed to saying my tribe is right,
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:07.140]   your tribe is wrong, forget the violence
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:08.740]   or non-violence part.
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:11.180]   That just that act of saying my tribe is right,
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:13.620]   that tribe is wrong, removing that from the picture.
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:15.720]   That's the way to make a better world.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.320]   Like that's the way to reduce the violence, I think.
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.740]   Not necessarily removing the people
[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:24.140]   who are causing the violence.
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.940]   You have to get to the source of the problem.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:27.260]   I don't mean the evolutionary source,
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:32.260]   but just the mindset that creates the violence
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:35.960]   is usually just the lack of empathy for others.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.460]   - Yeah, but you know, I mean, you can't just teach that
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:43.540]   because our evolutionary psychology
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:45.540]   puts us in particular directions.
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:49.540]   - So you don't think, do you think it's possible to learn
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:53.980]   through practice to resist the basics
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.900]   of our evolutionary psychology, the basic forces?
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:01.660]   - Yeah, I mean, lots and lots of training,
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:05.060]   you know, lots and lots of education can do it.
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:09.220]   The famously most peaceful society
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:11.860]   that anthropologists have recorded
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:16.860]   involves a tremendous amount of teaching,
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:18.900]   including some punishment.
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:20.940]   You know, it's a society in Thailand.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:25.940]   You have to beat it out of children to make 'em nice.
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.780]   - So it's carrot and steak.
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:31.300]   - You know, the point is that you do not find societies
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:34.340]   in which people are spontaneously
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:39.160]   showing the kinds of behaviors
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.980]   that we would all love them to show.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:43.300]   - It requires work.
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.100]   - It requires work.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.940]   - What is your book titled "Goodness Paradox"?
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:50.300]   What are the main ideas in this book?
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:55.300]   - Well, the paradox is the fact that humans show extremes
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:36:00.460]   in relationship to both violence and nonviolence.
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:04.220]   And the violence is that we are one of these few animals
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:08.860]   in which we use coalitionary proactive violence
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:10.700]   to kill members of our own species.
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:12.220]   And we do it in large numbers,
[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:14.700]   just like a few other species.
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:18.900]   And the nonviolence is we're particularly extreme
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:23.860]   in how repressed we are in terms of reactive violence.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:26.900]   And I told you the story of how we get there.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:28.620]   So what's so extraordinary about us
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:32.940]   is that most animals are either high on both
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:35.420]   or relatively low on both.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:38.340]   So chimpanzees are high on proactive violence
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:40.020]   and reactive violence.
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:44.220]   Bonobos are less than chimpanzees on both of those,
[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:46.340]   but still hundreds of times more
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:49.900]   reactively aggressive than humans are.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:54.940]   What we've done is retain proactive violence being high
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:59.180]   and got reactive violence really being low.
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:01.140]   And so we have these wonderful societies
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:03.740]   in which we're all so incredibly nice to each other
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:07.020]   and tolerant and calm and can meet strangers
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:12.020]   and have no problem about leading to any kind of conflict.
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:15.780]   At the same time as we are one of the worst
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:19.660]   killing machine species that's ever existed.
[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:21.460]   So what's so extraordinary about this
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:24.820]   is that if you look at the political philosophers
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:26.820]   of the last few hundred years,
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.900]   you've got this fight famously
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:33.300]   between Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:36.340]   or literally you've got the fight between their followers.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:38.580]   So the followers of Hobbes say,
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:40.900]   "Well, Hobbes was right, but we're not."
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.900]   Well, Hobbes was right because he says
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:46.460]   that we are naturally violent and you need a leviathan,
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:49.340]   a sort of central government or a king
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:51.740]   to be able to suppress the violence.
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:55.900]   So we're naturally horrid and we can learn to be good.
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:58.260]   Whereas Jean-Jacques Rousseau is interpreted
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:01.420]   as saying the opposite, that we are naturally good
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:03.460]   and it's only when culture intervenes
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:08.380]   and horrid ideologies come in that we become uncivilized.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:10.900]   And so people have had this endless fight
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:15.900]   between are we naturally corrupt or are we naturally kind?
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:19.700]   And that has gone on for years.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:23.060]   And it's only in the last two or three decades
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:25.220]   that anthropologists like Christopher Bohm
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:26.500]   and Bruce Naft have said,
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.660]   "Look, it's obvious what the answer is.
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:30.420]   We are both of these things."
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.660]   And what is so exciting now is I think
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:34.900]   we can understand why we are both.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:38.240]   And the answer is we come from ancestors
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.700]   that were elevated on proactive aggression,
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:43.740]   that were hunters and killers,
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:46.520]   both of animals and of each other.
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.260]   And you've got to include that
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:52.900]   as almost certain from the past.
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:57.900]   And then now we've taken our reactive aggression
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:02.540]   and we've down-regulated it and that's given us power.
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:05.820]   It's given us power because once you get rid
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:08.560]   of the alpha male, once the beta males take over
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:13.360]   and force selection in favor of a more tolerant,
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.080]   less reactively aggressive individual,
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:22.000]   the effect is that our cultures suddenly become capable
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.960]   of focusing on things other than conflict.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:28.880]   And so we have social groups in which individuals,
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:30.960]   instead of constantly being on edge
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:33.320]   in the way that chimpanzees are with each other,
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:38.320]   are able to interact in ways that enable them
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.760]   to share looking at a tool together
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.040]   or share their food together
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:47.240]   or pass ideas from one to the other
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.560]   or support each other when they're ill
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.680]   or whatever the issue is,
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.120]   cooperate in ways that make the group far more effective.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.240]   So you asked earlier, you know,
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:01.680]   what did I think about why sapiens were able to expand
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:04.240]   at the expense of Neanderthals so dramatically
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.680]   around 40,000 years ago?
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:11.260]   And the answer is that whatever it was,
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:14.440]   it had something to do with the sapiens' ability
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.900]   to cooperate.
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:18.220]   You know, that was what gave them bigger groups.
[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:23.220]   That's what enabled them to have a far more effective way
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:26.200]   of living and I suspect it was to do with the weapons
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:29.920]   and military aspects, but even if it wasn't that,
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:34.920]   the greater cooperation that sapiens were showing
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.880]   would have been hugely important.
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:40.400]   So sapiens then had groups of, you know,
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.080]   who knows exactly how big they were,
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:47.080]   but scores of people to judge from their remains,
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:52.840]   whereas Neanderthals were living in widely separated,
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:56.220]   small groups of, you know, maybe as many as 15
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:57.800]   or 20 people sometimes,
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:02.240]   where they saw others so rarely that they were inbreeding
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:03.960]   at high levels, you know,
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:07.180]   fathers having babies with their daughters.
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:09.760]   Very different world.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.600]   - Very different world.
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.280]   - And that's probably what our world was like
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.640]   before we got sapiens.
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:14.920]   - Before we got sapiens.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:18.320]   And it's fascinating that there was that kind of violence
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.320]   against, once you get rid of the alpha males,
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:29.440]   you have now the freedom to have kindness amongst the beta,
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.280]   the beta males, like not kindness,
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.480]   but collaboration, that's the better word.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.520]   - Yes, right, much more collaboration,
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.900]   not just among the males, among the beta males,
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:42.760]   but also among the gamma males and the females.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.880]   - Yeah, I don't know what a gamma male is,
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:47.560]   but I imagine there's a whole alphabet.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.760]   - Well, I don't know about a whole alphabet,
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:51.840]   but I think the big layers are the married men
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.040]   and the unmarried men,
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.280]   because the married men had a problem
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.160]   with the unmarried men, right?
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.200]   I mean, you see it in ethnographies
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.240]   of hunters and gatherers recently,
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:06.340]   where the unmarried men would be given rules,
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:08.720]   such as, I mean, a very extreme rule
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:12.680]   in Northern Australia was you cannot come to the camp
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:14.560]   for months, you have to go away
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:17.280]   and live somewhere out in the bush,
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.000]   'cause we don't want you anywhere near our wives.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.960]   And then another kind of rule is,
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.040]   if you are in the camp,
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.720]   you must be in the firelight all the time,
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:30.720]   otherwise we don't know what you're doing out in the dark.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.920]   So we're looking at real efforts to control them,
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.920]   because the men who had lots of wives
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:38.680]   did not want those horrid bachelors
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.320]   sneaking around the place.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.160]   - I love this.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.000]   You also wrote the book titled "Catching Fire,
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.620]   How Cooking Made Us Human."
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:49.800]   What's the central idea in this book?
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.480]   - The subtitle "How Cooking Made Us Human"
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.320]   refers not to Homo sapiens, but to Homo erectus.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:59.060]   So human there means the genus Homo.
[01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:03.720]   And Homo erectus is the first full member
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.720]   of the genus Homo in the sense that it looked like us,
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:12.160]   just with a sort of slightly more robust build
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:14.120]   and a smaller brain.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:17.360]   And the central idea of "Catching Fire"
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:22.080]   is that it was the control of fire
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:27.080]   that was responsible for the emergence of Homo erectus
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:30.800]   and therefore the genus Homo,
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.040]   which happened two million years ago.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:36.560]   And it was an evolution
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:41.560]   from a line of australopithecines.
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:46.400]   And australopithecines are the creatures
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.360]   from whom we evolved.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:52.880]   They were present in Africa
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.120]   from something like six or seven million years ago,
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:01.560]   up to, actually up to one million years ago.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:04.800]   And then a branch led off to Homo
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.400]   around two million years ago.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:10.120]   And the way to think of australopithecines
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.080]   is that they were like chimpanzees standing upright.
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:17.040]   So they were erect bipedal walkers.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.120]   They were like chimpanzees in the sense
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.320]   that they had brains about the size of a chimpanzee.
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:28.040]   They were literally about the body size of a chimpanzee,
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:29.560]   a little bit smaller actually.
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:32.520]   And they had big jaws
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:36.860]   because they were still eating raw food.
[01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:39.600]   They had big teeth and big jaws.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.800]   And then around two million years ago,
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.240]   the line of australopithecines,
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:47.080]   which ended with an intermediate species,
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.400]   a kind of missing link area,
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:53.000]   'cause it is not missing, called habilis,
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.520]   sometimes called Homo habilis,
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:56.080]   but more properly in my view,
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.920]   called australopithecus habilis.
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.440]   That gave rise to Homo erectus.
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.000]   And Homo erectus, here's how different it was.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.880]   It had a smaller mouth,
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.560]   a smaller jaw,
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.200]   smaller teeth,
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:17.760]   and to judge from its ribs and pelvis, smaller gut.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:23.360]   In addition, it had lost what australopithecines all had,
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.360]   which was adaptations for climbing in the trees.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:29.080]   And that meant that Homo erectus
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.580]   must have slept on the ground.
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:34.160]   And since it slept on the ground,
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.800]   it should have been able to defend itself
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.600]   somehow against predators.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.680]   And I can't think of any way they could have done that
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.860]   unless they had fire.
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:46.860]   So there are two major clues to why it was with Homo erectus
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:55.100]   that our ancestors first acquired the control of fire.
[01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:58.740]   One is the fact that they were clearly not sleeping in trees
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:01.620]   in the way that chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:04.000]   and all the other primates do.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:10.220]   And the other is that there was this striking reduction
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:13.020]   throughout the gut,
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:17.340]   reduction in size of the mouth and the chewing apparatus
[01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:19.300]   and in the gut itself.
[01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:24.300]   And that conforms to what we see nowadays about humans,
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:28.580]   which is that our guts are about two thirds of the size
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:31.940]   of what they would be if we ate raw food
[01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:34.400]   to judge by the great apes.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.520]   So at some point in our evolution,
[01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:43.080]   we acquired the skill of cooking
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:44.780]   and skill of controlling fire.
[01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:50.700]   At no time between two million years ago and the present,
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:54.860]   do we see any changes in our anatomy that can,
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:59.860]   as it were, justify the enormous change that happens
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:04.180]   when you are an animal that learns to control fire.
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:05.340]   But at two million years ago,
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:07.260]   we have exactly what you'd expect,
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:09.860]   namely the guts becoming smaller
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:11.980]   because the food is becoming softer
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:13.620]   and much more easy to digest.
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:17.200]   So you don't have to work so hard in your body to digest it.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:21.260]   And as I say, a commitment to sleeping on the ground,
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:25.620]   which I think you'd be absolutely crazy to do nowadays
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:29.820]   on a moonless night in the middle of Serengeti
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:31.260]   unless you had fire.
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.420]   I've slept out quite a lot in various parts of Africa
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:37.940]   in the bush and you will not catch me
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:42.460]   just lying on the ground in an area with lots of predators
[01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:43.940]   unless I got a fire with me.
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:46.140]   - You're going to get eaten.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:49.120]   - You're gonna get terrified and you're gonna get eaten.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.980]   - Okay, so there's a million questions I wanna ask.
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:55.820]   So one, is it very naturally coupled
[01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:59.500]   the discovery of controlled fire and cooking with fire?
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.440]   Is that an obvious leap?
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:03.260]   - Well, here's what we know.
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:06.780]   We know that all the animals that we've tested
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:10.640]   like to eat their food cooked more than they like it raw.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.140]   So this is true for all the great apes.
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:14.260]   We've tested them.
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:17.340]   - That's fascinating, by the way.
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:18.420]   Why is that?
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:20.980]   That's just like a property of food, I suppose.
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:25.900]   - Yes, I think what it is is that animals are always looking
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:30.900]   for any kind of way to get food that is easier to digest.
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:33.740]   And there are various signals in the food
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.740]   such as the amount of sugar there,
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.900]   the amount of free amino acids
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:40.740]   'cause the amino acids can be tasted.
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:44.660]   And the physical qualities of the food
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:47.460]   be particularly important, how tough the food is.
[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:52.140]   Always prefer softer food provided it feels safe,
[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:53.860]   tastes safe.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:56.980]   And these kinds of sensory cues
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:00.420]   are all there in cooked food.
[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:04.700]   It's soft, it doesn't have so many toxins,
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:08.500]   it's not so noxious to taste, easier to chew.
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:11.940]   So everyone loves it spontaneously.
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:14.500]   Your dogs and your cats prefer cooked food to raw food.
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:16.580]   Well, maybe you can say that's a consequence
[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:17.420]   of domestication.
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:20.120]   But even, as I say, all of the great apes,
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:25.940]   you test naive ones and they prefer it cooked if they can.
[01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:28.020]   - So then obvious once you have fire,
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:31.300]   you're going to accidentally discover that food changes
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:32.540]   when you apply fire to it
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:37.300]   and then it's going to be the big crazy new fad.
[01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:39.020]   - Yeah, you took the words out of my mouth.
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:41.180]   I mean, if they have fire at all
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:43.900]   and their food rolls into it,
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:46.820]   five minutes later it tastes better than it did before.
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:50.380]   - How big of an invention from an engineering perspective
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.060]   do you think is the discovery of fire?
[01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:57.980]   Do you think for the fire to be discovered,
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:00.260]   for Homo erectus, Homo sapiens,
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.560]   do you think it's the greatest invention ever?
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:09.180]   - Yeah, I think that the control of fire
[01:50:09.180 --> 01:50:14.260]   has been ultimately responsible for essentially
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:17.540]   how grandiose do I want to be here?
[01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:21.780]   You know, the entire human story, going back to Homo,
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:26.280]   is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal.
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:29.060]   And perhaps the biggest way
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:31.140]   in which it is likely to have changed us
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:36.140]   is it reduced the difficulty of making a large brain.
[01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:41.220]   So, you know, the story here is that
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:46.000]   the constraints on brain size are energetic.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.500]   You and I have brains that are something like
[01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:55.820]   2.5% of our body weight.
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:51:02.100]   It consumes around 25% of all of our calories.
[01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:05.480]   So it's disproportionate.
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:08.600]   There are other expensive organs in our body as well,
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:09.740]   such as the heart.
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:15.920]   And what's different about the brain is that
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:18.760]   in addition to us being able to fuel it
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:21.160]   in a way that other animals can't,
[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:24.980]   we also have reasons for wanting to have an even bigger brain
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:27.080]   whereas we don't want an even bigger heart.
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:31.020]   So what those reasons are is unclear.
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:36.020]   But with regard to the costs of maintaining a brain,
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:38.580]   cooking makes it possible
[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:42.620]   because it's supplying more calories
[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:46.020]   and it is enormously reducing the amount of time
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:48.500]   that it takes to chew your food.
[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:49.820]   So if you were a gorilla
[01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:53.320]   and you wanted to have a bigger brain,
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:56.880]   you might say, "Okay, well, let's just eat some more."
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:01.880]   But gorillas are eating for pretty much the entire day
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:05.760]   in the sense that they are eating for
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:10.480]   maybe seven or eight hours a day in some seasons.
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.300]   That's just chewing.
[01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:13.680]   And then they've got to sit around and digest their food
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:15.620]   because they can't just eat all the time.
[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:17.240]   They've got to take a break
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:21.640]   while the food is digested in the stomach
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:23.800]   and then passed into the gut.
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:25.840]   So the stomach is already full.
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:29.080]   So basically gorillas are eating
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.220]   about the maximum rate already.
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:33.500]   So how does a gorilla get a bigger brain?
[01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:34.600]   It doesn't.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:36.080]   It's actually got a smaller brain
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:39.100]   relative to its body size than chimpanzee does.
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:44.100]   And that's the basic problem for our ancestors.
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.000]   Then you come along and cook,
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.380]   and all of a sudden you can get an increased amount
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:50.900]   of energy from your food.
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:55.540]   You are spending much less energy on digesting your food.
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:00.300]   There are 25 bodily processes or more
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:03.220]   that are involved in digesting your food,
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:06.880]   making the acid that takes the proteins apart,
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:09.420]   maintaining the brush border
[01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:13.380]   where the molecules are taken across the gut wall,
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.020]   and so on.
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:16.300]   That all costs.
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:17.900]   It costs you to digest your food.
[01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:19.580]   It costs less if you cook your food.
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:22.780]   So you get a net gain in the amount of energy.
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:25.700]   And you are reducing the amount of time
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:29.100]   from, in our case, our ancestors,
[01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:32.940]   probably around 50% of the day chewing,
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:36.460]   to nowadays one hour a day chewing.
[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:38.260]   So all of a sudden you've got hours a day
[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:39.820]   in which to do other things,
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:44.220]   to use those brains that you've now enabled to grow.
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:45.620]   So with Homo erectus,
[01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:47.980]   you start the process of getting a bigger brain,
[01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:50.500]   and famously, throughout the whole period
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.540]   of the evolution of the genus Homo,
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:56.260]   you have a steadily increasing size of brain.
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:54:00.940]   Until right at the end when it actually gets smaller,
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:02.460]   but that's a different story.
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:04.020]   - Which end is this?
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:06.260]   Which, are we talking about Homo sapiens?
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:07.840]   - Yeah, with Homo sapiens,
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:10.660]   you get a smaller brain from,
[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:13.220]   people haven't got it exactly down,
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:17.260]   but at least 30,000 years ago, it starts declining.
[01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:20.420]   And so the fascinating thing about that
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:23.420]   is that all domesticated animals have smaller brains
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:25.500]   than their wild ancestors.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.420]   And I...
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:32.820]   - The domestication is intricately connected
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:34.260]   to this brain size, you think?
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:35.700]   - And exactly.
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:37.180]   So I think what we're seeing in humans
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:39.860]   is that same manifestation.
[01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:43.380]   And then the fascinating question is why?
[01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:45.660]   And the only point I would want to make about this
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:48.860]   is that there's no evidence that
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:51.740]   in the small brain domesticates,
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:55.620]   they're losing, say, an average about 15% of brain size.
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:56.980]   In the small brain domesticates
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:58.420]   compared to their wild ancestors,
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:02.640]   there's no indication of a loss of cognitive ability.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:05.460]   So I think what's going on is that
[01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:10.460]   it's a younger brain, it's a more pedomorphic brain,
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:13.920]   and it looking like the juveniles of the ancestor,
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:17.480]   but just as our kids are very smart
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:19.900]   and can learn amazing things compared to adults,
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:21.860]   all they lack is wisdom and maturity,
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:25.560]   but in terms of sheer cognitive ability, they got it.
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:27.620]   And I think that's the same with domesticated animals
[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:28.860]   compared to their wild ancestors,
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:32.620]   and probably therefore with Homo sapiens,
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:36.860]   say 30,000 years ago, compared to their ancestors.
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:39.060]   So we have smaller brains than Neanderthals.
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:43.340]   - Size, Richard, isn't everything.
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:44.180]   - Exactly.
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:47.300]   - What's the connection between fire,
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:50.460]   cooking, and the eating of meat?
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:53.160]   Which came first, do you think?
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:56.940]   Humans starting to enjoy the eating of meat
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:01.440]   or the invention of fire and the use of fire for cooking?
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:04.380]   - I think that fire increased the using of meat,
[01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:09.380]   but the fact that chimpanzees really like to hunt
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:14.500]   and kill meat, as do bonobos, certainly puts us in,
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:18.260]   so those two species have a common ancestor
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:20.540]   with us going six, seven million years ago,
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.220]   and it was from that common ancestor
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:24.140]   that you get the Australopithecine line.
[01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:26.340]   It's very likely, therefore, Australopithecines
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:28.300]   were eating meat when they could get it,
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:29.340]   which wouldn't be very often
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.960]   'cause they wouldn't be very good sprinters,
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:33.220]   but nevertheless, they would occasionally
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:34.660]   be able to get some meat,
[01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:36.580]   and I bet they loved it all the time,
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:39.340]   and basically all primates like meat if they can get it,
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:40.300]   almost all of them.
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:44.780]   But I think fire would have been very important
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:48.020]   for a couple of reasons.
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:53.020]   One is that once you eat your food cooked,
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:54.660]   then you're saving yourself time.
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:58.980]   By saving yourself time, you can free up
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:03.540]   the opportunity to go and hunt more
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:06.400]   'cause hunting is a high-risk, high-gain activity.
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:10.680]   There's every risk that you will get nothing
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:13.860]   on one particular afternoon that you go off
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:16.580]   looking for opportunities to kill,
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:20.140]   but it's high gain because when you do get something,
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:21.840]   you bring down a kudu,
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:24.380]   then you've got a serious amount of meat.
[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:29.140]   What did males and females do with the time
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:32.740]   they were saving from not having to chew their food?
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:35.300]   I think that in the case of males,
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:36.300]   it's very reasonable to think,
[01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:39.580]   they spent a greatly increased amount of time hunting.
[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:44.300]   So chimpanzees, they hunt maybe two or three times a month,
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:46.560]   and the average hunt length is 20 minutes.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:52.580]   With humans, they're hunting maybe 20 times a month,
[01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:55.380]   and the average hunt length is six hours.
[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:56.980]   Yeah, so it's a huge difference.
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:57.820]   - Yeah.
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:00.460]   - So, and that's possible because the time was available
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:01.820]   because they were cooking.
[01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:03.460]   - Less chewing, more hunting.
[01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:04.300]   - You got it.
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:05.140]   (laughing)
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:10.140]   The other thing is that the meat is so much nicer.
[01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:11.460]   - Yeah.
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:14.180]   - So when a chimpanzee kills a monkey,
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:17.620]   and I mean, they are so excited about killing a monkey.
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:19.500]   They are so excited about going into the hunt,
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:23.940]   and when they make the kill, then there's screams everywhere
[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:27.500]   and some try to seize it and capture it
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:28.860]   and take it away from the others,
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:32.100]   and eventually the strongest one has it,
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:34.100]   and the others sit around begging
[01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:35.820]   and trying to get some and tear it off,
[01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:37.660]   and so they all love it.
[01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:41.540]   There are others who, he often goes to the top of a tree
[01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:42.620]   in order to be able to get away
[01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:44.660]   from all of these beggars and scavengers,
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:49.060]   and while he's there, drops of blood or little scraps
[01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:50.380]   will fall down to the bottom,
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:52.940]   and the junior members of society,
[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:55.420]   the females and young and that sort of thing,
[01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:58.780]   they are racing through to find a particular leaf
[01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:00.740]   that's got a drop of blood on it so they can lick it.
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:02.180]   I mean, they love it.
[01:59:02.180 --> 01:59:04.100]   (laughing)
[01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:08.100]   But it takes them a lot of time to chew it.
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:11.500]   I mean, it's the same thing as for cooked food in general.
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:16.500]   So they are getting meat very slowly into their bodies,
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.620]   and there sometimes comes a time when they just say,
[01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:22.020]   I've had enough of this, I need real food,
[01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:25.940]   and they'll drop the meat and go off and eat fruit again
[01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:28.020]   because they can get fruit into their bodies
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:29.980]   so much faster than they can get meat.
[01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:34.900]   So once they're cooking, that problem is solved,
[01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:37.380]   and they can eat the meat so just much more readily.
[01:59:37.380 --> 01:59:40.260]   So I think that meat eating will become important
[01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:42.460]   for two reasons with cooking.
[01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:45.940]   - So the key, not to oversimplify,
[01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:48.620]   but the key moments in human history
[01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:52.860]   are with the Homo erectus, the discovery of fire
[01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:55.300]   and the use of fire for cooking,
[01:59:55.300 --> 02:00:00.300]   and then with Homo sapiens, the beta males
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:03.320]   killing off the alpha males so that the cooperation
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:07.060]   can exist, and cooperation leads to communication
[02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:09.540]   and language and ideas, the sharing of ideas,
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:10.820]   that kind of thing.
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:13.780]   - Well, yes, the only thing I would modify on that
[02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:17.540]   is that you have to ask, how is it that the beta males
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:20.000]   were able to kill the alpha male?
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.720]   And we now know that although chimpanzees do kill males
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:27.820]   within their own group sometimes,
[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:31.300]   it's not a process of killing the alpha male.
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:33.120]   It's taking advantage of opportunity
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:36.320]   when some male gets into a bad position,
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:39.420]   but it's not a systematic ability to kill the alpha male.
[02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:42.900]   And you can see why, 'cause they don't have language.
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:46.520]   And without language, it's very difficult to know
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:50.160]   how confident you can be of the support of others
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:53.940]   against a particular individual within your own group.
[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:55.700]   When you're attacking someone from another group,
[02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:56.980]   that problem is solved.
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:01:01.620]   You know, we all hate the, you know, those guys.
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:06.620]   But the alpha male has got alliances within his group.
[02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:10.600]   Some of those allies might be willing to turn against him.
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.500]   Some of them might be harboring deep feelings
[02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:17.840]   of resentment, but how does anyone else know that?
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:20.200]   So in other words, I think that you have to have
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:23.820]   some kind of language that is pretty good
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:27.800]   to solve the problems of gaining confidence
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:32.640]   that five of you say, you know, or some number
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:38.560]   can trust each other in this final attack.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.800]   And, you know, even nowadays it's difficult.
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:44.280]   - I mean, you mentioned Stalin.
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:48.460]   It's like, why was everybody terrified?
[02:01:48.460 --> 02:01:50.240]   Any dictator that takes control,
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.280]   why is all of us as individuals terrified
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:55.180]   when you know there's millions of us?
[02:01:55.180 --> 02:01:57.040]   - That's right.
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:00.060]   - And so like that, we lack the language
[02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:04.460]   because our basic psychology of fear overtakes us.
[02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:06.220]   Like who can we talk to?
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:08.660]   Who can we talk to and not get killed ourselves?
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:10.460]   - Exactly, that's right.
[02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:14.180]   But do you have this intuition that some kind of language
[02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:18.680]   was developing along with this process
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:20.180]   of beta males taking over?
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:21.020]   - Yes, yes.
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:23.740]   I mean, once you have sufficient language
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.820]   to be able to have the beta males conspiring
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:30.100]   to kill the alpha male, then you have selection
[02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:33.940]   in favor of cooperation and tolerance, as we spoke about.
[02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:38.220]   And at that point, there will be increased ability
[02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:40.020]   to communicate and the language will get richer
[02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:41.660]   and better and better.
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:44.380]   So yes, absolutely, positive feedback loop
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:47.000]   once you get the situation started.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.060]   - Can you maybe comment on the full complexity
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:55.700]   and richness of the human mind through this process?
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:03:00.580]   We've been casually saying cooking, fire,
[02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:05.580]   and beta males leading to cooperation.
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:09.540]   But how does the beauty of the human mind
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:10.660]   emerge from all of this?
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:13.060]   Is there other further steps we need to understand?
[02:03:13.060 --> 02:03:16.500]   Or is it as simple as this language emerging
[02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:21.260]   from taking over the alpha male and the cooperation?
[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:23.860]   Or am I also over-romanticizing
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:25.780]   how amazing the human mind is?
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:27.660]   Is it just like one small step
[02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:30.260]   in a long journey of evolution?
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:34.600]   - Well, if the beauty of the human mind
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:39.600]   is the ability of us all to be creative,
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:47.840]   to explore, that's one kind of beauty.
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:55.240]   Another kind of beauty is the empathy that we can show.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:58.040]   And we think of that as beautiful
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:03.040]   because it is a kind of rare and special ability
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:08.440]   compared to the sort of ordinary selfishness
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:12.400]   that can commonly predominate.
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:17.240]   I suppose we have to think of different sources
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:19.080]   for those two types.
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:24.560]   I suppose a general answer is that
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:29.160]   there has been selection in favor of bigger brains,
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:31.920]   which probably in general has been associated
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:33.840]   with increasing cognitive ability.
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:35.840]   And as that has happened,
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:41.100]   the complexity of life has increased
[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:45.880]   because people have more and more complex,
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:48.400]   highly differentiated strategies
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:51.300]   in response to each other's more complex,
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:53.560]   highly differentiated strategies.
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:55.760]   We get to a point where there is deception
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:57.920]   and self-deception.
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:02.800]   There is a manipulation of ideas
[02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:05.200]   through stories that we invent
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:07.200]   and stories that we pass on.
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:12.160]   I guess all I'm wanting to say is that
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:17.200]   there is a world of the mind
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:22.200]   that evolves in response to these platforms
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:25.880]   that are put there.
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:28.720]   The platform of increasing brain size
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:30.120]   and therefore cognitive ability
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:34.120]   made possible by increased energy supply.
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:38.960]   The platform of cooperation and tolerance
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:42.920]   in a world in which there remains a lot of conflict
[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:46.480]   and therefore a need to respond to the conflict
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:49.080]   and manipulate your allies appropriately.
[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:53.400]   I don't see either kind of beauty
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:54.960]   that's coming sort of totally independently
[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:55.880]   of these things.
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:58.760]   I don't think there's a selection
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:02.640]   for staring into the sunset and creating poetry.
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:03.480]   - Yes.
[02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:06.240]   - But I guess sexual selection,
[02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:10.400]   males wanting to impress females in different ways
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:13.680]   will lead to them wanting to--
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.160]   - Write poetry?
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:16.760]   - Well, yes, show off.
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:18.520]   - Yeah, in all the different ways.
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:20.640]   So all of these are natural consequences
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:23.440]   of just coming up with strategies
[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:27.240]   of how to cooperate and how to achieve certain ends.
[02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:28.920]   So that's just like a natural--
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:31.960]   - Yeah, I mean, we haven't spoken about sexual selection,
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:34.240]   but that is a really important part of it.
[02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:37.240]   They try to out-compete each other
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:43.080]   normally without any physical conflict
[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:45.080]   just in order to be able to be chosen
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:46.920]   by mates of the opposite sex.
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:51.240]   And that is certainly a major source of creativity.
[02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:56.200]   - So you've studied chimps.
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:59.320]   You also, all the other relatives, gorillas.
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:01.920]   What do you find beautiful and fascinating about chimps,
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.780]   about gorillas, about humans?
[02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:07.120]   Maybe you can paint the whole picture of that evolutionary,
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:09.920]   that little local pocket of the evolutionary tree.
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:12.260]   How are we related?
[02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:14.200]   What is the common ancestor?
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:15.720]   What are the interesting differences?
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:17.320]   I know I'm asking a million questions,
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:22.320]   but can you paint a map of what are chimps, gorillas,
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:25.160]   and humans, like how we're related
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:27.360]   and what you find fascinating about each?
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:32.720]   - In Africa, straddling the equator,
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:37.280]   there is a strip of rainforest
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:42.280]   that relies on the combination of high temperatures
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:45.120]   and rainfall that you get around the equator.
[02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:50.740]   That rainforest goes into about 22 countries.
[02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:55.120]   And throughout those countries, you have chimpanzees,
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:57.320]   although they've gone extinct in two of them.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:02.760]   In just a fraction of them,
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:04.920]   but it was five countries,
[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:09.920]   you've got gorillas where there are mountains.
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:14.560]   And in one country on the left bank of the Great Congo River
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.880]   you have bonobos.
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:20.840]   So in the African forest, you've got these three African apes,
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:22.140]   the only African apes,
[02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:26.240]   all of which are very similar
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:30.400]   in much of their way of life.
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:33.000]   They walk on their knuckles through the forest,
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.200]   looking for fruit trees and eating herbs
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:38.600]   when they can't find fruits.
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:46.040]   Gorillas represent the oldest chain.
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:49.000]   So about 10 million years ago,
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.760]   maybe as recently as eight million years ago,
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:54.040]   the ancestor of gorillas broke off
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:57.300]   from the ancestor leading to chimps and bonobos and humans.
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:00.800]   So they've probably remained very similar now
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:04.680]   to what they were then.
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:08.960]   They were probably the largest apes
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:11.000]   living in montane areas
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:16.000]   and spending more time eating just herbs, stems,
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:21.200]   not so vitally dependent on fruit
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:26.840]   and living in, if it was like the present,
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:30.620]   groups up to about 50 stable groups
[02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:34.320]   with one alpha male who was in charge.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000]   Gorillas are wonderfully slow and inquisitive
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.400]   compared to chimps and bonobos.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:52.320]   I had the privilege of spending a week or two
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:57.960]   with gorillas at Dianne Fossey's camp
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:00.120]   before she was murdered.
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:05.120]   And I went out with two women, Kelly and Barb,
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:09.320]   to a particular group.
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:14.120]   And there was a young female in the group called Simba.
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:18.280]   And Simba approached us and stared at the two women.
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.920]   And then she came towards me
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:25.920]   and she very deliberately reached out her knuckles
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:28.520]   and touched me on the forehead.
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:34.200]   She was watched in doing this by a young male
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:36.040]   who was quite keen on her.
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:38.000]   And he was called Digit.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.320]   And about five minutes later,
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:44.120]   Digit stood in front of us on the path.
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:46.920]   And Kelly was in front of me.
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:50.200]   And then there was Barb and then there was me.
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:51.840]   And he came charging down the path
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.840]   and he sidestepped around Kelly
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:56.040]   and he sidestepped around Barb.
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:59.560]   And me, he just knocked with his arm
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:02.660]   and sent me flying about five yards into the bushes.
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:04.600]   (Dave laughing)
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:08.880]   And I loved the way that that was a very deliberate response
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:11.960]   and I loved the way that Simba had been so interested in me
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:14.360]   and held my eye.
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:17.000]   Chimps and bonobos never hold your eye,
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.760]   but gorillas really look as though
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:20.000]   they're trying to sort of figure out,
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.440]   what are you thinking about?
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:27.600]   That was a species that goes back
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:30.040]   for something like 10 million years.
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:33.800]   - In that situation, was there a game being played?
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:38.440]   - Well, I mean, I felt that Digit was telling me,
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:40.560]   I don't want you messing with Simba.
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:43.760]   - But was Simba using you?
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:44.840]   - Oh, I see.
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:46.520]   Well, that's a fun idea.
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:48.360]   I don't see why she should be using me,
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:51.200]   but you mean testing how strongly
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:53.240]   Digit was prepared to intervene.
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:54.080]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:56.440]   - Oh, that's come straight out of
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:11:58.320]   a sort of adolescent high school playbook.
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:11:59.800]   - All right, well, that's all.
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:02.720]   - No, no, no, there's nothing wrong with it for that.
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:05.040]   - Yeah, I don't know, I never thought of that,
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:06.840]   and you never know.
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:08.160]   (Luke laughs)
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:09.800]   It's possible.
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:14.160]   - So, yeah, so, okay, so this is an ancient branch
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:17.800]   of the evolutionary tree, this gorilla that led to gorillas.
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:19.200]   - Gorillas.
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:20.720]   So then the next thing that happened
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:23.760]   on the evolutionary tree was six or seven million years ago,
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:28.760]   when you have the line between chimps and bonobos
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:34.160]   on the one hand and humans on the other splitting.
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:36.880]   And basically what happened is that at that point,
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:40.760]   a chimp-like ancestor leaves the forest,
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:45.240]   gets isolated in an area outside the forest and adapts,
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:46.720]   and that becomes the Australopithecines,
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:50.880]   and meanwhile, the chimpanzees and bonobo ancestor
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:52.160]   continues in the forest.
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:57.720]   And later what happens is that one branch of that
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:00.020]   crosses the Congo River and becomes a bonobos.
[02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:02.840]   That was only about 2 million years ago,
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:04.140]   maybe 1 million years ago.
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:07.520]   Now, the chimps that remained in the forest
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:09.760]   throughout this time and occupied all the countries
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:12.520]   across from West to East Africa now,
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:16.000]   again, we assume that they're pretty similar
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.560]   to the ones that live nowadays,
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:21.840]   where there's some variation from West to East.
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:25.840]   And these are animals that live in social communities
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:29.880]   of between say 20 and 200.
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:32.360]   They have a lot of them in one group,
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:35.040]   but they never come together in a single unit.
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:39.960]   They share an area, a community territory,
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:41.800]   and that area is defended by males,
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:43.800]   and within it females wander
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:46.120]   and bring up their young independently.
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:51.120]   And the females are very scared about the possibility
[02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:55.820]   that males will be mean to their infants.
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:58.640]   And in order to avoid them doing that,
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:02.740]   they do their best to mate with every single male
[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:04.700]   in the group multiple times,
[02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:07.460]   as if to give a memory in that male of,
[02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:08.980]   "Yeah, yeah, I reminded you,
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:11.600]   so I'm not gonna be mean to your baby."
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:12.960]   So what's wonderful about chimps?
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:15.220]   Well, as we've spoken about them,
[02:14:15.220 --> 02:14:20.140]   they are creative and amazingly human-like,
[02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:22.820]   but I love the sort of the quiet moments
[02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:24.100]   and here's one.
[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:30.780]   I've got two chimps who are grooming each other
[02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:33.680]   on a day when they are utterly exhausted.
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:37.760]   They've walked 11 kilometers the day before,
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:39.840]   up and down hills.
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:42.180]   And on this particular day,
[02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:44.380]   all they do is they get to one tree
[02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:45.820]   and they eat from that tree.
[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:48.500]   And other than that, they only walk about 100 yards
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:50.340]   and they go back to sleep in the nest
[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:52.500]   in which they woke up.
[02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:53.860]   So they're utterly exhausted
[02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:56.700]   and they're just eating nonstop
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:59.900]   'cause they're trying to recover their energy.
[02:14:59.900 --> 02:15:02.860]   And this is Hugh and Charlie.
[02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:04.420]   And we think they were probably brothers,
[02:15:04.420 --> 02:15:06.820]   though we never actually got the genetic evidence
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:08.540]   to prove it.
[02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:11.660]   Well, I never remember now who it is,
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:16.660]   but let's say that they both come down from the tree
[02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:22.060]   and they're both carrying branches of the food
[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:25.100]   or actually seeds from these branches.
[02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:28.260]   They're both engaged even in the midday sun
[02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:29.820]   when they want to come down
[02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:33.160]   and unshade themselves for a bit on the ground.
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:34.900]   They're still eating,
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:38.180]   but then Charlie finishes his branch
[02:15:38.180 --> 02:15:41.180]   and he starts grooming Hugh.
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:47.460]   And Hugh continues eating from his branch.
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:51.580]   Charlie eventually gets bored with this
[02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:55.380]   after a few minutes and he reaches out
[02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:58.980]   and he lifts the branch from which Hugh
[02:15:58.980 --> 02:16:03.060]   is still taking seeds and puts it over his head
[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:05.100]   and puts it behind his back
[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:07.620]   as far as possible away from Hugh.
[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:10.660]   Hugh doesn't do anything.
[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:12.340]   He just finishes his mouthful
[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:15.020]   and then he turns to Charlie and grooms him.
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:16.700]   So this very polite way of saying,
[02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:19.820]   "Will you groom me please?" has worked.
[02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:24.820]   Then Hugh grooms around Charlie's back
[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:28.380]   and around to the right side
[02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.060]   and then down his arm to a point
[02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:33.060]   where he can reach the branch again.
[02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:36.140]   And then he picks up the branch and continues.
[02:16:36.140 --> 02:16:37.220]   - Nonchalantly.
[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:38.140]   - Right. - Yeah.
[02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:39.820]   - So in other words,
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:42.020]   a very sort of simple little strategy,
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:43.900]   but it just shows the courtesy
[02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:47.060]   with which they can treat each other.
[02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:49.340]   And the days I love with chimps,
[02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:50.460]   so when you see that sort of thing,
[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:52.660]   or when you see mothers just lying
[02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:55.220]   in a sunlit patch in the forest
[02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:58.140]   with their babies bouncing on top of them,
[02:16:58.140 --> 02:17:01.460]   just having a wonderful, peaceful time.
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:04.460]   And that's what most of their lives are like.
[02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:09.620]   So chimpanzees are the species
[02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:11.900]   that kind of unites the rest of the apes
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:14.780]   because a gorilla is in many ways
[02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:16.500]   just a big version of a chimpanzee.
[02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:19.100]   If you can sort of engineer a chimpanzee
[02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:20.220]   in your mind to be bigger,
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:22.540]   it basically turns into a gorilla.
[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:26.460]   And then bonobos on the left bank of the Congo River
[02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:32.020]   are like a domesticated form of a chimpanzee,
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:33.580]   but obviously humans didn't domesticate them,
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:35.260]   so they're self-domesticated.
[02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:37.020]   They are less aggressive
[02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:39.780]   and they show all the marks of domestication
[02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:43.140]   that domestication animals do compared to wild animals
[02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:44.660]   in their bones.
[02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:47.540]   So they have reduced differences between males and females
[02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:49.100]   in which the males are more like females,
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:50.180]   they have smaller brains,
[02:17:50.180 --> 02:17:52.980]   they have shorter faces,
[02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:55.580]   smaller teeth and smaller bodies.
[02:17:55.580 --> 02:17:57.740]   All the things that domesticated animals show.
[02:17:57.740 --> 02:18:01.300]   And bonobos live in this environment
[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:05.460]   in a strikingly peaceful way compared to the chimpanzees.
[02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:07.660]   There's no indication
[02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:10.580]   that they will have these aggressive kills
[02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:12.500]   and enough data now to show
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:13.980]   that there's a statistical difference
[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:16.460]   in the frequency at which it would happen.
[02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:21.460]   And bonobos are famously erotic.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:26.660]   The females have enlarged sexual parts,
[02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:30.340]   which swell to a particularly large size
[02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:33.740]   compared to the female chimpanzees.
[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:37.420]   And the females have a lot of interactions
[02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:40.180]   with each other in which they excitedly
[02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:42.060]   rub their clitorises together
[02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:45.340]   and appear to have orgasms.
[02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:47.580]   And these occur in the context
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:52.420]   of some kind of social tension.
[02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:53.900]   And they sometimes happen before,
[02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:55.780]   sometimes happen after the social tension,
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:59.460]   and they seem to be devices, these interactions,
[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:02.300]   for ensuring that everyone's friends
[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:03.940]   and reducing the chances
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:05.540]   that they're actually going to get into a fight.
[02:19:05.540 --> 02:19:08.660]   - So it's a kind of a conflict resolution
[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:13.100]   through sex or some kind of pleasurable sexual experience.
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:15.540]   - Well, it's often characterised as make love, not war.
[02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:17.380]   That's right. - Make love, not war.
[02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:19.100]   Okay.
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:22.940]   You mentioned to me offline
[02:19:22.940 --> 02:19:25.580]   that you have a deep love for nature.
[02:19:25.580 --> 02:19:28.380]   If we look at the world today,
[02:19:28.380 --> 02:19:34.180]   how can we ensure that the beautiful parts of nature
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:39.660]   remain a big part of our lives as human beings
[02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:41.060]   in the way we think about it,
[02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:46.060]   in the way we also keep it around, preserve it?
[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:47.940]   You know, we keep it part of our minds
[02:19:47.940 --> 02:19:49.060]   and part of our world.
[02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:55.100]   - It's a very difficult question
[02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:58.180]   because every time there is a conflict
[02:19:58.180 --> 02:20:02.180]   between conservation of a natural habitat
[02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:07.100]   and allowing people to get that little bit of extra food
[02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:08.420]   for their babies,
[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:13.100]   then naturally the tendency is for the humans to win.
[02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:17.660]   So we have this steady erosion
[02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:22.220]   in the face of tremendous efforts to conserve nature.
[02:20:22.220 --> 02:20:25.980]   We have a continuing steady erosion of habitats
[02:20:25.980 --> 02:20:27.980]   and all the species,
[02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:30.860]   and the numbers are always in the wrong direction.
[02:20:31.740 --> 02:20:34.620]   Occasionally you get sort of wonderful little examples
[02:20:34.620 --> 02:20:36.500]   of something being saved,
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:39.340]   but the overall trend is clear.
[02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:43.060]   And it's very difficult to see how one can ever escape that
[02:20:43.060 --> 02:20:45.260]   because it's not human.
[02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:49.380]   Now that we are essentially a single tribe
[02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:53.740]   to want to save an elephant,
[02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:56.260]   if it means killing 20 humans.
[02:20:57.660 --> 02:21:02.260]   So I think the only way in which we can really conserve
[02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:06.580]   is if we put tremendous effort
[02:21:06.580 --> 02:21:11.580]   into conserving the very best representative areas of nature.
[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:18.900]   Often this will be the national parks that already exist.
[02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:22.740]   And what we have to do is to make them so valuable
[02:21:22.740 --> 02:21:26.620]   that actually it is worth it in terms of human survival
[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:29.060]   to be able to keep those sorts of places.
[02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:33.820]   And that's the attitude that my colleagues and I
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:34.860]   have taken in Uganda,
[02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:39.860]   where we want to keep the Kibale National Park alive,
[02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:42.540]   which has got the largest population of chimpanzees
[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:45.380]   in Uganda, and it's got elephants and wonderful birds
[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:47.900]   and wonderful butterflies and wonderful plants and so on,
[02:21:47.900 --> 02:21:52.340]   and visitors, and lots and lots of visitors.
[02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:55.780]   It may be that we're going to have to have huge increases
[02:21:55.780 --> 02:21:59.780]   in the amount of charges that you pay for ecotourism,
[02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:03.460]   and you need to make sure that ecotourism is done right.
[02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:07.260]   In other places, you will keep nature there
[02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:12.260]   because it's useful for maintaining the climate,
[02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:14.680]   bringing rain.
[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:18.860]   Maybe you can in some places
[02:22:18.860 --> 02:22:25.500]   convince people of the sheer sort of aesthetics
[02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:30.460]   of keeping nature that even over the long-term,
[02:22:30.460 --> 02:22:35.460]   presidents whose job it is to look for the future
[02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:38.420]   of the country will be persuaded
[02:22:38.420 --> 02:22:41.440]   that you can do it for purely aesthetic reasons.
[02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:46.440]   But overall, what is required is for people
[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:52.460]   in the rich countries to do much more investment
[02:22:52.460 --> 02:22:57.460]   than they have so far in maintaining both the natural places
[02:22:57.460 --> 02:23:02.900]   in their own countries and in the tropics.
[02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:04.260]   And if you look at Africa,
[02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:10.300]   the population trends are that Nigeria
[02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:13.860]   may become the most populous country in the world,
[02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:15.940]   I think, within a century.
[02:23:15.940 --> 02:23:21.060]   The future of African habitats,
[02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:23.300]   it's clear what's gonna happen in general.
[02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:25.380]   There's gonna be a huge conversion
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:26.840]   towards agricultural land.
[02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:33.460]   I heard Ed Wilson speak years ago
[02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:37.940]   about the prospect of the entire globe
[02:23:37.940 --> 02:23:41.220]   being turned into a single human feedlot.
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:46.020]   It's gonna take a lot to avoid that.
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:51.020]   He is out there calling for half the growth
[02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:54.380]   of the earth to be devoted to nature.
[02:23:54.380 --> 02:23:57.620]   It's incredibly ambitious and incredibly optimistic.
[02:23:57.620 --> 02:24:01.300]   But unless you have really exciting goals,
[02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:03.000]   probably nothing will be achieved.
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:07.260]   - Yeah, I mean, there's something to me,
[02:24:07.260 --> 02:24:09.620]   like when I visit New York and I see Central Park
[02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:11.780]   and somehow constructed a situation
[02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:14.500]   where you preserve this park in the middle,
[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:17.940]   probably some of the most expensive land in the world.
[02:24:17.940 --> 02:24:19.940]   The fact that that's possible gives me hope
[02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:21.940]   that you can do this kind of preservation
[02:24:21.940 --> 02:24:23.160]   at a global scale.
[02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:26.060]   Perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons
[02:24:26.060 --> 02:24:29.140]   of just valuing the beauty
[02:24:29.140 --> 02:24:32.340]   and just respecting our origins
[02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:35.500]   of having come from the earth.
[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:39.580]   - We are so incredibly lucky to have chimpanzees,
[02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:43.540]   bonobos, and gorillas as our close relatives
[02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:44.580]   still living on the earth.
[02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:45.940]   You know, we're unlucky that we don't have
[02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:48.380]   Australopithecines and other species of homo,
[02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:49.940]   but we're still lucky to have those
[02:24:49.940 --> 02:24:52.220]   because they are incredibly closely related to us
[02:24:52.220 --> 02:24:54.540]   compared to what most animals have.
[02:24:54.540 --> 02:24:55.500]   You know, there are many animals
[02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:59.060]   that don't have any close relatives to them on the earth,
[02:24:59.060 --> 02:25:01.340]   but not only are they relatively close,
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:04.100]   but they teach us so much about ourselves.
[02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:07.220]   You know, the similarities between them and ourselves
[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:09.780]   raise questions that we can then test
[02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:14.180]   about the extent to which our own behavioral propensities
[02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:17.100]   are derived from the same evolutionary stock
[02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:19.300]   as in those great apes.
[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:21.140]   Well, how much is that worth?
[02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:23.180]   You know, I mean, we could spend billions
[02:25:23.180 --> 02:25:28.180]   going to the Mars to find evidence of bacteria there,
[02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:30.700]   and that's fascinating too,
[02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:33.460]   but we should be spending billions on this earth
[02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:36.980]   in order to make sure that we have,
[02:25:36.980 --> 02:25:40.180]   I don't know how to say it, you know,
[02:25:40.180 --> 02:25:43.620]   substantial representative populations
[02:25:43.620 --> 02:25:45.420]   of these close relatives.
[02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:46.980]   - Yeah, that we can meet.
[02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:49.420]   - There's something like space tourism.
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:53.380]   When you go out into space and you look back down on earth,
[02:25:53.380 --> 02:25:57.260]   that's to a lot of people, including myself, is worth a lot.
[02:25:57.260 --> 02:25:59.660]   But why is that worth a lot?
[02:25:59.660 --> 02:26:04.660]   Is because it's humbling and beautiful
[02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:10.340]   in the same way that meeting our close evolutionary relatives
[02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:13.300]   is humbling and beautiful.
[02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:17.860]   Just to know that this is what we come from.
[02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:19.340]   This is who we are.
[02:26:19.340 --> 02:26:21.580]   Not just for the understanding or the science of it,
[02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:23.660]   but just like something about just the beauty
[02:26:23.660 --> 02:26:24.940]   of witnessing this.
[02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:30.940]   And again, it's both humbling and empowering
[02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:34.640]   that this place is fragile and we're damn lucky to be here.
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:37.700]   - Yes, and unfortunately,
[02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:40.420]   the problems are incredibly difficult to solve
[02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:42.140]   and there is no one solver.
[02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:44.660]   You know, it has to happen from a network
[02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:47.780]   of potentially cooperating people.
[02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:49.780]   But I mean, you're so right about it being daunting
[02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:52.380]   to think about what it looks like from space.
[02:26:52.380 --> 02:26:55.380]   And I love the view that Herman Muller expressed
[02:26:55.380 --> 02:26:58.980]   of being able to go out from space.
[02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:02.180]   And he said, "The whole of life would look like
[02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:04.440]   "a kind of rust on the planet."
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:06.420]   (laughing)
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:08.440]   - Yeah, so the aliens were to visit.
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:10.260]   I'm not sure they would notice the life.
[02:27:10.260 --> 02:27:15.260]   They would probably notice the trees or ocean.
[02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:17.500]   It's a kind of rust.
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:21.460]   But let me ask the big, ridiculous, philosophical question.
[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:23.740]   What is the meaning of this rust?
[02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:26.280]   What do you think is the meaning of life on Earth?
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:28.940]   What is the meaning of our human, intelligent life?
[02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:32.140]   - Well, I think it's very clear
[02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:35.860]   that we have an evolutionary story
[02:27:35.860 --> 02:27:40.860]   that is only getting challenged around the edges.
[02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:44.820]   We have a very clear understanding of the evolution of life.
[02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:49.820]   And the meaning is, we are here as a consequence
[02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:53.340]   of materialistic processes
[02:27:53.340 --> 02:27:59.380]   that began, in our sense,
[02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:03.060]   with the establishment of the Earth
[02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:04.900]   four and a half billion years ago, whatever it was,
[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:08.860]   and then water and oxygen and so on.
[02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:13.140]   And we are the astonishing consequence
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:21.220]   of the evolution of cells and multicellular organisms.
[02:28:21.220 --> 02:28:27.500]   The word random is the wrong word to use
[02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:29.400]   unless you understand what it means.
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:33.740]   It didn't happen by chance,
[02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:35.780]   but a lot of random events had to happen
[02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:37.660]   to make this possible.
[02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:39.380]   And those random events, of course,
[02:28:39.380 --> 02:28:42.380]   are the production of appropriate mutations.
[02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:48.220]   But the meaning of life is, there is no meaning.
[02:28:48.220 --> 02:28:53.980]   The really big mystery of life is, why is there a universe?
[02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:57.700]   - And that same why propagates itself
[02:28:57.700 --> 02:29:01.340]   through the whole of it, through the whole process of it
[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:03.980]   for the emergence of planets, the emergence,
[02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:08.980]   first of all, of galaxies, of star systems, of planets,
[02:29:08.980 --> 02:29:12.300]   of the proteins required to construct
[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:15.180]   the single-cell organisms, and the single-cell organism
[02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:19.500]   becoming complex organisms, and some of the clever fish
[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:23.100]   crawling out onto the land and the whole of it.
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:27.460]   And then there's fire, some clever guy or lady
[02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:29.900]   invented fire, and then now here we are.
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:34.460]   It just does seem, speaking as a human,
[02:29:34.460 --> 02:29:36.300]   kind of special that we're able to reflect
[02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:38.260]   on the whole thing, where the whole--
[02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:40.060]   - Wonderful story, so much more interesting
[02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:42.180]   than the stories produced by religion.
[02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:44.420]   - (laughs) Yeah, it is beautiful,
[02:29:44.420 --> 02:29:46.500]   but it just seems special that us humans
[02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:51.060]   are able to write religions and construct stories.
[02:29:51.060 --> 02:29:54.100]   - Yeah, right. - And also do science.
[02:29:54.100 --> 02:29:58.400]   That seems kind of amazing.
[02:29:58.400 --> 02:30:03.400]   It seems like the universe is such
[02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:08.220]   that it creates beings like us
[02:30:08.220 --> 02:30:10.960]   that are able to investigate it.
[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:16.700]   And that's why there's this longing for a why.
[02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:20.860]   That's just, that's such a beautiful little pocket
[02:30:20.860 --> 02:30:23.280]   of complexity created by the universe.
[02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:27.380]   It seems like there should be a why,
[02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:29.700]   but maybe there's just an infinite number of universes,
[02:30:29.700 --> 02:30:33.960]   and this is the one that led to this particular
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:35.260]   set of humans. - Even without
[02:30:35.260 --> 02:30:36.460]   an infinite number of universes,
[02:30:36.460 --> 02:30:38.980]   I bet there's an infinite number of intelligent beings.
[02:30:38.980 --> 02:30:40.900]   - Throughout this universe. - Yeah.
[02:30:40.900 --> 02:30:43.020]   Now that we know how many planets
[02:30:43.020 --> 02:30:44.820]   have the right sort of conditions,
[02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:48.380]   which is what, I can't remember, a lot.
[02:30:48.380 --> 02:30:50.640]   Some significant percentage of all planets.
[02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:55.580]   Then there are apparently billions of planets,
[02:30:55.580 --> 02:30:58.780]   and there's every, I mean,
[02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:00.380]   things happen so quickly on Earth.
[02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:03.060]   Once you got water, then you got life,
[02:31:03.060 --> 02:31:08.060]   and it did not take long for life to evolve
[02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:09.980]   in the big scheme of things.
[02:31:09.980 --> 02:31:12.260]   - And if you think, you look out there,
[02:31:12.260 --> 02:31:14.700]   say there's a nearly infinite number
[02:31:14.700 --> 02:31:16.620]   of intelligent civilizations,
[02:31:16.620 --> 02:31:18.520]   one dimension you could look at
[02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:21.780]   is the proclivity to violence they have.
[02:31:21.780 --> 02:31:25.820]   And it's interesting to think what level of violence
[02:31:25.820 --> 02:31:30.820]   is useful for extending the life of a civilization.
[02:31:30.820 --> 02:31:34.020]   So we have a particular set of violence in our history.
[02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:38.340]   Maybe being too peaceful is a problem in the early days.
[02:31:38.340 --> 02:31:42.220]   Maybe being too violent, quite obviously, is a problem.
[02:31:42.220 --> 02:31:43.440]   So you look at viruses.
[02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:47.220]   What kind of viruses on Earth propagate and succeed?
[02:31:47.220 --> 02:31:50.060]   If you're too deadly, that's a big problem.
[02:31:50.060 --> 02:31:52.720]   If you're not deadly enough, that's also a problem.
[02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:56.180]   So that is a fascinating exploration of--
[02:31:56.180 --> 02:31:57.820]   - I don't see any evidence.
[02:31:57.820 --> 02:31:59.300]   I don't see where you're coming from
[02:31:59.300 --> 02:32:02.260]   when you say that being too peaceful is a problem.
[02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:06.020]   - Well, because, so I'll say it this way.
[02:32:06.020 --> 02:32:11.020]   Death is a way to get rid of suboptimal solutions.
[02:32:11.020 --> 02:32:14.020]   So violence--
[02:32:14.020 --> 02:32:16.220]   - But there's lots of ways to die without violence.
[02:32:16.220 --> 02:32:17.100]   - Right.
[02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:19.580]   To me, death in itself is violence.
[02:32:19.580 --> 02:32:23.380]   And you can, I mean, a lot of people that talk about,
[02:32:23.380 --> 02:32:25.900]   for example, longevity and disease
[02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:26.740]   and all that kind of stuff,
[02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:31.340]   they see death is a, this is the way they talk about it.
[02:32:31.340 --> 02:32:33.740]   And it's interesting to philosophically think of it that way.
[02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:37.660]   It's just, death is, it's like mass murder that's happening.
[02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:39.800]   And it's like people that try to,
[02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:42.940]   from a biological perspective, help extend life,
[02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:47.860]   they see that you're helping the most,
[02:32:47.860 --> 02:32:51.140]   the biggest atrocity in the history of human civilization
[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:56.140]   from their perspective is not allocating all our resources
[02:32:56.140 --> 02:32:59.520]   to solving death, right?
[02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:02.040]   Because death is a kind of violence.
[02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:04.820]   It is a kind of murder that we're allowing
[02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:06.900]   to be committed on us by nature.
[02:33:06.900 --> 02:33:10.940]   And so the flip side of that is death makes way
[02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:14.100]   for new life, for new ideas.
[02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:14.940]   And so that's--
[02:33:14.940 --> 02:33:16.500]   - Yes, but that's got nothing to do
[02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:18.940]   with peace versus war.
[02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:20.380]   You know, I mean, you have animals
[02:33:20.380 --> 02:33:21.760]   that are very, very peaceful,
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:25.100]   but they evolve just in the same way as other animals do.
[02:33:25.100 --> 02:33:28.560]   They just don't do it with death caused by violence.
[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:31.180]   And violent death is premature death, surely.
[02:33:31.180 --> 02:33:33.660]   I mean, I don't mind about people dying.
[02:33:33.660 --> 02:33:37.260]   You know, what I mind about is people dying
[02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:40.940]   in their youth, middle age.
[02:33:40.940 --> 02:33:42.020]   - Prematurely.
[02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:44.940]   But some people would say all death is premature.
[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:46.660]   It certainly feels that way.
[02:33:46.660 --> 02:33:49.780]   It's died too soon.
[02:33:49.780 --> 02:33:52.220]   Anyone who's ever died, died too soon.
[02:33:52.220 --> 02:33:55.420]   - Yeah, well, I mean, if we can become like sequoias
[02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:58.500]   and live for hundreds of years or thousands of years,
[02:33:58.500 --> 02:33:59.340]   that'd be great.
[02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:02.580]   - Do you ponder your own mortality?
[02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:04.140]   Are you afraid of death?
[02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:05.940]   - I don't think I'm afraid of it.
[02:34:05.940 --> 02:34:08.740]   You know, I'm reconciled to the fact it's gonna happen.
[02:34:08.740 --> 02:34:13.900]   I just feel frustrated because I enjoy life, you know,
[02:34:13.900 --> 02:34:17.060]   and I don't want to leave the party.
[02:34:17.060 --> 02:34:22.140]   - Yeah, it's kind of a fun party.
[02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:25.540]   I don't wanna leave the party either.
[02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:28.660]   So however we got here, we made one heck of an awesome party
[02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:29.660]   and you're right.
[02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:33.700]   Having a party with a little bit less violence in it
[02:34:33.700 --> 02:34:36.100]   is an even more fun party.
[02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:38.500]   Richard, I'm deeply honored that you spent time
[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:39.340]   with me today.
[02:34:39.340 --> 02:34:40.660]   Your work is amazing.
[02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:43.780]   It includes some of the deepest thinking
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:46.900]   about our human history and the nature
[02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:47.940]   of human civilization.
[02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:50.580]   So again, thank you so much for talking today.
[02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:51.460]   It's an honor.
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:52.540]   - No, thanks for your great questions.
[02:34:52.540 --> 02:34:54.580]   It was a really fun conversation.
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:56.460]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:34:56.460 --> 02:34:58.380]   with Richard Frangham.
[02:34:58.380 --> 02:34:59.540]   To support this podcast,

[02:35:02.420 --> 02:35:05.900]   And now let me leave you with some words from Jane Goodall.
[02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:09.180]   The greatest danger to our future is apathy.
[02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:13.220]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:15.820]   (upbeat music)
[02:35:15.820 --> 02:35:18.420]   (upbeat music)
