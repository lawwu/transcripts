[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   All right, so let's get into it a little bit.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.360]   So we have master of change.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.760]   Let's start with some motivating premise.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.920]   So I want to talk about the narrative of stability.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.920]   What is the narrative of stability?
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.840]   Why is it so popular in our culture?
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.700]   And why might that be a problem?
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.840]   - Well, I first had the idea to really wrestle
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.060]   with the idea of change early on in the pandemic,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.300]   when every large publication was running stories
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.000]   about when we're going to get back to normal.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.660]   And I remember thinking that I doubt we're ever
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.960]   going to get back to normal.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.300]   And why is that even the goal to get back to normal?
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.200]   This was this enormous societal shift.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.920]   And I started researching and realized that so much
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.460]   of our thinking on change traces itself back
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.320]   to this concept called homeostasis,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.000]   which was developed in the mid 1800s.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.900]   And it was a model to describe how the body responds
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.320]   to stressors.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.400]   And homeostasis says that there is order and stability,
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.000]   then there's some sort of disorder event,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.940]   and then a healthy system gets back to stability,
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.640]   gets back to stability.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.600]   - And this was like the human body is what they were looking
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.980]   at as the example.
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.820]   - That's right.
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.300]   - Though this term then became more general, I suppose.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.900]   Ecosystems could be homeostatic, mechanical systems.
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.340]   Google anything relating to change.
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.400]   I want to change my behavior, I want to quit smoking,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.860]   I want to start exercising, I want to change a new job.
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.400]   And it's always about fighting your body's natural
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.260]   resistance to change, or fighting your mind's
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.100]   natural resistance to change.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.840]   And homeostasis was the guiding intellectual theory
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.900]   under change for 150 years.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.740]   But more recently, researchers, again, starting
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.540]   in the biology life sciences community,
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.660]   decided that while homeostasis represents change
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.440]   in a couple very narrow examples,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.100]   broadly speaking, that's not actually
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.780]   what healthy systems do.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.620]   - How interesting.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.460]   - After disorder, healthy systems return to stability,
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.780]   but that stability is always somewhere new.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.500]   So they don't go back to where they were,
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.140]   they strive for stability somewhere new.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.020]   - So homeostasis, the original target,
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.380]   this was talking about the human body, I suppose,
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.640]   where you really do need to return to some sort of baseline
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.460]   because the states of heightened, I don't know,
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.920]   hormonal arousal or something like this.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.220]   You couldn't be in that state all the time,
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.060]   you would have a stroke or a heart attack.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.800]   But once they applied this term to other systems,
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.880]   that's where the mistake was.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.020]   Actually, other systems don't return back
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.180]   to some sort of platonic baseline.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.220]   So what you're saying, so the human body might do that
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.900]   from a biochemical perspective, but other systems
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.100]   that aren't just a human body don't necessarily.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.940]   - That's right.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.080]   And even the human body, so in very narrow examples,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.200]   so the example of a fever.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.820]   So you run it somewhere between 97 to 99 degrees,
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.360]   it's like the middle of the bell curve.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.560]   And you have a fever and your temperature spikes to 101
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.580]   and then it gets back to where it was.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.900]   That is homeostatic regulation working.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.900]   However, you train your muscles and you break down tissue.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.620]   That tissue repairs and it gets back to stability,
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.380]   but it becomes stronger, that stability is somewhere new.
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.120]   You go through psychological therapy
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.060]   and you break down old patterns and your brain rewires,
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.820]   but it ends up somewhere new.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.100]   So even within the human body and the human brain,
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.740]   allostasis turns out to be a much more accurate
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.980]   representative model of change in 99% of cases.
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.820]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.620]   So homeostasis was not just the body where it was accurate,
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.060]   but very specific systems in the body,
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.060]   like the core temperature.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.880]   - That's right.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.720]   - Yeah, interesting.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.240]   - So the intellectual underpinnings of allostasis,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.180]   like homeostasis, also come out of medicine.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.060]   So the term was coined by a neuroscientist
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.220]   and it was kind of made its scientific debut
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.340]   in the late '80s and early '90s
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.700]   in many medical and scientific journals
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.660]   is a new way to conceptualize the brain.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.540]   Because we used to think that the brain was more static
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.160]   and that when there was a change to the brain
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.080]   and it was disrupted, it had to go back to where it was.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.500]   And now we know that the brain
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.580]   is constantly rewiring itself.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.820]   The body, the immune system, it fights an illness, right?
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.620]   There's order, then there's this disorder event, an illness,
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.980]   and then it goes back to order,
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.140]   but that order's somewhere new with antibodies.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.500]   - Right, and I know too much about the immune system
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.340]   because of COVID.
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.820]   And my audience knows about the rabbit hole I went down,
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.380]   so don't get me started about CD4
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.260]   versus CD8 T cell receptors.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.620]   But yes, our immune system is different now
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.460]   than it was pre-COVID.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.460]   It's different now than it was
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.340]   pre the last sickness we got from our kid,
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.500]   which was a week ago or something like that.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.780]   - Right, so for the longest time,
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.020]   this is like to your original question,
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.860]   we've done a good job unpacking it.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.420]   The model of change was a system has stability at X,
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.100]   there's some kind of disorder event, a change,
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.940]   and then the system gets back to stability at X.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.460]   But what the research now shows
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.300]   is that a healthy, fluid, thriving system
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.920]   has stability at X, there's some sort of change.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.980]   That system, after the change, craves stability,
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.900]   but that stability is at Y or Z.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.700]   It's always at somewhere new.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.500]   - Yeah, so there's a different whatever minimas or maximums
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.820]   in this landscape of configurations that have stability.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.020]   So you get dislodged from one
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.980]   because of some sort of disruptive event,
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.940]   you're probably now much closer to a different configuration.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.900]   The nearest optimal stable configuration
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.740]   could be quite different.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.860]   - Exactly, and trying to go back to where you were
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.660]   often prolongs that distress
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.740]   instead of getting moving somewhere closer
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.740]   to where you now are.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.900]   - So how much when it comes to human psychology,
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.380]   so now we're thinking about how you or I
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.500]   might think about ourselves and our narrative
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.080]   when there's a change,
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.620]   how much then is our dislike as humans of change
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.940]   and our need to return back,
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.300]   how much of that is some sort of cultural imbibing
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.820]   of this notion that was out there in the ether,
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.380]   and how much of this is also just the way
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.800]   we're wired as humans, that change represents,
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.080]   I don't know, danger and there's familiarity.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.540]   What comes to play when it's our own psychology?
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.860]   - Yeah, it's a great question, Cal,
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.560]   and I think that the majority of this is actually cultural.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.980]   And there's some interesting research that we can lean on
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.420]   because when you look at cross-cultural studies
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.700]   of how people respond to change,
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.240]   what you find is that in Eastern cultures
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.980]   where homeostasis isn't a known concept,
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.460]   people have much better relationships with change.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.440]   They don't resist it, they don't deny it,
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.020]   they don't get scared by it, they actually embrace it.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.940]   Something else that's really interesting
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.220]   is that homeostasis had us think of change
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.580]   as these acute events that happen to us.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.380]   But when you step back and you think about it,
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.920]   all of life is change.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.520]   Change is not an acute event, it is an ongoing process.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.140]   Aging is change.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.160]   Health is change.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.240]   You think about an EKG, the last thing
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.560]   that you wanna see is a straight line.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.200]   That is literally death.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.400]   So we're constantly undergoing these cycles
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.480]   of order, disorder, and reorder,
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.360]   and I think the biggest mindset flip that we can make
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.020]   to have a much better relationship with change
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.720]   is to stop thinking about it as something
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.500]   that happens to us and start thinking about it
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   as an ongoing conversation that we're always a part of.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.340]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.760]   The cross-cultural stuff is interesting too.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.700]   So is it Western?
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.540]   - Correct.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.360]   - Is it Western in general?
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.280]   Not just American, but sort of a Western culture thing.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.120]   - Exactly.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.320]   - I see, but is the fact that I haven't left
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.360]   the college campus since I turned 18
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.000]   a sign that I'm just hopelessly resistant to change?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.680]   I will be a student for, I'm never gonna leave school.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.740]   That's it, I never wanna change again.
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.500]   - Yes, and what I would argue is that the college campus
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.960]   has changed quite a bit in the last 30 years.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.360]   - That's true, I try to avoid change.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.440]   - And it came for you anyways.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.560]   There's no escaping.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.440]   - Yeah, it came for me anyways.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.400]   Okay, that's very interesting.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.240]   So you're saying there are changes that we're used to.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.000]   We age, different things, we're used to it.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.560]   My youngest kid, for example, today,
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.940]   I brought him to his last day of the preschool
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.560]   that all three of our kids went.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.680]   So that's like eight years of having kids in this preschool.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.040]   That's change, and that's gonna happen.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.240]   Then they'll leave elementary school,
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.960]   and then they'll leave high school.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.720]   But when it comes to certain types of events,
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.840]   we're just, for whatever reason,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.060]   we categorize them as unacceptable,
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.800]   or change is not a response.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.360]   I guess, what, like a job event, a health event,
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.840]   I don't know what type of things,
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.760]   what type of circumstances, but for whatever reason,
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.160]   there's a particular, what is the band,
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.440]   I guess I should say, what is the band of changes,
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.680]   the categories of changes that, at least in Western culture,
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.440]   we tend to think of as unbearable?
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.200]   - Yeah, I think that they tend to revolve
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.000]   around major life transitions.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.880]   So relationships, jobs, health,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.440]   those are probably the big categories.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.360]   What's fascinating is that research shows
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.520]   that the average adult goes through 36
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.760]   major life transitions.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.080]   And again, we think of change as like this abnormal event,
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.680]   yet we're experiencing a big change every two years.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.240]   And common examples are you get married, you get divorced,
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.280]   you start a job, you end a job, you change jobs,
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.640]   you retire, your kids start school, your kids leave school,
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.100]   you're an empty nester, you relocate your geography,
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.520]   you publish a book, you have a book flop,
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.240]   all of these things.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.520]   And what's interesting too is that it's not just bad change
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.360]   that throws us for a loop, it's all change.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   There's research that shows that after positive events,
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.320]   people often experience a lot of stress.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.360]   - Yeah, that I know from experience.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.240]   Yeah, something goes well, you're like, oh my God,
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.560]   so I have to do these other things now,
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.720]   or these expectations are higher.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.120]   So you talked about, in the book,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.800]   you talked about early on, you went through
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.840]   a bunch of these all at once, right around the time
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.440]   you were conceiving the book with your professional
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.360]   situation, your geographic location, et cetera.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.680]   Maybe we should set the stage with that,
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.280]   because then we can use you as a case study
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.320]   once we get to the right way to think about change.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.480]   - Yeah, so that's right.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.000]   When I was in the process of coming up with this idea
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   for the book and writing the book, COVID,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.440]   which was a change that just about everyone
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.200]   experienced collectively, though many of us
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.960]   experienced it differently, so there was the pandemic.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.240]   My family moved from Northern California
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.120]   to Asheville, North Carolina, a big, thriving
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.040]   West Coast city to a small, mid-Atlantic mountain town.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:46.480]   I was basically, maybe told is too harsh,
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.000]   but a sport that had been a huge part of my identity,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.400]   running, for the last 15 years.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.240]   I was told I had a pretty serious condition in my calf
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.400]   that would probably be the end of my running career,
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.160]   and I would need major orthopedic surgery on my leg.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.040]   Within the last five years, I had the birth
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.320]   of my first two children.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.520]   A very painful family estrangement happened
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.520]   in my family of origin, and I had my first solo book
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.880]   that was published and did quite well,
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.680]   which allowed me to stop doing all of my contract work
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.240]   that I had been doing as a coach.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.920]   So I started my own private community coaching practice,
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.560]   and this is all within five years,
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.320]   and if you take Theo, my oldest, out of it,
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.120]   this is all within two and a half years.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   - So you were thinking about exactly this topic,
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.520]   but was it chicken or egg?
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.920]   So was it all of these changes that got you thinking,
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.400]   how do we think about change?
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.080]   Why is this, I need to think about this,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.800]   I need to up my game, or was it serendipitous?
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.120]   You were thinking about change,
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.040]   and then had an immediate opportunity
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.600]   to chest out your theories.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.400]   - I mean, you know this as well as me, right?
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.920]   We write the books that we wanna read ourselves.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.480]   So I think that it's a little bit of both,
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.040]   and what really captured it for me is,
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.480]   whether it's the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.120]   or The Economist or The Atlantic,
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.280]   just during COVID, every week, I saw,
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.140]   when are sports gonna get back to normal?
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.520]   When is work gonna get back to normal?
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.640]   When is family holidays gonna get back to normal?
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   And I'm thinking, like, never.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.320]   Like, and why should we want to get back to normal?
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.240]   - Yeah, well, let me ask you about that,
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.240]   'cause I don't know if this is an example,
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.640]   I think it's relevant to your theory,
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.480]   'cause it's something I noticed
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.800]   about exactly that phenomenon.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.520]   And I don't know if you or I have talked about this before,
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.320]   but I've certainly brought it up before.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.520]   I noticed during that period of COVID,
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.520]   there was this split.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.560]   So there were the people that,
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.400]   when are we gonna get back to normal,
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.800]   when are we gonna get back to normal?
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.560]   And things weren't going back to normal right away.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.000]   And that led to certain sort of maladapted responses,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.320]   so either that could lead to a retreat into substance abuse
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.540]   or into sort of weirdly, like, hardcore,
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.040]   everything is a microchip and a conspiracy,
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.900]   just trying to deal with that.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.880]   There were certain groups I saw that really handled it well,
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.100]   and there was no big issue.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.760]   And one group I saw that, for whatever reason,
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.080]   this is gonna sound random,
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.480]   was Navy SEALs who have podcasts.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.920]   There was a few different Navy SEALs,
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.360]   either I know or I know of their podcasts.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.260]   I'm thinking of, like, Mark Devine,
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.160]   I'm thinking of Jocko Willink, ex-Navy SEALs.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.420]   And I remember listening to them in this period,
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.720]   and they're very chill,
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.160]   but also very just accepting of the circumstances.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.600]   Okay, this is different, let's refactor.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.360]   And I was wondering, maybe this was something
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.920]   that through that type of training,
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.800]   you get really used to the idea that, whatever,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.320]   you're on an op and all sorts of stuff is gonna go wrong
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.160]   or not what you expected.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.040]   Our whole training, if you're in the special forces,
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.160]   was, well, how do you adapt to the situation on the ground?
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.800]   You don't panic, you don't try to stop it.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.120]   You're like, okay, let's just roll with it.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.120]   Because I noticed that among that particular subset.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.080]   I was like, wow, they're a good example for me
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.280]   because they were so chill.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.180]   We don't know what's gonna change.
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.100]   So what we're gonna do is we're gonna pivot
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.800]   our business here, we'll do this, no factor.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.760]   They always say no factor.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.440]   No factor, we do this, we'll change, we'll roll.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.780]   So I don't know, maybe what we're seeing there
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.740]   is an example of people just through happenstance
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.400]   of their particular profession,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.040]   we're a little bit more comfortable with change
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.240]   than, let's say, the rest of us
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.100]   who work on laptops for a living.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.500]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't listen to those podcasts
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.540]   too frequently, but I'd have to imagine
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.200]   that that is a highly adaptable environment to grow up in,
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.140]   being an elite Navy SEAL.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.340]   The writer in me, because I'm not a tough guy
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.420]   elite Navy SEAL, would say it's also a beautiful metaphor
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.200]   because in the Navy, you're literally operating on water.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   And water is fluid, and water has the ability
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.800]   to flow around things instead of get stuck on them.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.720]   So maybe it's just something about spending years and years
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.040]   on water where you don't have control
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.840]   and in a job where you have to be adaptable.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.020]   And then something like COVID comes along
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.260]   and it's like, well, why shouldn't our generation
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.780]   have a big pandemic?
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.920]   - Yeah, yeah, and that seemed to be the big difference
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.600]   was whether your thought was this will go back
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.960]   to normal next week, it will, it has to,
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.880]   I'm just taking out that news, and the people that said,
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.640]   oh, this is a new configuration, how should we change?
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.120]   Or let's roll with the idea that this might take a long time
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.520]   or let's cover that option, you know, hey, this could be,
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.120]   we don't know, there's a real pragmatism or a real realism.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.340]   Let's take a brief break from our conversation with Brad
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.020]   to talk about one of the sponsors
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.120]   that makes this show possible.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.400]   I'm talking about our longtime friends at Grammarly.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.420]   And when it comes to writing,
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.920]   which again is one of the most important skills
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.880]   in the 21st century, being able to write clearly
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.680]   means you're able to convince people of things.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.320]   It means you're able to think clearly.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.160]   It means you're able to get people's attention.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.160]   When it comes to writing, Grammarly there is to support you
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.240]   from beginning to end.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.840]   Now for over 10 years, Grammarly has been embracing
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.640]   artificial intelligence to help you make your writing better.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.120]   They have now updated and improved this AI skills
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.360]   to a brand new level, harnessing the power of generative AI.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.520]   The new Grammarly now can help you, for example,
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.440]   come up with ideas.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.440]   You might say, give me 10 sample taglines
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.140]   for a video thumbnail I'm writing about this topic.
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.420]   It will give you ideas to get your thinking starting.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.040]   You can say, okay, here's something I just wrote.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.280]   Hey, Grammarly, rephrase this more concisely
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.160]   and it will take what you wrote and it'll clean it up
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.560]   and make it sharper.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.080]   You can even have it do things like summarize text.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.200]   You can say, okay, here is this big email
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.040]   that I just received.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.820]   Can you summarize this in a quick paragraph
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.340]   that I can put into the note-taking document I have?
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.360]   This is all of course, in addition to the standard
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.280]   industry-leading ability that Grammarly has

[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:47.680]   I also wanna talk about our good friends at ZocDoc.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.240]   ZocDoc is a free app where you can find amazing doctors
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.640]   and book appointments online.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.760]   We're talking about booking appointments
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.080]   with thousands of top-rated patient review doctors
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.920]   and specialists.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.480]   You can filter specifically for the ones
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.800]   who take your insurance, are located near where you live,
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.240]   and can treat almost any condition you're searching for.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.600]   Now, this is one of these tools that makes so much sense.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.400]   It would be almost criminal for you not to use it.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.440]   As you go through life, you will need doctors
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.320]   for various ailments that you might have.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.080]   One of the harder, more annoying chores in modern life
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.360]   is finding a doctor.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.120]   And until recently, this usually meant just asking people,
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.680]   "Hey, do you have a recommendation for a podiatrist?"
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.120]   They say, "I don't know, here's my guy."
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.200]   And then you call them and they don't take your insurance
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.240]   or they don't have appointments open until 2027.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.600]   ZocDoc says, "Why don't we help you do this with an app?"
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.480]   You say, "Here's the type of doctor I'm looking for.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.440]   "Here's where I live.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.840]   "Here's my insurance."
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.520]   It will say, "Great, here are all of the doctors nearby
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.280]   "who take your insurance and are accepting new patients."
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.120]   Then you can look closer and say,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.120]   "Okay, but are these good or not?
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.920]   "Well, let me look at patient reviews of these doctors.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.760]   "Maybe this doctor, they say,
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.240]   "you're gonna have a long waiting time.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.720]   "This other one, they say this doctor is great, like good.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.160]   "Let's book that doctor."
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.000]   And then often once you actually sign up with that doctor,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   ZocDoc can help you book those appointments
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.200]   to see the doctor online,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.080]   get automatic reminders in text messages or emails,
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.840]   fill out paperwork online ahead of your appointment
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.160]   to make it all faster.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.480]   ZocDoc is the tool
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.520]   for making medical care much more convenient.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.560]   So if you've ever been sick
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.400]   or ever had anything wrong with you medically,
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.120]   you gotta be using ZocDoc.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.960]   So go to ZocDoc.com/deep
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.120]   and download the ZocDoc app for free
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.240]   and then find and book a top rated doctor today.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.240]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, .com.com/deep.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.160]   If you can say it three times fast, I'll be impressed.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.280]   But anyways, let's see how good that is
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.960]   by getting more towards the solution.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.880]   So you have this phrase, rugged flexibility.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.760]   So let's talk about that.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.480]   What makes up rugged flexibility
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.360]   as the proper response to change?
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.800]   - Right, so rugged flexibility.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.000]   You normally think of these two words,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.160]   rugged and flexible, as opposites.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.080]   So rugged is durable, potentially even rigid,
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.920]   and flexible is loose and it bends.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.280]   And we like to think very this or that, linear.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.880]   Yet when you combine these two terms,
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.720]   you get something that is durable
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.120]   through its ability to bend.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:31.960]   - Interesting.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.180]   - And that, in a nutshell, is rugged flexibility.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:39.180]   Now, you look at change on the grandest scale,
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:44.400]   which is evolution, like the ongoing dance of life.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.900]   And when you think about species that persist and endure,
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.440]   they have two core qualities.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.880]   The first quality is they have some kind of identity
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.520]   that makes them what they are, that they hold onto,
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.000]   that does not change.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.480]   Because if that thing changed,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.760]   they would no longer be that species.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.840]   They would evolve into something new.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.160]   But outside of that core quality,
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   they are so adaptable and flexible.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.480]   So if they were just flexible
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.840]   and they didn't have the ruggedness,
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.180]   well then they would become
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.360]   something completely unrecognizable.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.920]   If they were just rugged and rigid
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.160]   and didn't have the flexibility, they'd be selected out.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.000]   - Right.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.320]   - So that's how species respond to change over time.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.560]   - It was like the finch's beak.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.600]   - Exactly. - It gets longer,
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.720]   but it's still a finch.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.680]   - Exactly.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.760]   And you see this in organizational science.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.040]   You see that the most successful companies,
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.200]   they have these core properties
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.940]   that make them what they are,
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.520]   yet they apply those properties
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.620]   and those qualities differently
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.680]   as the circumstances change.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.640]   You see this in phenomenal athletes.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.720]   Every athlete has to go through aging.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   The athletes that are really stubborn
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.200]   and don't try to change their style as they age,
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.240]   they play really poorly.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.400]   They get evolutionarily selected out.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.480]   - They're like baseball pitchers.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.600]   - Yeah, but the athletes that are able to change
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.440]   how you pitch and to change your style of game
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.560]   or a basketball player that used to be really physical
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.160]   and get to the basket, learning how to play outside more,
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.760]   yet there's still these trademark things
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.680]   that make them who they are.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.720]   So they marry this ruggedness with flexibility.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.560]   - MJ's fading jump shot.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.400]   - Yeah.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.240]   - A little '90s reference here.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.760]   - I mean, we could talk about '90s basketball forever,
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.320]   but there's so many examples.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.040]   And then you think about high performers in knowledge work,
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.560]   and it's the same kind of thing.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.440]   You have to be able to adapt
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.000]   and to be flexible in the midst of change.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.500]   Now, I am equal parts philosophy and science
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.360]   when I write these books.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.700]   So I'm gonna say this is like kind of
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.480]   the Brad Stahlberg philosophy that's forming on change.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.800]   So then I go to the literature,
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.000]   and we say that homeostasis is rigid.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.880]   It's all about getting back to normal.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.160]   We know it doesn't work.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.360]   I mentioned that the scientific community
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.680]   in the late '80s and early '90s
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.240]   switched to this model of change that they call allostasis.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.480]   And what allostasis says is that, yes,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.680]   living systems do crave stability,
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.900]   but that stability is a result
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.220]   of their being able to change.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.560]   Allostasis literally comes from the Greek roots allo,
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.980]   which means variable, and stasis, which means stable.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.040]   So you are stable through being variable.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.520]   Peter Sterling, the scientist that coined this term,
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.160]   the term allostasis defines it as stability through change.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.360]   And I think it's beautiful 'cause it has a double meaning.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.520]   Yes, you can be stable through change,
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.320]   and the way to be stable through change
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.200]   is to some extent by changing.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.440]   - So is it fair to say a disrupting event
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.840]   is going to change your configuration?
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   And it could change it,
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.560]   I'm trying to be overly scientific here,
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.360]   and it could put you into an unstable configuration
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.440]   that's not sustainable.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.160]   - And it hurts. - Yeah, and it hurts.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.560]   - Emotionally, physically, socially, it's chaotic.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.480]   - Yeah, and you can't stop that from happening.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.200]   If you are a species or whatever, an entity,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.360]   that can change, this gives you the ability
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.180]   to then move from that unstable configuration
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.960]   to a nearby stable configuration.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.280]   So is that a way of capturing,
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.000]   you need the ability of change to have stability,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.560]   because if you can't change,
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.680]   and you're just existing somewhere that's stable for now,
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.720]   you're gonna get knocked into something unstable anyways,
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.200]   and you need change to move.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.320]   That's how you move from the unstable
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.280]   to something else stable,
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.000]   and it might be the nearest stable thing
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.420]   is not where you were before.
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.040]   - 100%, when you were saying that,
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.560]   the visual that came to my mind
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.000]   is you could picture us as people, as organizations,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   even as societies, stable points were a group of marbles
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.160]   that are all tightly together, and then change happens.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.620]   Small change, it's a little pebble,
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.160]   the marbles kind of splay.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.760]   Big change, it's like a rock, and the marbles go everywhere.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.080]   If you try to get the marbles
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.360]   exactly the same way they were before,
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.380]   you're gonna run into all kinds of resistance,
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.880]   and it probably will be a very long, windy road
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.940]   to get there, and you probably will never get back
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.060]   to where you were.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.880]   Whereas if you look out at the future, and you say,
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.280]   "Oh, it's not good to have these marbles everywhere.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.440]   "They should be close together,
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.260]   "but the configuration is gonna be different
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.400]   "than it was before," that's allostasis in a nutshell.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.760]   - So when we're talking about humans,
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.680]   what are we looking for when we say stability?
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.440]   Like what's the actual good here that we're seeking?
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.040]   - Ooh, that's a great question.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.460]   I think that the good here that we're seeking
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.460]   is an ability to have some valid prediction
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.300]   on what is going to happen next.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.240]   So you think about in a world where it's true chaos,
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.740]   and you have no idea what's gonna happen next,
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.560]   navigating that world would be impossible.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.760]   So we are prediction machines, and we tend to feel good
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.240]   when we can predict what's next.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.800]   That's why people like having routines,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.120]   'cause it makes it somewhat easy
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.800]   to predict what's happening next.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.600]   Now rigidity becomes when you get so attached
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.100]   to those predictions that you can't go off course,
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.160]   even if there's a tornado coming, or a hurricane,
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.720]   or a monsoon, or whatever weather metaphor
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.920]   you wanna use.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.960]   So stability is about having a sense
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.940]   of what's gonna come next,
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.320]   and being able to make that prediction
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.760]   so that you can live your life,
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.200]   but when unforeseen circumstances come,
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.560]   quickly change that prediction,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.240]   and not freak out in its midst.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.400]   - Interesting, so we wanna know,
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.860]   we want some familiarity with what's gonna come next.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.440]   That's interesting, we're prediction, is this why--
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.720]   - We are prediction, so to me,
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.160]   this was the most interesting part,
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.480]   intellectually, of the book,
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.280]   was learning about what consciousness actually is,
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.940]   and how consciousness functions,
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.680]   and the brain is one big prediction machine,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.580]   and when reality doesn't match our expectations,
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.840]   it throws us for a loop.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.240]   So we have to be prediction machines.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.440]   The metaphor, not the metaphor,
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.640]   the example I use in the book to make this clear,
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.680]   is imagine if every time you're walking down the tarmac
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.220]   to get on a plane, your brain didn't predict
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.200]   that it was gonna end in an airplane.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.400]   Well, you never walk down the tarmac,
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.040]   'cause you think, well, maybe I'm gonna fall off a cliff,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.640]   maybe there's gonna be snakes there,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.240]   but because we know airports,
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.340]   we have a mental model for it,
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.580]   we can predict that when I step off this tarmac,
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.240]   I'm gonna step onto an airplane.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.400]   And we go through life making these predictions,
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.320]   and to me, what change ultimately is,
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.400]   is it's something that proves our prediction wrong.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.880]   - Right, so when we successfully predict something,
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.400]   it feels good, or more importantly,
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.800]   when we fail to predict something, it sounds alarm bells,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.120]   which is useful in the moment,
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.440]   when the Asheville Airport has a snake issue
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.080]   at the tarmac or whatever,
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.480]   but if you're constantly in that state,
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.000]   so if you constantly have alarm bells going off,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.200]   that's unsustainable.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.700]   You're exhausting your brain,
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.580]   which is why we crave stability,
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:14.420]   means we crave a place
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.620]   where mainly our predictions are right.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.020]   - Yep, and to blow your mind for a second,
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.340]   I'm gonna bring it back to where we started in biology.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.140]   This is exactly what the immune system does.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.060]   So the immune system, there's a pathogen,
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.740]   it makes a prediction based on something it's seen before,
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.880]   and then it marshals a response to fight it.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.100]   If the pathogen is new, it has no prediction for it,
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.940]   what happens?
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.540]   There's disorder, there's sickness,
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.180]   and if you're a strong, vibrant system,
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.660]   you build up immunity the next time it predicts right.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.800]   What is an overreactive immune system?
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.680]   It's a disease, it's a disorder,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.400]   and that is an immune system
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.560]   that never knows if there's snakes on the plane.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.340]   So this is really a pretty universal principle.
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.240]   - Yeah, that's very interesting.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.360]   So then let's overlay a little bit of ethics on this
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.200]   or what have you.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.460]   So we know just fundamentally the human brain,
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.800]   putting aside any sort of values,
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.160]   the human brain wants predictability.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.680]   It's stressful not to, we can't exist in that state.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.060]   And that stability in some senses, it's predictable.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.280]   Now can we measure the desirability
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.640]   of different stable conditions
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.320]   by how much does it align
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.760]   with the things we actually care about?
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.560]   So does the challenge now become,
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.380]   I wanna find stability,
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.680]   and among options that are stable,
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.960]   I would like to find an option if possible
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.320]   that reflects the things I actually care about.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.800]   - Yeah, I think that this does switch to ethics
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.400]   and to psychology as well that would say
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.640]   that we are thriving when we are in a state of stability,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.460]   not rigidity, but stability in a way that aligns
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.220]   with the things that we value in our lives.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.460]   - So would you say, I'm summarizing things,
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.780]   but one way of thinking about rugged flexibility
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.380]   is you're able with some proficiency to,
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.540]   when disrupted from a moment of stability
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.260]   by outside events, to relatively proficiently
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.700]   find your way to new stability
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.580]   that still connects to your values.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.420]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.420]   - And you're able to say this is the goal,
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.040]   is to spend as much of your life as possible
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.400]   on these types of peaks in the landscape of configuration.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.860]   - So your values are the ruggedness,
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.360]   and then the flexibility is how you pursue those values
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.000]   based on changes around you in the environment.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.840]   - This is useful.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.840]   Okay, so yeah, think about the ruggedness here is--
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.280]   - Your values, what you stand for.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.800]   - It's my family, it's my--
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.000]   - Whatever it is, your intellect,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.880]   your creativity, your health,
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.160]   but the flexibility is how are you going to cultivate,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.320]   nourish, spend time on those things
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.740]   in a world where everything is changing always,
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.240]   including you, you're gonna get old.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.920]   How you think about your family is gonna change
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.300]   when your kids get old, when you get old,
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.200]   when your partner gets old.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.840]   How you think about your health is gonna change.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.380]   - Yeah.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.840]   - The other metaphor I like to use,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.560]   because I just, I think and write in metaphors,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.060]   is that of a river.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.200]   So a river is really, really fluid,
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.560]   and there's water, and there's this famous Heraclitus quote,
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.680]   "You can't step into the same river twice," right?
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.800]   The river is this perennial representation of change,
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.100]   which I think is beautiful.
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.720]   But if a river didn't have any banks,
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.360]   it would just be water, chaotic water.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.760]   That is not beautiful.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.760]   So what are the banks of the river?
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.960]   To me, those are like the rugged boundaries
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.280]   that are our core values.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.000]   So I think of identity this way.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.800]   I've got my core values,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.400]   and those are the rugged boundaries of Brad Stahlberg.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.540]   But I need to be flexible enough to be like the water
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.560]   that flows in between those boundaries
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.040]   to move this way and that
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   as things around me and within me change.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.760]   - What about fear in this picture?
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.860]   So maybe another thing that would draw you back
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.620]   towards the stability you knew before the disruption
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.020]   is the fear that you're not gonna be able
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.860]   to find a new stability.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.140]   So like to make it concrete,
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.460]   let's say Georgetown starts listening to my podcast.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.820]   What is this nonsense?
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.180]   All right, you're out of a job here.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.260]   We don't want you at a university before.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.540]   Rugged flexibility would say,
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.660]   I would need to find a different professional configuration
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.660]   that still was stable and valued,
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.360]   and would look different to what I was doing.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.980]   But there's the fear of what if I'm not able
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.820]   to find something else?
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.660]   What if I was lucky to be on this mountain
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.580]   in the fitness landscape,
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.780]   but I don't have it in me to get back?
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.580]   How do you deal with the fear aspect?
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.460]   - I mean, the first thing I say is welcome to being a human.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.300]   So there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.780]   - I demand nothing bad or unknown ever happening.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.500]   Come on, Brad, this is not too hard.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.520]   - Yeah, so it's both sides of that coin.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.500]   It's that like shit's gonna happen,
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.020]   and you're gonna face fear.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.100]   That's completely normal.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.660]   So I think the first thing is normalizing both those things,
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.980]   that stuff's gonna happen and not all changes are positive,
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.300]   and that it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.620]   and to feel fear when you're in the midst of change.
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.820]   Now, what the research shows really clearly
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.860]   is trying to repress or suppress that fear
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.860]   or push it away never works.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.360]   It just bubbles up and gets stronger and stronger.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.180]   Stewing in that fear and falling into despair
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.220]   is also a really poor strategy.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:57.220]   So taking small micro actions is the best way out of fear.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.420]   Literally in our brain, what happens is the two networks,
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.700]   the network that's involved in a stress response and fear,
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.820]   and the network that's involved in moving towards a goal
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.480]   and taking productive actions,
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.260]   they operate on zero-sum systems.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.500]   So they both can't be online at once.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.220]   They call this the rage pathway,
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.260]   which then turns into the sadness pathway.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.820]   This is fear, anxiety, and the seeking pathway,
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.800]   which is goal pursuit, and they fight for resources.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:26.100]   So the best way out of fear is to start taking small actions
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.540]   to turn on your seeking pathway,
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.420]   which turns off your rage pathway.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.260]   We also see this a ton in clinical situations.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.860]   So the gold standard treatment for depression
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.060]   is behavioral activation,
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.500]   which literally is just start doing stuff.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.420]   Because it's impossible for your brain
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.620]   to be in complete despair, I can't get out of bed,
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.780]   at the same time that your brain is functioning
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:45.820]   to help you do stuff.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.660]   - That's interesting.
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.540]   So you're saying the magnitude of,
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.840]   let's say, the goal-seeking behavior you're doing,
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.660]   it doesn't have to be these steps I'm taking right now
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.260]   are very likely going to get me back
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.020]   to just as good of a job, or get rid of all of my,
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.260]   it'll solve all the problems 'cause I lost my job.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.420]   That's not the goal.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.640]   The goal is just activating a different network,
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.060]   because even if that network is activated
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.480]   with something small versus something big,
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.560]   the network is still going.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.600]   And if that network's still going,
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.500]   the other more maladaptive network, the rage network,
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.140]   that network can't get, that's very interesting.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.420]   So you start with something positive
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.860]   without worrying too much about,
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.260]   is this the exact right step?
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.580]   Is this step on its own,
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.460]   one step away from solving all my problems?
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.340]   That's not the goal.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.260]   The goal is changing what part of your brain
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.400]   is actually turned on.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.260]   - Exactly.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.100]   - That is interesting.
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.340]   Okay, that's an interesting way of thinking about it.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.780]   So the fear will happen, and that's fine.
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.780]   We throw some acceptance commitment therapy at this.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.600]   - Yep. - Okay.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.500]   - Yep. - All right, I have fear.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.320]   That sucks.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.160]   That's how it feels.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.020]   All right, what next?
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.420]   Maybe I can't get that job back,
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.980]   or I can't get a job like that back,
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.140]   but I need to find something stable
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.240]   and something that reflects my values.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.940]   So I guess that's what we're gonna do
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.940]   is start taking some steps towards that right now
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.180]   without dwelling on how you feel,
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.700]   without dwelling on the source of the feelings.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.180]   Man, I'm never gonna get that Georgetown job back,
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.700]   and it's just never gonna be the same.
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.340]   You start taking the actions.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.020]   - Yep, it's, well, here we are.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.600]   This sucks.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.060]   Man, I feel like crap.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:14.900]   I'm terrified.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:15.720]   Of course I am.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.120]   I'm entering a period of disorder and instability,
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.060]   and yet I can take all those feelings and thoughts
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.340]   along for the ride,
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.620]   and I can just start taking these small actions
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:29.180]   in the direction of my values and see what opens up.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:31.120]   Now, the other thing that can be really helpful
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.900]   in these circumstances is to borrow support,
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.800]   and that's like the really scientific way
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.940]   of saying lean into community or friends.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.780]   In the initial allostatic model,
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.820]   when a system is overloaded
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.860]   with distress and disorganization,
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.140]   it often seeks to borrow support.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.940]   So the way that you see this in the body
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.860]   is when one organ fails,
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.900]   oftentimes there has to be upregulation
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.260]   somewhere else in the body to make up for that.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.260]   So when one person in a tribe fails,
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.620]   there has to be upregulation elsewhere in the tribe
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.860]   to make up for that failure
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.240]   while that person gets back to stability.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.660]   So when you have instability in your own life
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.060]   in one area of your life,
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.700]   two strategies are really helpful.
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.780]   One, lean into areas elsewhere in your life
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.520]   where things might be going well
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.880]   just to get that brain out of despair mode,
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.260]   and then the second is lean into your community,
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.740]   lean into your friends for help and support.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.580]   - Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.380]   Okay, so then, yeah.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.580]   - Well, I was just gonna say one more thing,
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.060]   and we'll probably go there
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.160]   because I know offline we talked about this part of the book,
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.460]   but I think that this is so important, too,
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.760]   to how we think about our sense of self and our identity
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.060]   and how important it is to have multiple hats
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:40.900]   that we can wear.
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.180]   It doesn't mean we need to wear them all at the same time,
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.680]   but to have multiple hats that we can put on
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.100]   so that if I have a book that flops,
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.100]   which inevitably will happen if I read enough books,
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.060]   I can then lean into my role as a coach,
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.780]   my role as a parent, my role as an athlete,
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.100]   or if my training at the gym goes to crap,
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.140]   I can then lean into my writing and my parenting.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.240]   When my kids grow up and move out of the house,
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.100]   I can then lean into my training.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:11.100]   So it's having enough hats or, you know,
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.620]   you don't have to put all your eggs in one basket,
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.980]   but you should have a couple baskets
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.260]   that you can put your eggs into.
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.820]   - Right, so this is what our common friend
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.420]   who we're actually coincidentally meeting,
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.660]   what, in like a half hour,
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.620]   Derek Thompson has this term, workism,
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.460]   which if I understand the definition properly
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.300]   is you get your full identity, let's say, out of your work.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.420]   This is one of the hidden dangers of that
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.700]   is because what happens when your work goes bad?
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.160]   - Exactly, you're not rugged or flexible.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.400]   - Yeah, it's like the stockbrokers in 1929.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.240]   - Exactly.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.060]   So I talk about in the book,
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.180]   like diversifying your sense of self.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.420]   So Dave Epstein wrote this wonderful book called "Range",
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.620]   my guess is many of your listeners have read it.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.920]   And it basically says it's really good to have range.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.000]   Like this idea of specialization is an endpoint is good,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.580]   but you wanna start by exploring
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.380]   all kinds of different activities.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.260]   What I argue is that that same thing applies
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.540]   to your identity.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.860]   So forget activities, it's really good to think of yourself
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.180]   in different ways.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.460]   Because when these big disorder events,
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.420]   these big changes happen in our lives
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.920]   that affect us perhaps in one or two domains,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.400]   it's nice to have another domain that we can lean on
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.000]   while we reorganize elsewhere.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.920]   - The example that my audience knows well,
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.620]   because it's the one I talk about a lot,
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:25.620]   is my dual focus coming up on writing and academia.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.400]   And both of those are brutal mistresses
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.160]   from a professional perspective.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.140]   And I really did take advantage of the ability
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.040]   to lean from one to the others.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.320]   Coming up in academia is very stressful.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.680]   There's periods where your research program
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.480]   is not working, papers being rejected.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.920]   I would lean into the writing.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.160]   And then there's peers writing is very stressful too.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.140]   It's a competitive market.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.160]   And there's time where your books
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.560]   aren't doing what you want them to do.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.920]   And I could lean into a professor
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.120]   and I have this paper over here is going well or some such.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.800]   And I talk about that a lot on the show.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.520]   I sit and have the terminology
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.840]   that is really an advanced allostatic strategy
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.720]   that I was deploying.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.600]   What about the developing, I'm just thinking out loud now,
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.560]   developing new domains.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.160]   I wonder if that's part, new domains of your identity.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.000]   I mean, it seems in general,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.680]   that's just a healthy exercise
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.120]   to make sure you have a diversity of identities.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.880]   But is that also a part of change perhaps
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.640]   is I'm now at this stage of my life,
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.520]   maybe in response to a big change,
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.120]   I'm going to begin developing another hat to put on,
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.600]   another aspect of my identity.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.560]   - Exactly, yep.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.600]   And that's back to that stability somewhere new.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.120]   So we like to have stable identities, right?
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.400]   When we don't have a stable narrative
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.740]   around a sense of self, we define that as psychosis.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.140]   And that's like a really dangerous mental illness.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.080]   So having no narrative or no cohesive sense of self is bad.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.900]   Having way too rigid a sense of self, workism,
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.180]   I'm Cal Newport, all I do is write bestselling books,
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.840]   that makes you really fragile.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.560]   So how do we have a good story,
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.160]   but also a story that's flexible
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.020]   and a story that we're continuing to write as we go?
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.360]   In these opportunities of disorder,
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.200]   when the chips are all over the table,
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.100]   we can bring them back together,
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.200]   maybe 90% of the way that they were before,
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.020]   but 10% has got to be different.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.720]   - So when we go back to your two years
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.100]   of tumultuous change, it was all compressed.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.920]   What were some of these ideas we just discussed
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   that played out well in your own response to all the change?
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.240]   - So the first was to not try to get back
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.160]   to where I was in any of these domains.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.840]   The second was not to compare my new reality
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.600]   to my old reality.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.960]   And then the third was just get started
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.160]   and start taking these small actions in the new reality.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.920]   And then I'd say the fourth was shifting identity.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.680]   So my calf injury is probably the easiest to look at,
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.520]   'cause it's the most extreme.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.920]   I used to run marathons, I was pretty good,
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.200]   and can't run anymore.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.040]   - And it's very sudden.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.800]   It's, oh, by the way, you just learn you have--
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.320]   - It was a chronic condition, but I was fighting through it,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.640]   and then it was like, yeah, this has gotten to the point
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.280]   where you're not gonna be able to run
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.920]   without your leg feeling like it's a balloon about to pop.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.080]   - Right, 'cause you probably thought at first,
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.080]   we'll get past this.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.160]   Like, this is something I need to solve.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.600]   So there's this one moment where a doctor says,
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.680]   you're not gonna be running anymore.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.840]   - Yeah, and it's like the third doctor,
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.680]   'cause I'm a runner.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.080]   So I'm like, eh, maybe that doctor's just wrong.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:17.920]   So then it became very clear.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.000]   I'm gonna need this pretty significant surgery on my calf,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.080]   and I'm probably not gonna be able to run again.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.200]   And that sucked, but I zoomed out,
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.200]   and I'm like, hold on, what's my value here?
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.680]   And my value is health and athleticism.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.080]   And running is just one way to do it.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.840]   So I shifted to powerlifting,
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.240]   completely different sport,
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.960]   like couldn't be more different.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.520]   And I sucked at it when I first started.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.920]   I had to get a coach, I had to relearn the form.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.960]   I had to retrain my muscle fibers.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.080]   Like, everything about it was different,
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.840]   but I didn't sit there and dwell on the fact for too long.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.000]   I dwelled on it for a little that I couldn't run,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.080]   and I said, my actual value here is health and athleticism,
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.920]   and running was a very narrow way to get it,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.400]   and maybe I over-identified with myself as a runner.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.140]   So let me shift, let me apply that value elsewhere,
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.480]   and then let me pursue an activity
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.560]   that my body will now allow me to do.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.000]   Same thing with moving to Asheville.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.960]   Asheville is lovely, and it's very different than Oakland.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.080]   So rather than try to recreate Oakland and Asheville,
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.680]   and compare my Asheville friends to my Oakland friends,
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.480]   and my Asheville coffee shops to my Oakland coffee shops,
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.120]   I said, all right, like, it's not gonna be the same.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.880]   It's not better, necessarily.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.120]   It's not worse, necessarily.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.060]   It's different.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.920]   So let me start taking these small actions
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.800]   to rebuild stability here.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.520]   And I think so often we latch onto the old,
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.320]   or we try to get back to the old,
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.360]   and instead of saying, like, the faster we can say,
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.840]   this is what's happening, I feel disordered,
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.160]   I have to recreate stability,
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.440]   and it's going to look different than it was before.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.600]   - Well, I remember when you first moved to Asheville,
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.160]   one of the things you did was try to find
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.040]   what is unique about this place
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.600]   that maybe we didn't have in Oakland
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.440]   that you could lean into.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.520]   So in particular, these mountain trails,
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.820]   and the ability to, pretty close from your house,
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.960]   to be in the woods, and lean into that,
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.920]   as opposed to having your favorite coffee shipped in,
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.160]   you know, FedExed hot from the place, or whatever.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.000]   I remember that about you.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.080]   Like, well, this is what I couldn't do in Oakland,
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.260]   I can do here.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.600]   Let's do that every day.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.520]   - Yep, exactly.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.440]   And at first, it was a little bit discombobulating.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.160]   I mean, I left behind two really close friends.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.340]   I left behind a huge intellectual community
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.920]   between Stanford and Berkeley.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.640]   And for a while, I'm like,
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.720]   ugh, I hope this was the right move.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.880]   And now it's turned out to definitely be the right move.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.800]   - You know, does it make you feel better?
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.160]   I won't mention, we won't mention any actual names,
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.680]   but a friend we have in common from Oakland
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.760]   has recently moved out of Oakland as well.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.040]   So does that now make you feel better?
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.320]   That, okay, other people--
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.240]   - We'll have to talk offline,
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.600]   I don't know who you're talking about.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.560]   - Oh, I can, yeah, I can.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.120]   Think about people, I'm not gonna talk about online.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.840]   Think about people we know in common in Oakland.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.240]   - All right. - They're not there anymore.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.360]   (both laughing)
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.180]   See, maybe that's not rugged flexibility,
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.360]   is trying to schadenfreude.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.760]   Like, well, other people left too.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.600]   So maybe it wasn't so.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.520]   Trying to make the old point of stability bad,
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.960]   that's probably another maladapted response, right?
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.720]   Like, actually, that sucked.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.200]   That old job was terrible.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.800]   Oakland was for the birds, you know?
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.280]   - But then it's still living rent-free.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.640]   - Their baseball team is leaving.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.480]   - In your mind.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.520]   And I wanna be clear,
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.960]   this gets back to good or bad change.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.640]   We wanted to move to Asheville.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.840]   This wasn't forced on us.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.040]   This was a choice that we made.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.360]   It was a good choice, and it was still hard.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   And I think that that's just how change works.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:31.800]   - Yeah, and you have a AA baseball affiliate,
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.680]   while Oakland is losing their major league team.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.800]   - So, no tourist.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.640]   - Again, we go back.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.480]   I'm reading a book.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.760]   Jesse, my listeners know this, you don't.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.280]   Jesse gave me a book about the tourists.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.520]   So I'm actually reading. - Oh, really?
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.240]   - I'm reading a book right now about Asheville and the tourists,
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.600]   and it makes Asheville seem very nice.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.440]   - Oh, Asheville's lovely.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.060]   I mean, I think that if we could get the Newport clan
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.480]   down there for a long weekend,
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.160]   you might be moving to Asheville soon.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.280]   - Yeah, we were gonna create our own
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.440]   center of power down there.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.280]   - That's right.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.760]   - I think we went into this last time you were on the show
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.360]   about how we were gonna start our own new--
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.200]   - New venture.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.600]   - New venture, new world of riders.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.440]   It was gonna be--
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.260]   - I really think we could.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.100]   We were talking about this a little offline.
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:07.940]   There's just so much overlap,
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:08.920]   and there aren't too many people
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.220]   that are approaching these topics
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.840]   in the same way that we are.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.720]   And we kind of informally team up.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.560]   Not kind of.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.460]   We do informally team up,
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.160]   and maybe one day I can convince you guys
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.840]   to come to Asheville, and we'll formally team up.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.680]   - That's what we need.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.240]   We need a bookstore with podcast studios
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.080]   and offices above it.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:23.900]   - I already have the name.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.540]   The Asheville Center for Deep Work
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.220]   and Sustainable Excellence.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.380]   Doesn't that have a nice ring to it?
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.300]   - I like that.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.660]   And we could concentrate.
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.100]   We could power lift.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.900]   We could have good coffee.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:34.740]   - All the things.
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.180]   - All right, I think we are.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.500]   So that'll be my new stability
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.020]   when I get canceled from Georgetown
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.980]   because of all the nonsense on this show,
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.100]   and I'm raging and not sure what to do.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.180]   That will be the new stability.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.260]   I'll say the key is obviously the next stable peak's
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.500]   gonna be moving to Asheville.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.340]   - I'm here for it.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.180]   - Yeah, I like it.
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.000]   I like it.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.700]   So let's just talk.
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.860]   Whenever I have you here, I like to talk just generally
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:02.300]   'cause we're both people who write a lot about work
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.700]   and meaning, and as you mentioned,
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.300]   in a way that not a lot of other people do.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.660]   So what's your current thoughts today?
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.500]   You're more online than I am.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.620]   What are the trends?
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:10.940]   What are trends going on right now?
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.780]   I'll make this more specific.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:16.460]   What's a trend going on right now in the discourse?
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.620]   We talked about this offline, everyone,
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.740]   the word discourse, on work and meaning.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.220]   What's a trend you like that you see going on?
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.740]   What's a trend you don't like?
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:27.660]   - A trend that I like on work and meaning
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.260]   that I see going on is,
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.100]   whew, there aren't too many.
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.380]   I think that the way--
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:36.380]   - That's meaningful, by the way.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.220]   - Right.
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.500]   - That piece of the, so just to put a footnote on,
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.580]   the subtext here is maybe the online world
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.220]   is not having the best moment when it comes
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.740]   to discussing work and meaning.
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:47.980]   It's maybe too short form.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.820]   - Yeah, I think it's just that.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.340]   I think it's too short form,
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:55.060]   and I think that it is very easy online
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.940]   to get into these polarities of hustle culture,
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:03.940]   obsession, make $8 million and write threads all day
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:09.140]   versus screw work, down with the system,
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.620]   the anti-work Reddit thread, so on and so forth,
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.060]   and I think there's a vast chasm
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.100]   between those two polarities,
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:19.340]   and the online discourse just isn't built for it.
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.500]   I do think that if there's one positive trend,
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.140]   I think that there's been some decent wrestling
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.500]   with the pros and cons of working from home,
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.620]   and I think there's a lot of clowns
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.780]   on both sides of the argument,
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.020]   but I think most serious people have agreed
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.980]   that it's really hard to say which one is better
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:41.980]   because there are big benefits and big negatives to each.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.300]   - Yeah, that's interesting, right, because--
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.940]   - 'Cause at first it was like, work from home's great.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:46.860]   Everyone should work from home,
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.700]   and then some people were like,
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.900]   everyone has to be here FaceTime or else.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.020]   - It became a flex, yeah. - Right, and now I think
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.500]   there's a very real recognition among some people
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:00.180]   that it's a lot easier to form psychological safety
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.940]   and trust in person.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:06.140]   It's a lot easier and simpler to organize in person,
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.580]   but your talent pool, depending on where you are,
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.740]   shrinks a lot, and it becomes a lot harder
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.620]   for people that also want to be a primary parent,
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.020]   so there's these very real trade-offs,
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.660]   and I think going from good or bad to trade-offs
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.020]   is generally a step in the right direction on that topic,
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.340]   and I've seen some of that online.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.620]   - I think that's a good point,
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.580]   'cause I covered that quite a bit back in the day,
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.580]   and I think you're exactly right.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.940]   So I did a lot of New Yorker work on remote work,
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.620]   and it did go through those shifts.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.740]   At first it was a course because health reasons,
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:37.900]   and then there was sort of the flex
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.220]   of we're gonna be back,
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.860]   and then there was this weird moment
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.260]   where advocates of working from home said,
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.260]   let's attach this to all of these other political issues.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.420]   The thought was like, why not?
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.660]   I mean, if we could somehow make it be, whatever,
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.820]   racist to not let us work from home or something,
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.340]   like sometimes that works, but it didn't, right?
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.900]   Because it was an uneasy fit,
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.020]   but then where it ended up is like what you're talking now
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.660]   is everyone is saying, yeah, this is kind of complicated.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.500]   - Yeah, and I think that the people
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:08.740]   that are navigating it through the best
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.440]   are really nonjudgmental about it,
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.780]   because there is no morally right answer,
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.700]   and I don't think there's a right answer for performance.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.740]   I think it depends on the industry,
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.500]   it depends on the stage of the company,
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:22.360]   and it oftentimes depends on the personalities
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.200]   of a leadership team.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.260]   I think that's another great example
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.380]   of order, disorder, reorder somewhere new.
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.180]   So what ended up happening, I think,
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.380]   is that we had order, which was we all worked how we did,
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:33.340]   and then the pandemic came,
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.340]   and then work was blown up, disorder.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.120]   And people are working from home,
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.900]   and there's no real norms around working from home.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.860]   And not only are companies struggling,
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.380]   but people are struggling.
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.740]   Linguishing, quiet quitting, I think,
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.740]   is in large part the result of the complete blurring
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.860]   of boundaries between work and life,
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.700]   because everyone's working from home,
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:56.020]   the time and space markations that we used to have
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.820]   have gone to crap because you can't go out
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.300]   and travel on the weekends.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.260]   So that was pure chaos,
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:03.300]   and now I think we're reorganizing
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.580]   with some hybrid model where work from home
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:10.200]   makes sense in some situations with certain constraints,
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.980]   and return to work makes sense with certain constraints.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.100]   - Well, I'll tell you the solution,
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.780]   my current thought about what's gonna work here.
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.700]   This is where I landed after writing whatever,
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.340]   however many articles I wrote about this,
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.180]   is here's my pitch,
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.980]   you tell me if you believe this or not.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:30.260]   Remote work can work very well,
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.300]   but it requires new structures of work.
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:36.340]   It requires actually, for it to work well and sustainably,
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.140]   it actually requires a restructuring of work
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.860]   in a way that actually is more consilient with remoteness.
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.980]   And so my argument for why there's this weird tension
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.060]   of both sides seem right, both sides seem wrong,
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.660]   is that we are correctly sensing
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.980]   there are huge advantages to a world of work
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.580]   where we don't all have to go to a building.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:59.460]   We're also sensing simply taking what we did in the building
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.780]   and saying, "Let's just do that on Zoom,"
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.220]   doesn't, that's also terrible.
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.140]   And this is the source of this weird love-hate relationship
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.860]   people have when they remember that period
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:08.700]   of pure remote work.
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.740]   There's, "Man, I miss this.
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.020]   "Man, I hated that."
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.340]   And it was both at the same time.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.900]   And so one of the more persuasive interviews I did
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.580]   during that period, I interviewed an entrepreneur
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.740]   who works in this space, and he had this whole theory
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:22.940]   of there is a group of startups
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.020]   that just happened to be starting up and incubating
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.220]   during the early pandemic,
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.660]   so they had to be remote from day one.
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.100]   Because they were building themselves from scratch
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.220]   in this temporary remote environment,
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.940]   they're gonna figure out completely different ways
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.060]   of structuring work and how we communicate and collaborate
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.820]   and how this works, because they're remote from day one.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:43.940]   They're not trying to adapt from something
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.220]   they were doing before.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.380]   And his theory, his name was Chris Hurd,
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.020]   his theory was they're gonna have an advantage,
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:51.740]   the company has to figure this out,
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.500]   they're gonna start doing better in their sector.
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.580]   So right now, these companies are quietly gathering up
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.380]   this accumulated advantage of having the lower overhead,
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.700]   of having the lower staffing costs,
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.780]   of having access to a bigger talent pool
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:04.180]   and doing it in a sustainable way.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.100]   And his thought was eventually what's gonna happen
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.460]   is these companies will get big,
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.340]   what they're doing will get noticed.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.500]   Private equities, now we're getting technical here,
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:15.180]   private equity firms are gonna start hiring away COOs
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.300]   from these companies to essentially inject
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.140]   that same new structure, remote-friendly structure of work
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.100]   into other businesses,
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.260]   because other businesses can have an advantage
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.820]   if they're properly doing remote work.
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:26.660]   And so he had this--
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:27.980]   - It's a brilliant theory.
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:29.540]   It's what private equity loves too,
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.220]   because it's like, how do you cut,
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.820]   even if you don't cut one person,
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.580]   all you do is cut your real estate,
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.860]   and that's 10% of most big city companies,
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.020]   30% of overhead.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.540]   - So then his theory was what you're gonna see is,
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.740]   which I think is what's playing out,
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:41.580]   and I was talking to him in 2021,
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.380]   he's like, "You're gonna see a return
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:44.420]   back towards the office.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.220]   It won't go to where we were in 2019,
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.040]   but it's gonna be for a while,
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.660]   a steady trend of more and more in-person,
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.420]   which we are seeing."
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:55.380]   And then he said, "That's gonna stabilize for a while."
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.420]   And then once this cross-pollination of these ideas happens,
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:59.740]   five years after the pandemic,
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:02.060]   we're talking 2026, we're talking 2027,
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:05.080]   you're gonna start to see this big uptick in remote work,
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.580]   but it's not gonna be just Zoom all day.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.940]   It'll be a whole other structure of work,
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.860]   of how we assign tasks, of communication,
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.140]   something that really works
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.340]   in a natively remote environment.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.340]   So I like that theory.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.260]   I mean, I'm in an industry that's never gonna be remote.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.980]   I mean, I'm a teacher.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.780]   But anyways, that's my theory,
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.260]   and I think it explains a lot of,
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.540]   but hey, I figured this out online.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:27.540]   I wrote about this online, so I think you're right.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.740]   This was a good example of online discourse.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.860]   So we're gonna take another quick break here
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.300]   from our conversation to talk about
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.140]   a sponsor that helps make this show possible,
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:42.440]   and that is our friends at Blinkist.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:48.100]   Blinkist is a subscription service, accessible via an app,
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:53.100]   that gives you summaries of over 5,500 nonfiction books
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.660]   and podcasts.
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.540]   The way it works is simple.
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.500]   If you wanna know more about a book,
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.260]   you find it on the Blinkist app,
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.980]   and it will have a summary called a Blink
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.580]   that you can either read or listen to.
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.620]   It takes about 15 minutes to read or listen to,
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.620]   and you will get all of the big ideas
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:12.000]   from that book delivered right away.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.900]   Now, both Jesse and I use Blinkist
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.380]   as a triage service for our reading life.
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:20.420]   Now, reading is important.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.020]   If you wanna embrace the deep life,
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.020]   Blinkist will help you be a better reader.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.040]   How do we do that?
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.820]   Well, when there's a book we're thinking about reading,
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.620]   we add it to our queue.
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:30.580]   We just write it down somewhere.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.180]   Here's a queue of books we wanna read.
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:34.220]   And when it comes time to buy a new book,
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.700]   instead of just grabbing a book off this list,
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:38.460]   this queue of books we're considering,
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.140]   we will first listen to or read the Blink.
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.500]   Jesse likes to read 'em.
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:43.900]   I like to listen to the Blinks,
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.020]   the short summaries while I'm doing other work.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.400]   It gets the same result.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.060]   We learn the big ideas from the book.
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.340]   Almost always, knowing the main ideas of the book
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.620]   tells you, do I need to buy this
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.780]   or do I already know enough?
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.400]   About half the time, you say, you know what?
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.420]   This book wasn't what I thought, or it is,
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.020]   but I get the big ideas, let's move on.
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.820]   And about half the time, you say, oh yeah,
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.220]   this book I'm excited about.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.660]   So it helps you be much more targeted and focused
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:12.660]   about which books you actually end up buying.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.580]   So you're in the reading,
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.980]   you really should have a Blinkist subscription.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:20.060]   I do wanna mention there's also a cool offer
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.340]   going on right now.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.140]   For a limited time, you can use what's called
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:27.040]   Blinkist Connect to share your premium account.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.540]   So you will get two premium subscriptions
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:29.380]   for the price of one.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:30.420]   You can share one with a friend
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:31.460]   who you think you will like this.
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:34.220]   I think that's a really cool feature.
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:35.540]   We also have a special pricing offer.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.840]   Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.100]   just for our audience.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.580]   If you go to blinkist.com/deep
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.980]   to start a seven-day free trial,
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.980]   you will get 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:52.180]   That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.900]   blinkist.com/deep to get 25% off
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.940]   and a seven-day free trial.
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.500]   That's blinkist.com/deep.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:00.580]   And don't forget while you're there
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.780]   to use Blinkist Connect to share your premium account
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.020]   to get two premium subscriptions for the price of one.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:11.820]   I also wanna talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.820]   Are you using a VPN?
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.500]   If you aren't, this is a problem.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.660]   So here's what happens when you connect to the internet.
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.140]   People can see what websites or services
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:24.260]   you're interacting with.
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.580]   So if you're connecting to a wireless access point,
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.100]   let's say in a coffee shop somewhere,
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:34.660]   anyone nearby can read your packets off of the radio waves
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:37.260]   and say, who is Cal talking to?
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.220]   What website is he downloading information from?
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:40.780]   What service is he using?
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:41.820]   And what about if you're at home
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.660]   in the privacy of your own home?
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:45.540]   Your internet service provider,
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.620]   the person who connects you to the internet
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:52.060]   can see what websites is Cal going to,
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.340]   what services is he accessing?
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.540]   And they can sell that information
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:58.020]   and they do to advertisers and marketers.
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:00.500]   A VPN gives you privacy.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.620]   It helps you regain your privacy.
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:02.460]   Here's how it works.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:04.540]   When you connect, instead of connecting straight
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.060]   to a website or straight to a service,
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.340]   you instead connect to a VPN server.
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:12.420]   You then create a encrypted channel of communication
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.420]   where you tell the VPN server,
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.260]   this is the website I really wanna go to.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:19.620]   This is the service I really wanna use.
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.860]   And the VPN server does that on your behalf,
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:25.820]   encrypts the response and sends it back to you.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.060]   So now if I'm in the coffee shop
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:29.060]   trying to read your packets off the radio waves,
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:30.600]   what do I see?
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.240]   That you're talking to a VPN server.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.780]   If I'm your internet service provider
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.660]   and I'm twisting my mustache
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.180]   and I'm rubbing my hands evilly,
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.380]   like, oh, I'm gonna sell all this information to marketers.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:40.360]   What do I learn?
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.820]   Oh, you're just connecting to a VPN server.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:44.140]   They gain no information
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.560]   about who you're actually talking to
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.980]   or what you're actually doing.
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:49.540]   So you do need a VPN.
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:50.660]   If you're gonna get a VPN,
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:54.360]   I suggest the one that I use, which is ExpressVPN.
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.560]   They have servers all around the world.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.400]   So wherever you are,
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.860]   you're probably not far from a servers.
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.000]   You can make a direct connection.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.220]   They have a good bandwidth on these connections.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.300]   So it's very fast and their software is seamless.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.060]   You turn it on whatever device you're using
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:11.620]   and you use all of your apps and web browsers like normal.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:14.060]   The VPN software takes care of all of this
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.020]   tunneling and encryption in the background.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.980]   You don't even know it's on.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:22.540]   So visit expressvpn.com/deep right now
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:25.340]   and get three extra months of their service for free.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:30.340]   That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S, vpn.com/deep,
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:33.420]   expressvpn.com/deep to learn more.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:34.620]   - Being spot on.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:39.280]   In another like allostatic response to change,
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.420]   we're trying to go back to where we were,
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:44.500]   which is like everyone back in the office
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:47.460]   is kind of like resisting opportunities to move forward
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:48.860]   and to have stability somewhere new.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:52.900]   And I think this mindset clearly applies there
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.580]   and like just taking these small steps, right?
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.100]   Like trying this one small thing,
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.500]   seeing how that works, adjusting as you go.
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.380]   I think the one other thing on this topic
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:06.380]   that I've seen already is how we think about hybrid work
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:10.700]   and whether that means one or two days in the office
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:14.300]   or one week a month or one week every two months
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.940]   or two days a month.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.020]   I think that's gonna be really important.
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.300]   And I could see it larger companies
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.540]   work becoming more regional.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.140]   So I think national is hard
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:26.180]   because then bringing people together is really expensive
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.340]   and you're asking people to travel across the country
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:30.300]   and connecting flights and time zones.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.700]   But I think this regional model
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:35.500]   where maybe you are really good about organizing in person
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.140]   like two days a month,
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.500]   and then it's just a three hour train ride
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.140]   or a one hour flight for most people.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:43.100]   - So New York to DC is a region.
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:43.940]   - Yeah.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:45.500]   - LA to San Francisco.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.320]   - Exactly.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.580]   And I think that's where you can see places
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:51.060]   that used to just be in person now be like a hybrid model.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.140]   - Yeah, well this entrepreneur Chris Hurd,
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:54.900]   one of the models he had in mind would be one
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:58.820]   where you basically gather people semi-regularly
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:00.500]   but not at a building you own.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:01.340]   - Yep.
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:02.940]   - Not at a long-term lease that you're trying to maintain.
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:03.780]   - Yeah, at a hotel, in a resort.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:05.980]   - It's a conference center at a hotel, yeah.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.260]   - And when those things are planned,
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:08.340]   when those things are not planned well,
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:09.380]   they're a total waste of money.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:10.500]   When those things are planned well,
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:13.420]   nothing is better for psychological safety
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.540]   and team building 'cause you're having fun,
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:16.860]   you're getting to know the humans.
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:19.460]   And what's also nice about that is when the whole purpose
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:22.780]   of that or at least the driving force is building teams,
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:23.740]   there's no pressure.
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:25.580]   Like you don't have to do the strategic plan
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.420]   because you're doing all that stuff remote.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.740]   So when the whole purpose becomes let's facilitate
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.220]   team building and camaraderie,
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.260]   you can actually do that really well.
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:35.020]   So that's the model that I think is gonna happen.
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:37.920]   I'm biased because in all my working relationships,
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.380]   that's pretty much like the model that I have.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.220]   Like I'll see people like you twice a year,
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:44.060]   we'll spend a day together, we'll have a great time
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.260]   and like that, I feel like one of my close friends,
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.300]   we're really close, even though we're not together
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.220]   most of the time.
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:53.100]   - Yeah, but if we didn't have the occasional,
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:53.940]   it does make a difference.
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:55.420]   - Oh, for sure, 'cause I know you.
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:56.260]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:57.080]   - I've been in your house.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.820]   Like it really makes a difference, I think.
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.860]   So that's my take is it depends,
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.500]   but I think that that will end up in a creative middle.
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.060]   - So the other thing I always like to ask you about
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.300]   because you see more of this than I do
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.700]   'cause I'm bad at the internet.
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:12.100]   What is the current state of the sort of hustle culture,
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.900]   productivity bro world?
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.660]   Has that been changing at all in recent years,
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.780]   maybe in response to like the anti-work movement
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:22.460]   or is that still just, here's my rented jet
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.660]   that I'm in front of.
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.820]   Now the main change being used chat GPT
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.100]   to make a million dollars a month.
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.660]   I mean, so what, tell me about that world
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.700]   'cause I don't understand that world.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:31.780]   Has it changed recently?
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.660]   - I think the way that it's changed is they've moved
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.040]   to become the best at rest and recovery.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.140]   - They're optimizing.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.620]   - They're optimizing.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.920]   - I'm out resting you, I'm better at resting you.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.440]   Someone told me that if I do a cold plunge,
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.080]   it's gonna help me recover.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.800]   So instead of doing a cold plunge quietly on my own
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.040]   and doing it and not telling anyone and recovering,
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.740]   I'm gonna have a whole camera crew come to my house
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.480]   at 5.30 in the morning.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.920]   I'm gonna wake up my wife and kids
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.040]   because the dogs are gonna bark
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.440]   when the camera crew's here.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.800]   I'm gonna video myself in the cold plunge.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.320]   I'm gonna flex as hard as I can
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.520]   and do nine takes for Instagram.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.680]   - Pushups before.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.520]   - All of that.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.360]   - I learned, we watched a documentary.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.400]   - And then, wait, let me finish.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.960]   I'm gonna post my recovery on social media
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.500]   so that this thing that's supposed to be
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.880]   for decompression and recovery
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.320]   is now gonna be judged and commented on by the world
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.280]   and if it doesn't do well, I'll change my recovery
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.800]   until I find the fad that does do well.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.920]   - And they'll be watching every reaction
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.360]   in a state of stressful anxiety as well,
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.640]   ironically, getting stressed out
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.680]   and anxious about their recovery.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.760]   - Right, and I've kind of been hard on cold plunges
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.560]   and I talked about this on another podcast.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.200]   I'm not anti-cold plunge, I'm anti-cold plunge culture.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.960]   If you wanna take a cold plunge, great.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.280]   If you're gonna take a cold plunge
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.720]   and then tell everyone that it makes you morally superior
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.360]   and that you're activating your brown fat thermogenesis
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.760]   and post 19 pictures of you cold plunging,
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.520]   like, that's A, bullshit,
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.320]   and B, save the nude pictures for yourself, man.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.640]   - So what was it before the switch to rest and recovery?
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:09.080]   Was all the focus in this world on, what,
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:09.920]   muscle growth or something?
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.920]   Or what was the trend?
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.000]   - I think crypto.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:12.840]   - Crypto.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:13.680]   - Crypto was pretty big, right?
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.240]   Because it's this common cycle of,
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.200]   like, the facade of crushing it
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.720]   and underneath a lot of emptiness.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.000]   And that can be psychological,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.280]   but in the case of crypto, it was like,
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.840]   I guess it wasn't physical, it was digital.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.120]   - I got yelled at so much
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.360]   because I would occasionally do segments on the show
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.480]   about crypto and I was not very kind about it
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.200]   because I taught a graduate seminar
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.080]   on the mathematics behind it and I understood it.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.440]   And I said, this is not gonna be what they're saying.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.680]   And you would think that I was coming on
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.680]   and saying baseball and Christianity needs to be banned.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.280]   - Along with carbohydrates.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.560]   - Along with carbohydrates.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.920]   No, I think they would applaud me banning carbohydrates.
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.200]   - I will tell you this about crypto.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.960]   I never understood the use case.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.880]   Like, even the best use cases.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.800]   - What's the problem?
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.560]   - People are like, well, you can transfer money
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.560]   and you can do it so quick.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.280]   And I'm like, PayPal?
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.880]   Like, I just, and I'm sure there will be good use cases.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.200]   - Or like banks can't trick you and like steal your money
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.640]   'cause it's all up.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.480]   But I'm like, when's the last time a bank--
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.800]   - A bank stole my money.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.040]   - Yeah, when's the last time they were like,
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040]   they stole your money when you tried
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.160]   to do a real estate transaction?
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.200]   Like, what's the problem that you're having?
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.080]   - So I've talked to some really smart VCs
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.400]   who believe that like crypto is a currency
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.720]   and solving all the world's problems was hype,
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.880]   but there are gonna be specific uses
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.320]   for this underlying blockchain technology,
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.720]   potentially in like electronic medical records,
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.000]   like not hype-y fields.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.360]   - It's a distributed database.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.360]   - But exactly, but they're gonna be like B2B,
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.720]   not to the public because like this whole use case
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.800]   of like transferring money and safer money,
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.520]   we already have a pretty good financial system.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.240]   And we saw with crypto, well, what happens
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.120]   when you completely decentralize and deregulate?
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.440]   Everyone gets frauded.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.040]   - Yeah, yeah, and right.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.800]   And we know how to, we can have very reliable ledgers.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.640]   I can just put up an open source free SQL database
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.840]   in the Amazon cloud, which will do all of that.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.080]   And yes, it's possible that I could be tricking you
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.680]   and I've hacked a code or whatever,
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.360]   but it's not, they're replicating a function
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.760]   that already exists way less efficiently,
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.480]   but it does have a sort of techno-libertarian
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.560]   philosophical appeal that technically speaking,
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.520]   this is entirely decentralized.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.720]   So it took an existing function
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.600]   and put a different philosophy behind it,
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.720]   but it didn't actually give new functions.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.720]   You know, that's what's weird
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.200]   about our current techno moment with AI.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.120]   And it's different than crypto, but the same in some ways.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.920]   So there's two things going on.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.200]   AI is very, it is very disruptive.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.960]   So unlike crypto, it is very disruptive.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.800]   - I agree.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.640]   - But there is also the exact same YouTubers
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.400]   have gone all in on, you know,
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.400]   AI is either weeks away from launching the missiles
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.160]   or I'm never gonna have to work again
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.040]   once I get my automated, my auto GPT agent set up
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.320]   using link chain is going to do all my jobs for me
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.160]   or whatever.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.280]   And so it's this weird world where we have
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.040]   that same hyper layer of hype,
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.480]   but it's on type of something that actually
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.200]   is worthy of hype.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.080]   - Has more use cases than crypto.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.840]   - But it's not the right type of hype, right?
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.960]   So then it's, and so I'm dealing with a lot of this now
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.680]   as I cover AI is I'm again,
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.960]   dealing with the same YouTube crowd
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.960]   that is, gets very mad at me if I'm not.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.040]   - In either direction probably.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.000]   - Either direction, yeah, it's interesting.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.360]   But unlike crypto, it is really disruptive,
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360]   but it's very confusing
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.480]   because we have this disruptive thing.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.000]   Then we have these huge groups
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.240]   that have built their identity on this has to be
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.680]   the biggest disruption.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.840]   And so if anything,
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.160]   and you also have a whole community of people
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.120]   who've built their thing on,
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.240]   it's not going to be a big deal.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.320]   It's a really confusing world.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.840]   It definitely makes me want to be less online.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.400]   - Based on your wonderful New Yorker piece,
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.720]   the, my working theory on AI,
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.600]   and you think far more about this than me.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.480]   So you could tell me if I'm wrong,
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.720]   is that AI will be extremely disruptive
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:56.920]   in areas where there is strong pattern recognition
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.160]   that are not complex.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.640]   So things aren't changing.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.080]   And there's a lot of precedent.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.920]   So I think like first to third year associates at law firms,
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.240]   AI will eventually probably augment their job
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.200]   in really big ways.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.080]   I'm not convinced that AI is going to churn out books
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.520]   like we write with novel knowledge.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.920]   Now, what I am curious about,
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.000]   and maybe you could tell me this,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.520]   'cause I don't even have the thing on my phone.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   If I said, hey AI, here's a manuscript for my book,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.320]   write it in the voice of George Saunders,
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.560]   Jenny O'Dell, and Cal Newport,
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.400]   combine their voices to create something new
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.280]   and rewrite my manuscript.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.440]   Could it do that?
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.080]   - Well, and we should be careful not to open up the--
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:39.920]   - The AI, sorry.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.160]   - Well, I'm not saying not to open up
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.360]   the third wall or whatever,
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.800]   but we should admit to the audience,
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.600]   we are recording this interview
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.960]   somewhat comfortably in advance.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.360]   - That's true, things could change.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.640]   - Yeah, and things are changing so fast
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.640]   that everything I'm saying here,
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.280]   if it feels like it's really out of sync with reality,
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.160]   'cause we are recording this a little bit in advance,
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.280]   but early summer when we are recording this,
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.600]   I would say that's not the way people
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.680]   are thinking about AI for writing,
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.760]   because that context window's too big.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.880]   It can't deal with 100,000 word manuscript,
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.720]   it can deal with a couple thousand words.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.520]   - But is it a yet situation?
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.320]   - It's unclear, it's unclear.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.720]   The performance seems to degrade
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.440]   as the token count in the context window gets larger,
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.760]   and that might be somewhat fundamental
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:19.600]   with large language models,
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600]   which would make sense, right?
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.000]   I mean, it's a lot of texture giving it.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.280]   And there is an issue with AI,
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.200]   these text-based language models,
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.520]   is we're kind of out of text to train them on.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.920]   I mean, we're training these on basically all the text.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.760]   - Right, and then it gets--
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.600]   - It's years of the internet,
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:36.680]   it's like all the books ever written.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.960]   So it's not like we have a lot more training data,
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.240]   and it's already right now taking 30,000 GPUs,
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.880]   weeks of time to try to train these things.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.600]   So it might just be fundamental,
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.640]   we're not gonna have a huge window.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.520]   But the way people are using it to write is more iterative.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.840]   So it'll be like, well, give me an outline
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.160]   for a book that would--
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.120]   - Yeah, but that's the,
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.400]   so my argument is you can't write a good book
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.920]   without doing the work of writing the outline yourself
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.600]   and getting it wrong nine times.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.920]   - Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.540]   I think where this is all gonna settle out,
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:07.640]   I think there will be,
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.160]   here's my, the article I'm working on at the time
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.000]   that we're talking about this,
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.200]   the conclusion I'm coming to,
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.440]   so this will be out by the time this interview is published.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.160]   The conclusion I'm coming to is that,
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.440]   at least in the professional world,
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.480]   the impact, my best guess is it'll be
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.640]   somewhat comparable to the internet.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.640]   - Yeah, which is huge.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.480]   - Which was big.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.600]   And it did touch almost every office job, right?
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.440]   - Yeah.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.880]   - And let's say the internet plus networks in the office.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.560]   It changed a lot of things.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.120]   The actual interfaces you're dealing with were different.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.200]   There's certain tools you're using a lot
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.040]   that didn't exist in 1994, like an email client.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.480]   It didn't, however, have the effect,
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.060]   let's say on knowledge work
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.320]   that we had with the rise of industrialization
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.020]   where it reshaped the economy
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.240]   so that the countryside emptied out
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.120]   as people moved to the cities
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.760]   or let's say the labor optimization,
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.000]   industrialization happened more in the '60s, '70s,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.120]   and '80s with outsourcing
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.120]   where whole cities kind of hollowed out
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.560]   as manufacturing went offshore and became more productive
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.680]   and it created these crises
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.120]   that we're still dealing with today
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.200]   with the opioid crisis, with the populism crisis.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.140]   It really restructured the country.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:14.800]   The internet didn't do that in work,
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.340]   but it did change.
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.000]   It created some new jobs, it got rid of some jobs.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.540]   - Back to our allostasis in the marbles,
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:22.700]   what I'm hearing is that AI is going to take the marbles
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.000]   and disperse them and they're gonna come back together
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.720]   in potentially a very different way,
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.720]   but they're still gonna be on the same table.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:33.320]   Whereas industrialization knocked the marbles off the table
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.880]   and then it took 45 years to build another table
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.520]   and then set them down on another table.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.440]   - Yeah, and there's still people left on the ground.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.280]   - Exactly.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.320]   - I think that's exactly right.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:45.160]   Obviously, going back to early in our conversation,
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.560]   the right thing to do here
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.480]   is just to see what Jocko Willink does with AI
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:52.520]   'cause he's the Navy SEAL that is really good at adapting.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.020]   So just whatever Jocko does,
[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:58.780]   then that's my sage for all things AI.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.680]   All right, well, we've gone far afield,
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.140]   but I always like when I have you here
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:05.800]   to shoot the breeze on online culture and what's going on.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.940]   But Brad, it's always a pleasure.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.780]   The book is "Master of Change."
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:10.120]   You know, I haven't read the subtitle yet.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.560]   Let me give everyone the subtitle.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.020]   "How to Excel When Everything is Changing, Including You."
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.520]   A subtitle I like, by the way.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.740]   - Yeah, that subtitle, it's a funny story
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:21.660]   'cause I know that you think about this a lot
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:22.920]   with your books.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.520]   We really were struggling with the subtitle
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:28.240]   and I was on a call with my publishing team
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.440]   and one of the editors, my main editor,
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.440]   did a really good job and she's just like,
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.280]   "Just forget about everything that we've talked about.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.240]   "Like, if you were to go up to a friend
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.060]   "and pitch them the book, the classic elevator pitch,
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:42.900]   "what would it be?"
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.060]   And it's not like I hadn't thought about this,
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.980]   but for whatever reason, I'm like,
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.380]   I would basically be like, "Look, dude," or,
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:52.460]   "Look, you think that you are you,
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.540]   "but you're always changing, yet you are you.
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.840]   "So how do you think about yourself
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.960]   "when everything's always changing, including you?"
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.640]   That's what this book's gonna help with.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.580]   - Yeah. - And she's like,
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:01.420]   "There you go." - There you go.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.240]   - That's the subtitle.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.160]   Someone write that down.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.100]   - I like it, I like it.
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.120]   So "Masters of Change," the subtitle is,
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.400]   "Hey, dude, you're always changing."
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.560]   - Well, it's not just, "Hey, dude."
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.960]   It could be, "Hey, sister."
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.160]   - It's gonna say, "Snap" in parentheses.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.000]   - Yeah.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:14.840]   - Yeah.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.700]   - No, a little bit more refined.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.480]   But yeah, I mean, that's the book.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.360]   And I guess the you could be, as we talked about,
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.280]   applied broadly, it could be you as a person,
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.040]   but it could also be a family unit, an organization,
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.440]   or these big cultural changes.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.040]   - Excellent, so what else should people know
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.560]   about finding Brad Stolberg?
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.600]   If they wanna know all things Brad, where should they look?
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.520]   - Yeah, the best places are my website,
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.280]   which is just my name, bradstolberg.com.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.480]   And then I am on Instagram,
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.480]   probably more frequently than Twitter now.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.160]   That was another topic that we didn't talk about,
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.040]   but Twitter changed quite a bit,
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.580]   and I changed where I am on the internet along with that.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.720]   But also in the spirit of this conversation,
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.240]   the best way to go deep on my most recent thinking
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.680]   is spare yourself the social media and the internet
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.760]   and just read or listen to the book.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.680]   - Right, so you're saying we don't need to see
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:06.140]   your Instagram stories about your cold plunge.
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.280]   We can just go straight to the book itself.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.120]   - There you go.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.240]   Don't worry, I don't cold plunge, but just read the book.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.620]   Stay off Instagram so you don't see everyone else's stories
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.120]   about their cold plunge.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.240]   - All right, Brad, thanks for coming.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.000]   - All right, Cal, let's go cold plunge together.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:19.920]   - All right, so there we have it.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.800]   That was my conversation with Brad Stolberg.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.080]   If you like that, please leave a review
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.480]   or subscribe to this podcast.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.800]   That does really help us spread the word.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.280]   And otherwise, that's all we have for today.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.680]   So we will be back next week
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:39.080]   with a new episode of the podcast.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.880]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.200]   Hey, it's Cal here.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.600]   If you like this interview with Brad Stolberg,
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:51.440]   I think you'll also really like episode 253
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.040]   when I interview Laura Vanderkam
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.680]   about making the most out of your time.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.800]   Check this out.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.400]   This is more about what they did with the time
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.920]   that was outside of work is what impacted
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.680]   how they felt about their schedule.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.880]   Not that in order to do salsa dancing,
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.880]   they were working on average three hours less
