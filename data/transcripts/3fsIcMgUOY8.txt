[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500]   Hi.
[00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.220]   In this video, we're going to be having
[00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.740]   a look at how we can deploy a Flask API using Google's Cloud
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.700]   Platform, or GCP.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.980]   So it's actually a very simple process,
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.140]   and we're going to jump straight into it.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.780]   So we want to go to Google.
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.980]   And the first thing I'm going to do is actually go to the GCP
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.780]   console.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:28.580]   So we just write gcp console, and we just click here.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.580]   And that should bring you through to this page.
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.500]   If you already have an account, if you don't,
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.820]   you will need to obviously create an account.
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.860]   But once you have your account, you come over here.
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.080]   You can either come up here to create a project,
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.900]   or you just click on this button here, Create Project.
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.380]   And I'm just going to call mine Flask API.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.260]   You will need to set up a billing account
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.660]   if you haven't already.
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.260]   Mine is already set, so I don't need to do anything there.
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.700]   And I just come to Create.
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.500]   That will take a moment for it to actually create a project.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.540]   But once it is done, we will see we have this project ID here.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.340]   We're going to need to keep that.
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.720]   So I'm just going to copy it now,
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.540]   so we're going to be using it later.
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.940]   And we need to initialize the Cloud Build API.
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.460]   So we come up here.
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:32.060]   And we just want to click on this first link here.
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.460]   And what we do is enable this API for this specific project.
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.060]   So you need to make sure at the top
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.660]   here you have your Flask API project set.
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.660]   So again, that will take a moment to actually install.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.180]   And the final thing that we need to set up
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.580]   is we need to install the GCP SDK.
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.200]   So all I'm going to type into Google is GCP SDK install.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.500]   And you can see, OK, we have this first link here,
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.700]   installing Cloud SDK.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.100]   Click on that.
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.740]   And you just follow through.
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.620]   These instructions are pretty basic for whichever
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.780]   OS you're using.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.380]   So for me, I'm on Mac.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.940]   Click here, install this.
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.180]   And then I have the G Cloud SDK on my terminal.
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.020]   So I'm going to switch over to VS Code.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.500]   And we'll take a look at what all this actually
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.580]   looks like in our code and actually creating our API
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.540]   and deploying it.
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.220]   OK, so I'm in VS Code now.
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.140]   I have this little directory.
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.460]   It's just an API.
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.380]   We created this in the previous video series and an article.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.700]   So you can have a look at that if you want.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.660]   But the content of this isn't particularly important.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.220]   I just want to note we're importing
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.260]   some data from some files here.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.620]   And we have these two endpoints, users and locations.
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.020]   That's really it.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.980]   There isn't-- there's nothing else particularly
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.820]   important in here.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.500]   It's just a Flask API.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.900]   So what I want to do is open a terminal window here.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.060]   So I'm assuming my base environment here.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.820]   And I've already installed the Cloud SDK.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.940]   So that means I can use these G Cloud calls.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.100]   So I'm going to write gcloud app create project.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.620]   And I need this to be equal to the project
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.500]   ID that I copied before.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.500]   So I have abstract ring 230710.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.100]   And this will just create an app inside the project
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.060]   that we created in the console before.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.460]   So I'm going to Enter.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.500]   And you also need to select the region that you
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.540]   are going to be using.
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.100]   For me, I'm just Europe West.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.300]   So I'll put 11.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.700]   And that will create the App Engine app
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.540]   in that chosen project, which is an abstract ring, which
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.820]   we called Flask API.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.860]   So this is the ID of that project.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.820]   The actual name is Flask API.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.100]   So the app is now created.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.260]   Please use gcloud app deploy to deploy your first app.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.500]   Now, before we actually do that, we
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.740]   need to install the App Engine extension for Python,
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.940]   because we're on Python right now.
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.260]   And by default, the Python version of that
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.420]   is not installed or included.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:08.860]   So we need to do gcloud components install App Engine.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.860]   Sorry, I realize you probably can't see.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:19.660]   So gcloud components install App Engine Python.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.220]   OK, that's it.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.940]   And we see-- so in my case, I've already
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.660]   installed the App Engine Python in my gcloud SDK.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.460]   So it's just saying I already have it installed.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.780]   If you just install it, it will install for you.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.500]   So that's everything we need for deploying our app.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.980]   I think the last few things we need to include here--
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.380]   so we have our actual script, our API script.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.540]   But we do need a few other things as well.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.140]   So I want to-- before we actually try and deploy our API,
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.620]   we should just test that it actually works.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.780]   So we can simulate the same environment
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.380]   that the App Engine will be running our API within
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.180]   by using something called Goonicorn, or Goonicorn, maybe.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.340]   So to install that, we just pip install Goonicorn.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.340]   I already have it installed, so I'm not going to.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.700]   Do it again.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.940]   And once you have installed that,
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.900]   you just need to write Goonicorn b.
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.460]   You select a host port.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.620]   So I'm going to go with 8,000.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:43.820]   And then you need to write the name of your Python API file.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.060]   So mine is main.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.660]   And then if you come down here, you
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.900]   can see that we have this app run.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.500]   So where did I define app?
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.700]   It should be at the top here.
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.780]   So app, which is the Flask app.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.900]   So after this colon here, we need to include that.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:08.740]   And that will initialize and run our API.
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.460]   Now you can see here--
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.380]   let's make this a little smaller--
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.420]   you can see here that we have the actual location.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.820]   So let's open that.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.460]   And if we just open it on this first page,
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.420]   we will see that it just says not found.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.500]   Now, this isn't actually a problem.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.900]   It's because we only have the two endpoints, users,
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.820]   and locations.
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.780]   So let's open that, and you'll see
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.700]   that we get this JSON response, which is what we'd expect.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.980]   Now, the content of that is not important.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.540]   We just want to see that, OK, the API is actually
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.460]   running when we run it with Goonicorn.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.300]   So that's good.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.620]   So let's switch back over to VS Code.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.940]   We'll stop that from running.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.540]   And that means that the core of the API
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.900]   will run in the Cloud App Engine environment.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.660]   So that's good.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.100]   The only thing is, OK, we have our Python environment here.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.500]   So I'm using Python 3.8 down here.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.420]   And up here, I have a few modules
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.980]   I've imported as well.
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.580]   So Flask, Flask RESTful, Pandas.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.620]   How is the App Engine going to know that we're
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.500]   using this environment?
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.180]   It doesn't.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.740]   We need to tell the App Engine what our environment looks
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.340]   like and what environment it should set up.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.980]   So to do that, we need to use two files.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.940]   So we'll come over here, and then create a new file.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.100]   And I'm going to call it app.yaml.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.500]   And inside here, we just want to set our runtime.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:09:00.660]   So the runtime is just going to be Python 3.8.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.420]   That's it.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.180]   Nothing else is needed there.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.980]   Now I'm going to create another new file.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.420]   And I'm going to call it requirements.txt.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.220]   And in here, I need to write which modules we're using,
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.140]   which packages.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.260]   Ours is pretty simple.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.620]   So Flask, Flask RESTful, and we also have Pandas.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.660]   Now save that.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.420]   And beyond that, there isn't anything else.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.980]   So we can switch back over to the terminal window.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.340]   And we can now do the gcloud deploy.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.740]   So we write gcloud app deploy.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.980]   And you see also just within the API folder,
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.780]   so this is the folder that ordered
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.260]   directory that contains all of these files here.
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.580]   Deploy.
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.500]   And this will take a moment.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.140]   I'm going to tell it where I want to deploy.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.780]   Deploy 11.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.180]   OK, and this is actually quite useful.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.740]   So I've got this error that's popped up
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.060]   because I am currently in another project which
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:20.980]   no longer exists.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.580]   So I'm getting this error.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.940]   So I need to make sure that I'm trying to deploy
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.860]   to the right project.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.260]   So I just write gcloud app deploy.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.300]   I can specify the app.yaml.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.180]   And I just write project equals.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.260]   And then in here, I need the project name from before.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.460]   So I'm just going to go and copy that again.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.380]   So it comes here.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:53.940]   So it's this abstract ring.
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.420]   And I just write in here abstract ring.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.780]   OK, now run that.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.380]   That should come up with this here.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.580]   So we have come down here.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.940]   We have the descriptor and then the target project.
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.940]   So it's correct.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.100]   We're now going to the correct place.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.220]   And this URL here is where we will be deploying the API to.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.940]   So I'm going to click Continue, Yes.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:37.460]   And this can take a little bit of time for it to run.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.500]   So just wait a moment.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.780]   One thing that's actually pretty useful
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:50.380]   is when you first deploy, gcloud will create this gcloud ignore
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.140]   file.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.540]   It's like a git ignore.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.340]   And in here, it will just ignore the typical things
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.460]   that you do actually want to ignore.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.580]   So you have pycache here, which has been created up here.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:08.380]   So we don't need to exclude that from the upload by default,
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.900]   which is useful, I think.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.980]   So see how that is going.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.860]   Still uploading.
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:21.260]   OK, so good to go.
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:27.620]   I'm going to copy this, open it in the browser.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.020]   And we should see-- so what we saw before with this,
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.660]   we should end up seeing the same.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.860]   So we'll go first to that address.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:43.140]   We get that not found that we saw before, so it's expected.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:49.480]   And if we just go to Users, there we go.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:55.780]   So we see that our API is now deployed to Google Cloud.
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.540]   We can also see that over here.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:06.740]   So if I refresh, we should see the requests pop up over here.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.540]   Or they will do, eventually.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.540]   So this will give you a summary of how many requests
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.380]   are made to your API.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.820]   That's it for this video.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.460]   I hope it's been useful.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.980]   And I will see you in the next one.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.540]   Bye.
