[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   Today we wrap up year number eight
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.160]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast, which is amazing.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.080]   The time has passed by so quickly.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.760]   The run of this podcast recently dawned on me
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.000]   when I read an email that we got from a young man
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.240]   who said that he started listening to the podcast
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.800]   shortly after he was converted,
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.160]   and now he's entering seminary and still listening.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.840]   It's amazing, I had to stop and compute that for a moment,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.320]   the kind of duration of someone converted
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.800]   and then entering seminary.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.600]   So we've been doing this a while.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.840]   Here we are finishing up year number eight,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.400]   and as we do, I wanted to give you just a little glance
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.240]   at the numbers of where the podcast is at right now.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.360]   And over those eight years,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.400]   we have released 1,600 episodes in the podcast,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.880]   starting back on John Piper's birthday on January 11th, 2013.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.600]   That was episode number one.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.180]   And then with all of the special and unnumbered episodes,
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.160]   and then obviously the ones that are numbered,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.160]   that's a tally of 1,600 episodes to date.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.200]   Incredible.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.800]   And on those episodes,
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.800]   when you look at Pastor John's episodes,
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.320]   the ones where he's the one I'm talking with,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.380]   no guest episodes, Pastor John transcripts alone
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.380]   represent 1.7 million words of content.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.320]   Just to put that into perspective,
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.640]   imagine the entire Lord of the Rings series,
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.100]   read them once and then read them a second time,
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.640]   and then read them a third time.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.820]   That's the equivalent of the word count
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.960]   of John Piper's episodes on APJ.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.660]   Oh, and you'd also have to read "The Hobbit"
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.120]   three times as well.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.680]   1.7 million words.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.500]   It's an incredible amount of content.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.260]   But of course, this podcast is meant
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.880]   to be heard with the ears.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.440]   And if you tally up all the plays on all those episodes,
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.440]   APJ episodes have been listened to 180 million times.
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.380]   That's an average of over 112,000 plays per episode.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.560]   That's so encouraging.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.840]   And not only do the episodes get listened to
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.400]   as we release them,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.200]   but people regularly access those episodes
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.080]   like an archive of on-demand pastoral answers, really,
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.280]   when needs and questions arise in your life.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.000]   So I can't tell you how gratifying it is
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.360]   to invest my life on a project
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.920]   that has such a long-term use
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.120]   and a value to so many.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.240]   So thanks for reading,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.260]   thanks for listening,
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.320]   and thanks for watching.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.200]   Yes, watching.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.360]   As I study the numbers,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.840]   what strikes me is the growth we've seen in YouTube.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.880]   Yes, YouTube.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.720]   As many of you know,
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.040]   for the past few years now,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.740]   we've released each APJ episode as a video in YouTube.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.400]   In 2019, those episodes accounted for 6.7 million plays.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.460]   Just shy of 7 million plays.
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.920]   That number has doubled this year.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.440]   In 2020, we saw 13.2 million plays,
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.660]   just in YouTube.
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.320]   And it continues to be a growing platform for our podcast.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.000]   It'll be interesting to see what the Lord has in store
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.080]   in 2021 for APJ on YouTube.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.920]   And if that's you,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.240]   if you're listening to or watching this episode right now,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.140]   thank you for investing so much of your attention
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.320]   into our DG YouTube channel.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.160]   It's super encouraging.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.960]   Well, there's so much to be encouraged about
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.120]   as we close out the year.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.880]   And recently, Pastor John visited the DG offices
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.360]   in Minneapolis in order to ponder the meaning of 2020
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.040]   and to talk about why we released
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.320]   so many teaching resources.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.160]   And I wanted to play for you what he said.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.340]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.800]   - It may seem strange to you
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.320]   as I ponder the meaning of 2020
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.080]   and look back over pandemic
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.920]   and political intrigue and tension
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.440]   and all kinds of outrage and division inside
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.840]   and outside the church and natural disasters.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.840]   As I look back over this extraordinary year,
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   I find myself reacting perhaps differently than others
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.800]   because I feel like I've been living in another world,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.360]   namely the world of Ephesians,
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.920]   a reality with election
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.260]   before the foundation of the world unto holiness,
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.160]   the reality of predestination unto sonship
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.800]   through Jesus Christ to the praise of the glory of God,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.480]   the reality of redemption by the blood of the Son of God
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.560]   for the forgiveness of our trespasses,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.360]   the reality of sovereign God reaching into my dead heart
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.200]   and giving me life,
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.520]   the reality of sealing with the Holy Spirit,
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.200]   the reality that Paul describes in chapter two
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.160]   about being separated from the Messiah
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.840]   and cut off from the commonwealth of Israel
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.700]   and strangers to the covenants of promise
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.840]   and without hope in the world.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.520]   And I step back and say,
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.160]   that's another world besides the 2020
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.760]   that people are talking about.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.960]   So what hit me,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.400]   I was reading Hebrews the other day.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.120]   You come to chapter five and it says,
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.120]   "By this time you ought to be teachers."
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.280]   Look, everybody, all Christians,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.320]   "By this time you ought to be teachers."
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.760]   And I felt like nobody knows the world of Ephesians
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.840]   in the world, in the church,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.960]   who knows what it means to be elect and predestined
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.240]   and redeemed and sealed and born again
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.200]   and participants in the promises of Israel
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.760]   and part of the commonwealth of the people of God
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.120]   who even functions in those categories.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   And it hit me, what we need is a tidal wave of teachers.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.560]   I mean, as Paul looked out
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   on an empire of ignorance about Christianity,
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.000]   do you remember what he did in Ephesians?
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.800]   When he got to Ephesus,
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.920]   it says he preached in the synagogue for three months
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.120]   arguing about these things
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.720]   because they didn't know anything about them.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.280]   And they kicked him out.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.360]   And you know what he did next?
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.600]   He holed up for two years.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.480]   And it says, every day,
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.240]   every day for two years, he teaches.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.880]   And the result, all Asia heard the word of the Lord.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.360]   So I find myself here at the end of 2020,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.040]   looking out over a sea of ignorance.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.440]   And I think of the election and I think of the pandemic
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.880]   and I think of the natural disasters.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   Those are bubbles popping on a sea of ignorance.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.880]   And everything in me says,
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.520]   I wanna be a part of a spirit anointed movement
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.840]   of teaching in this world.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.080]   I wanna fill Jerusalem with my teaching.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.160]   I wanna fill America, fill the nations with teaching
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.600]   because there's no other way people could make
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.120]   any informed thoughts, inclinations, decisions,
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.320]   loves about the truth if they don't know what it is.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.720]   And so here I am, the offices of desiring God say,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.480]   I am so glad that's what we do.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.080]   We exist to bring people to glorify God
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.960]   by making them satisfied more in God than anything
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.120]   by teaching and teaching and teaching
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.640]   about his truth and worth and beauty,
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.640]   all based on the Bible.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.360]   Many of you know all about that.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.720]   Others of you are brand new to us.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.240]   We exist because of your partnership.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.360]   If you're a veteran and you love what we do,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.800]   if you're brand new and that just rings true to you,
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.080]   my invitation here at the end of the year
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.960]   is simply join us as a financial partner.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.320]   Whether you give a little or you give a lot,
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.280]   whether you give once or you give monthly,
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.480]   whatever you do, if that rings true,
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.480]   I invite you to join us.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.120]   And as we close the year, just take heart,
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.600]   take heart because God has said,
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.480]   I am God and there is no other.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.680]   I am God and there's none like me.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.680]   Declaring the end from the beginning
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.560]   and from ancient times, things not yet done,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.920]   saying my counsel will stand
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.080]   and I will accomplish all my purpose.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.640]   He's gonna do it.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.800]   The world just needs to know.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.880]   They need teaching.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.360]   - Exactly, the world needs a lot more teaching
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.560]   and that's one reason why we are up to 1600 APJ episodes
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.200]   to date and counting, Lord willing with many more to come
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   and 180 million episode plays all time.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.480]   As you might imagine, this podcast is not free to make
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.320]   and distribute and promote around the world.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.680]   It only happens through the joyful investment
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.200]   of our ministry partners and that can be you.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.120]   As we near the end of year eight,
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.240]   you can support us for the first time
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   or you can extend your support to us
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.960]   at desiringgod.org/donate.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.560]   That's desiringgod.org/donate.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.200]   And speaking of God's truth and worth and beauty,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.000]   all based on the Bible, on Friday we launch a new year
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.560]   and that means many of us reset our Bible reading plans.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.840]   Pastor John has a Bible reading plan he likes
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.680]   and I'll tell you which one it is on Friday.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.600]   And I'll ask Pastor John, how can we prepare
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.800]   for the sustained discipline and energy it will take
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.000]   to read the entire Bible through the year ahead?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.240]   He's back in the studio with me on Friday for that.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.760]   Let's do this again.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.480]   Let's do this another eight years, another 1600 episodes,
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.560]   another 180 million plays, why not?
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.640]   Lord willing, we can in a second tidal wave of teaching
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.080]   with you alongside us.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.240]   So would you please pray for us
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.840]   as our labors enter the new year?
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.560]   Pray for Pastor John and myself.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.440]   We would really appreciate your prayers,
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.680]   not only financial support,
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.640]   but your prayer support is really important to us.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.800]   And with that, year number eight comes to an end.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.120]   On Friday we launch year number nine.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.880]   I'm Tony Reinke, we'll see you in 2021.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:18.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
