[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400]   All right, we'll go on to the next question here.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.200]   This is from Cal Fan.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.100]   All right, so this must be someone who went to school in California.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.400]   How do you maintain a healthy body posture while being at a computer
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   throughout the day?
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.500]   Don't be at a computer all throughout the day.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.500]   It's much easier than, you know, having to buy one of those
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.300]   Twitch streamer style jet engine, jet fighter pilot gamer chairs
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.100]   to try to get your posture just right.
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.800]   Just don't be at your computer all day.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.200]   In response to an earlier question this episode, I suggested
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.000]   anytime you have actual non-trivial contemplative thinking to do
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.500]   do it on foot.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.800]   Just have that rule and you're going to do better thinking
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.200]   but you're also going to be up a lot more.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.700]   So that's the key.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.700]   Make the posture, I mean have good posture, but make it somewhat
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.900]   irrelevant because you're not at your chair long enough at a stretch
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.100]   that non-perfect posture is going to cause a problem.
