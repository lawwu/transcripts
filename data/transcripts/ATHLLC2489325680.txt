[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.360]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.160]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.400]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.120]   and I've recently gotten a ton of questions from you,
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.160]   and even from friends and past colleagues
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.280]   about time management, delegation,
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.700]   and specifically about hiring and working
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.560]   with an assistant or EA.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.760]   So I thought it would be a great idea
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.160]   to invite my friend and founder of Levels, Sam Korkos,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.220]   who is an absolute expert at delegation,
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.260]   to talk about delegation broadly,
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.980]   as well as the entire process
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.100]   from assessing the need to hire an EA,
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.240]   ways to hire one, how to work with them,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.520]   and some challenges that may come up.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.140]   Believe it or not, Sam has four EAs,
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.120]   including one he's worked with for over 10 years,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.640]   and yet somehow has never actually had
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.760]   a synchronous one-on-one direct conversation with her.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.160]   In addition to all that, Sam shares my passion
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.360]   for using software, automation, services,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.700]   shortcuts, and now AI to outsource, onboard,
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.760]   and optimize so much of his life,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.640]   and he is so good at it.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.200]   So I hope that this is really a masterclass
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.080]   in all things delegation and focusing on what matters.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.040]   And if you noticed the length of this episode
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160]   and thought, wow, that's way too long,
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.880]   I tried to edit out as much as I could,
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.560]   but I wanted to leave all the good stuff,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.480]   and there was just so much.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.840]   So my goal is that even if you listen to it
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.360]   in its entirety at 1x speed,
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.720]   I think you'll save more than that much time,
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.540]   if not 10, 100, or even 1,000 times more time
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020]   by putting some of what you learn into place.
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.620]   And to help with that, I worked with the team at Oceans,
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.060]   which is a company I use
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.440]   to find my amazing assistant, Pasani,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.740]   to put together a guide that covers 10 tactical steps
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.180]   you need to take before, during,
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.180]   and after hiring an assistant
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.980]   to create a paradigm shift in the way you work.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.220]   It covers everything from changing your mindset
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.020]   to training yourself to delegate and more.
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.140]   If you wanna check it out,
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.980]   it's totally free, just go to the link in the show notes
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.920]   or go to allthehacks.com/delegate.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.800]   Or if you're interested in getting an assistant,
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.380]   you can check out oceansxyz.com,
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.980]   and I'm pretty sure that if you tell them
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.060]   you heard about it here, they will hook you up with a deal.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.700]   Okay, I am so excited for this conversation with Sam,
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.940]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.460]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.500]   when I spoke to chef David Chang
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.660]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.020]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen,
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.500]   but one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.820]   I'll admit, I was a skeptic at first,
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.380]   but after getting a full set
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.420]   of microwave cookware from Anyday,
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.860]   I'm a total convert,
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.100]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.900]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.940]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave,
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.260]   and honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.940]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.300]   The cookware is 100% plastic-free,
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.060]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.740]   all in the same dish
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.180]   that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven-safe too.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.860]   And if you need a recipe suggestion
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.660]   to kick off your Anyday adventure,
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.420]   I highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.340]   It is so good.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.780]   And if you haven't checked out
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.020]   the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year,
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.700]   you have to check it out.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.140]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.420]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.420]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.380]   Sam, thanks for being here.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.220]   - Glad to be here.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.660]   - I wanna start this conversation off
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.260]   just talking at a high level
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.380]   on why delegation is actually important for really anyone.
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.020]   - I think it's probably the most important skill
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.660]   to develop as a leader,
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.540]   to be able to increase your capacity,
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.260]   to be able to deliver more value.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.060]   The amount of time that you have in your life is finite.
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.740]   And so the only way at a certain point in your career
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.860]   that you can deliver more value
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.420]   is to learn how to delegate to other people,
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.660]   to be able to extend the number of hours
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.660]   that can be contributed to a certain initiative.
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.740]   So ultimately, everyone who intends to reach some level
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.500]   of success in their life needs to learn how to delegate.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.180]   That's probably the highest level explanation.
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.300]   - The only pushback I'll give you is you said a leader,
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.980]   and I guess we could think about leader more broadly.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.300]   The average person listening might think,
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.340]   oh, this is a skill that's relevant
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.700]   for people who are running companies or managers.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.980]   And I would just say, you'll learn this soon enough,
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.660]   but with two kids, I feel like time shrinks
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.220]   because there are more responsibilities at home
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.140]   and it can also become a really important skill
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.340]   for anyone beyond just leaders.
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.580]   And if you expand the definition of leaders bright enough,
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.300]   then I guess it includes everyone.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.380]   - Yeah, and it really depends on how abstract
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.820]   we wanna go with this, but in many ways,
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.820]   you're delegating the labor of growing crops to a farmer
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.500]   and then you're buying their service,
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.260]   you're buying the product from them.
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.060]   So it's just a little, you're already delegating
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.380]   many, many parts of your life,
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.060]   whether you realize it or not.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.260]   And so in order to achieve anything bigger
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.620]   than what you would just be able to do by yourself
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.220]   with limited capacity,
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.460]   you have to be able to learn how to work with other people.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.100]   And that's truly what delegation is.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.300]   - It's funny, I was gonna ask you
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.020]   about some of the benefits you've seen in your life.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.340]   And now I'm like, well, one benefit is
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.420]   you don't have to be a farmer.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.100]   (all laughing)
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.740]   But how do you think, if you rewind and look at now,
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.380]   becoming great at delegation benefits your life
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.060]   and changes your life in what way?
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.420]   - You can do more things.
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.340]   Often when I'm coaching people that I work with
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.340]   or talking to friends who are struggling with these things,
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.340]   one of the biggest challenges that I found
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.700]   of trying to get people to measure their time,
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.900]   to put things in their calendar and to measure their time,
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.540]   I think the biggest reason why people don't want to do it
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.860]   is that really there's an existential dread
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.940]   that comes with it.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.460]   When you have this list of all the places
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.140]   you wanna go on vacation in your life,
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.340]   it's like, I wanna go to India,
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.780]   I wanna go to the Bahamas,
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.860]   I wanna go here, I wanna go there.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.620]   It's like, wow, this would be so amazing.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.740]   And it's like, great, let's look at the rest of your life
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.420]   and how much time you have.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.620]   And it looks like you get to pick four of those.
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.620]   That can be a really unpleasant conversation.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.140]   And so I think to recognize
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.500]   that you have a finite amount of time,
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.980]   and if you want to deliver on anything of value,
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.620]   you have to figure out how to get better at delegating.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.980]   And it doesn't mean that you have to pick one thing
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.820]   or the other.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.940]   You don't have to say,
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.340]   I want to achieve all of these things.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.420]   But if you wanna do something like build a piece of software
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.060]   that you sell to people,
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.140]   unless you think that you can do all of it,
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.740]   if you plot out the timeline
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.140]   of you doing all of these things,
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.860]   like doing a podcast,
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.460]   some people just do it all themselves,
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.100]   which is totally fine.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.780]   Some people hand off the editing, they delegate that.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.900]   Some people hand off the promotion, the distribution,
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.460]   they hand off a lot of different pieces.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.300]   And so you just have to figure out
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.820]   how far do you wanna take it
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.140]   and how much leverage can you get
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.620]   by delegating to other people.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.380]   - And if we push in this kind of like product manager way
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.500]   of the five whys,
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.180]   which I'm guessing you're familiar with,
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.460]   it's like, well, you have more time,
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.300]   you can do more things,
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.340]   what's the real benefit?
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.620]   Do you feel more fulfilled in how you spend your days?
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.780]   Are you happier?
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.860]   - One of the major aspects,
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.620]   and this is coincidentally something
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.420]   I was talking to somebody about today,
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.260]   one of the major benefits of delegation
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.700]   is just learning how to better manage your energy.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.020]   And this is sort of a,
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.700]   I don't know if it's a woo-woo thing to say,
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.060]   but there are things that take your energy
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.380]   and there are things that give you energy.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.020]   I think we've all experienced that
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.780]   of things that you're excited to do
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.460]   and things that as you're doing them,
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.820]   it's just crushing your soul.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.380]   And you can do some of those soul crushing things
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.220]   for a little while,
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.380]   but eventually you burn out.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.500]   And this is maybe a controversial statement,
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.780]   but burnout is a choice.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.700]   You choose to do things that you do not like to do.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.020]   Everything is a choice.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.380]   Your job is a choice.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.900]   Everything is a choice.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.980]   And you can choose whether or not you do it,
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.420]   whether you hand it to somebody else,
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.180]   whether you find something else to do.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.020]   And so the why of delegation from that lens
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.500]   is you're choosing a path to do a job
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.980]   that requires a daily mode of operation
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.060]   that is sucking the life force out of you.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.780]   And so delegation is interesting
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.300]   because oftentimes the things that you find soul crushing
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.900]   are things that somebody else actually really enjoys doing.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.540]   And then they look at what you're doing.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.060]   Like in my world, I really like coding.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.220]   I like programming.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.100]   I like sitting in a dark room in a cave
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.220]   and just writing code for like 12 straight hours.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.860]   And there are people who look at that and say,
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.900]   "That is insane.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.660]   I could never do that."
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.460]   And then I look at what they do, which is, I don't know,
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.300]   sales.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.500]   It's like, "I could never do that.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.580]   It is like my worst life is doing sales calls."
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.780]   But that's what they enjoy.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.940]   And there's no right or wrong answer here,
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.100]   but being able to delegate different skills
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.060]   for what different people want
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.180]   allows you to control more of your energy.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.260]   And it allows you to have more stamina
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.620]   and reduce the risk of burnout.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.500]   That's one of the major benefits.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.620]   - When you say it like that,
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.980]   I can't imagine someone listening is like,
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.100]   "Oh, I shouldn't do more of that."
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.940]   Right?
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.780]   Like, "I want to spend more time
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.900]   on the things I enjoy in life."
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.740]   - Yeah.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.740]   - I love to highlight businesses
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.500]   that are doing things a better way
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   so that you can live a better life.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.620]   And that's why I love our sponsor today, Mint Mobile.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.180]   For example, a few months ago,
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.260]   I got an email about our AuPair's phone line saying,
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.220]   "It turns out you don't need unlimited data.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.940]   On average, you're only using about seven gigs a month.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.860]   So switching to the 15 gig plan
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.940]   will be fine and save you money.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.100]   And you can always upgrade your plan back if you need to."
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.940]   Who does that?
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.460]   I never get emails like that, but I love it.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.340]   On top of that, Mint Mobile has ditched retail stores
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.100]   and all those overhead costs,
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.380]   and instead sells their phone plans online
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.460]   and passes those savings on to you.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.100]   And right now, Mint Mobile has wireless plans
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.220]   starting at $15 a month.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.460]   That's unlimited talk, text, plus data for $15 a month.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.420]   All Mint's plans are on the nation's largest 5G network,
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.300]   and we've been so happy with that coverage
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.500]   and how much we've saved since switching.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.660]   To get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.780]   and get the plan shipped to your door for free,
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.100]   go to allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.020]   That's allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.620]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.780]   at allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.020]   Additional taxes, fees, and restrictions apply.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.740]   See Mint Mobile for details.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.700]   (air whooshing)
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.900]   Taking care of your health isn't always easy,
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.900]   but it should at least be simple.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.420]   That's why for the last two years,
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.220]   I've been drinking AG1 every day, no exceptions,
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.900]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.340]   It's just one scoop mixed in water once a day, every day,
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.100]   and it makes me feel so energized
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.780]   and ready to take on whatever comes my way.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.620]   That's because each serving of AG1
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.540]   delivers my daily dose of vitamins,
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.700]   minerals, pre and probiotics, and more.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.060]   It's a powerful, healthy habit
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.980]   that's also powerfully simple.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.780]   And one of the reasons I love AG1
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.580]   is that healthy aging shouldn't feel complicated.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.540]   The thought of taking multiple supplements
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.980]   or mixing and matching pills and powders every day
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.660]   sounds exhausting, but just one scoop of AG1
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.380]   covers my nutrient gaps and supports my mental
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.180]   and physical health without a lot of hassle.
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.780]   In just 60 seconds,
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.060]   I mix it up with some cold water every morning,
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.700]   add a few ice cubes because it's so good cold,
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.140]   and I know I'm giving my body what it needs
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.140]   and setting up sustainable habits for the long run.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.900]   If there's one product to recommend
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.900]   to elevate your health, it's AG1,
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.660]   and that's why I've partnered with them for so long.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.380]   So if you wanna take ownership of your health,
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.460]   start with AG1, try AG1, and get a free one-year supply
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.140]   of vitamin D3 and K2 and five free AG1 travel packs
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.180]   with your first purchase exclusively
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.580]   at allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.340]   That's allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.500]   Check it out.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.740]   Why do you think more people don't get good at this?
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.980]   Why aren't more people doing it
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.860]   in their personal life and their work life?
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.820]   - It's an interesting question.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.780]   I can say there are many different reasons,
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.180]   some of which are more valid than others.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.180]   Just from personal experience talking to people
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.140]   who've struggled with this,
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.020]   I would say one is some degree of insecurity
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.060]   where they feel like they don't like doing this thing,
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.460]   and so they assume nobody else likes doing this thing.
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.260]   So they feel a little bit of guilt handing this task
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.500]   to somebody else who's also gonna hate doing it.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.300]   But that's not necessarily the case.
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.860]   In fact, in my experience, it's very often not the case.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.380]   I think some of it also comes from a place of insecurity
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.380]   around some imposter syndrome of who am I
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.940]   to tell somebody else what to do with their time?
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.740]   And eventually, you just have to get over that,
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.740]   and you have to learn that the only way to get better
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.820]   at how to achieve whatever it is you wanna achieve
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.460]   is to get more comfortable
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.460]   handing off these tasks to other people.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.180]   Some other recent examples is they feel like
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.620]   these are things that must be done,
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.700]   and they don't have the resources internally
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.260]   to be able to hand them off to other people.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.740]   If what your company really needs is sales,
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.540]   and you hate doing sales,
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.860]   but it is definitely the most important thing,
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.260]   and you can't hire other people
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.940]   'cause you don't have the resources for it,
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.300]   then you might just have to grind through it
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.140]   for a little while.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.060]   But I think what's important
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.300]   is figuring out what your exit strategy is.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.180]   If it's not the thing that you're excited about,
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.540]   you should figure out what the script is.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.860]   If it really is ROI positive,
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.900]   eventually you'll be able to hire somebody to do it.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.060]   There are a lot of different reasons
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.260]   why people struggle with it,
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.860]   but in my experience, one of the things that I try to do,
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.460]   I do once a quarter, a think week,
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.460]   which I just stole from Bill Gates,
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.340]   where I take one week off from communications,
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.780]   and I just think, and read, and write.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.740]   And I found that's the right cadence for me
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.700]   to get pulled out of the hyperactive hive mind
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.220]   of work and the day-to-day,
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.940]   and see the whole forest and not just the trees.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.900]   And so when people are in that mode
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.300]   of constantly churning, and grinding, and grinding,
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.140]   they often lose the big picture of,
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.580]   should we even be doing this thing at all?
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.180]   Often the answer is just no.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.700]   It's having that space to zoom out
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.420]   and think about what your major priorities are
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.380]   is really important.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.100]   - I'm gonna go back through a few of the things you said.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.260]   So when you talked about the imposter syndrome,
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.420]   one of the things that made me think
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.660]   was about your example about farmers,
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.900]   which was if you ship a package,
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.820]   you are inherently telling someone
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.860]   they need to go and deliver your package.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.340]   And I think maybe the more we can normalize the fact
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.380]   that we're delegating lots of things already, right?
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.820]   You know, you buy something at the grocery store,
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.380]   someone has to restock that thing, order that thing.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.420]   So that was one thing that just made me realize,
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.980]   well, I'm delegating a lot.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.140]   And so if I'm uncomfortable doing it,
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:47.980]   I should just get over it.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.300]   Like, it's just already happened.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.980]   And I think that's helpful.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.580]   I think part of it is not feeling like
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.540]   you can tell someone what to do.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.940]   And part of it is feeling like maybe I don't deserve this
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.020]   or it's too elitist.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.020]   You know, I don't wanna be the one
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.740]   that tells my family and friends
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.700]   to interface with my assistant.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.900]   This happened to us when I had my EA
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.980]   try to get our daughter in
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.740]   for a last minute pediatrician appointment.
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.700]   And I was like, I feel so ridiculous
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.140]   calling the pediatrician's office
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.500]   or having someone else do it and being like,
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.380]   hey, could my boss's daughter get into the appointment?
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.340]   And I remember when I got to the pediatrician's office,
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.140]   I was talking with the person there and I was like,
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.940]   oh, is this, it was that awkward.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.140]   I was just curious.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.820]   And the response was like,
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.740]   no, we do this for the doctors all the time.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.500]   Like, they were like, this is normal.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.780]   Like, they were more, it was all in my head
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.060]   that it was not normal.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.500]   Now, I will say I've had friends
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.660]   who've pawned me off to their EAs to like schedule a dinner.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.740]   There is a feeling when that happens of like,
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.980]   well, I thought we were friends.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.820]   Now you want me to work with this other person.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.100]   Any thoughts around that whole kind of attitude
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.620]   and do you just have to get over it?
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.100]   - Some of it is just you have to get over it.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.740]   I was talking to somebody not too long ago
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.620]   where he's really struggling with this.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.620]   He's at a point in his life, he has kids,
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.300]   he has a meaningful amount of personal wealth.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.340]   He has a lot of responsibilities
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.260]   and he's totally underwater.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.820]   And I was talking to him, I said,
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.820]   you need somebody to help you manage your household,
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.500]   a head of household, like this is a role,
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.220]   people do this role.
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.620]   And he said, I can't because my mom would judge me.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.300]   Like my mom would not approve of that
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.460]   and it would be really difficult.
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.660]   And I don't know what you do in that situation.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.740]   It is something that will hold him back for quite some time,
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.380]   just not being able to get over that hurdle.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.100]   As soon as he does it, which he will do,
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.860]   it's inevitable because he is so underwater
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.820]   with all of his life responsibilities
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.980]   that there's no way he can manage this.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.060]   As soon as he does it,
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.620]   he's gonna wish that he did it five years earlier
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.420]   because it's gonna free up so much of his time.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.980]   This laundry list of things that he wants to get done
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.660]   that he doesn't have capacity to do
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.900]   will all of a sudden start getting done
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.580]   and he'll wonder why he waited so long.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.500]   I think the answer is probably therapy.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.980]   It's like how people get through that,
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.580]   but I don't see any other solution other than that.
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.900]   - Let's talk about a few other pain points.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.540]   One for me was, I didn't think I had enough
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.660]   for someone to do.
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.020]   And maybe this stems from,
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.180]   and we'll get to how you could actually execute this,
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.940]   hire an assistant, software, all these tools,
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.940]   but I had experimented with single task delegation
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.220]   where you hire a virtual assistant
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.220]   on the hourly or task basis.
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.420]   I had pretty poor experiences trying to do that
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.060]   because there's a certain relationship
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:32.900]   that needs to be built.
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.220]   I now understand that.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.700]   But early on, I was like, well, it's a lot of,
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.480]   I don't have enough to fill someone full-time,
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.940]   so do I need someone part-time?
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.980]   And it's so much work to ramp them up.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.100]   It just felt like too much.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.100]   And it felt like I didn't have enough work to justify it.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.160]   So I guess I have a bunch of questions.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.700]   One, how do you think about that?
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.820]   And I have some thoughts,
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.260]   but also the common thing I hear people say is,
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.700]   well, once you do this, it'll free you up
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.060]   to spend your time on things
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.780]   that can probably add a lot more value,
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.700]   especially when people think, oh, it's gonna be expensive.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.420]   It's, well, once you have this time,
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.380]   maybe you can create value elsewhere.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.940]   But that's so abstract.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.420]   So I guess let's break it down and say,
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.260]   how do you think about the fact
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.660]   that people don't think they have enough to do?
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.380]   And then separately, we can talk about
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.740]   how do you think about the value of what you could do,
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.700]   but it's very nebulous?
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.340]   - Yeah, so there's several different branches from that.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.980]   I think one is that you probably have more things to do
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.260]   than you realize.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.860]   I have a friend who very recently,
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.560]   finally went over the hurdle,
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.020]   got an EA, and immediately saw the value.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.260]   He's been fighting this for years.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.980]   He finally got one.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.560]   And within about two months, he had three.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.500]   His major hurdle was,
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.620]   I just don't feel like I have enough stuff for an EA to do.
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.580]   And then he got one, freed up a ton of his time,
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.600]   got two more within a couple months.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.860]   And so part of it is you have to just take the plunge
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.420]   and see if there is enough work for somebody to do.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.540]   Especially if you're in a meaningful leadership role,
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.360]   there's almost always more stuff to do.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.660]   I think what helps is if you work
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.900]   with typically would be an agency of some kind
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.500]   that is specialized in this,
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.420]   where the EAs are trained to be more proactive.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.260]   There's a few of them.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.860]   The one that we work with is Athena.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.900]   They have a training program to teach the EAs
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.160]   how to make you 10 times more productive.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.460]   That's their shtick.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.960]   And so they are trained to be proactive
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.740]   in finding ways to help you extend your leverage.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.380]   Whereas if you find one yourself,
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.140]   which is totally plausible and is probably less expensive,
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.460]   it's a lot more effort for you to have to learn
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.700]   how to interact with this person,
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.140]   how to train them onto your systems.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.340]   You have to teach them how to do things
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.020]   as opposed to the EA trying to pull
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.580]   and get more value from your time.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.820]   So I think that's one aspect is having the right pairing,
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.040]   depending on your level of experience.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.860]   If you're a highly experienced alligator,
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.220]   you can probably go with a less expensive option
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.100]   and you can do a lot of the training yourself.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.180]   Another branch of this, of the not having enough to do,
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:13.180]   is really try to lower the perceived risk
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.240]   of working with an EA.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.180]   I was talking to my brother about this very recently,
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.380]   where I said, he has a lot of things he needs to delegate.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.180]   And I said, you should just try hiring a person
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.180]   with this profile and just see how it goes.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.740]   And he's like, yeah, but it's gonna be X dollars per year,
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.460]   and then there's this, and then there's that.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.580]   Imagine, try to frame this as like a two-week experiment.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.580]   And how much is that gonna cost you?
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.900]   And if it doesn't work in two weeks,
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.620]   all you've lost is like $5,000.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.420]   Working backwards, do you think it's worth
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.340]   a $5,000 experiment to see if you can delegate
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.860]   all of these parts of your life
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.540]   that you don't really wanna do?
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.140]   The answer is, well, yeah, obviously, it's worth it.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.940]   But when you project out this,
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.420]   if you view it as a lifelong, fairly expensive commitment,
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.020]   the burden to get over that hump of,
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.140]   I should give this a shot, is just,
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.940]   it can be too high for some people.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.380]   So I think lowering that perceived risk threshold
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.500]   is another one.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.780]   - And that's something that I think happens to us
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.660]   as humans in a lot of ways.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.060]   I talk to people about, oh, I wanna quit my job.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.340]   And they're like, well, I'm gonna lose out
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.620]   on my $100,000 a year forever.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.020]   And it's like, no, you're gonna lose out
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.420]   on your $100,000 a year until you do something else
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.500]   to replace it.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.580]   So you could think of it as,
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.740]   if you think it'll take you three to six months,
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.180]   you're taking a 25 to $50,000 bet.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.540]   And what's possible, you know, and by the way, after tax,
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.380]   maybe it's half that if you live in California.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.980]   And so it just kind of changes that perspective.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.420]   So I think that's a really helpful perspective.
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.380]   And I've told a lot of people that now that I've done this,
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.900]   I've been like, look, commit to, I say three months.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.460]   I feel like two weeks might be short
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.820]   to really feel the value,
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.740]   though two weeks in, I felt the value.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.580]   But even at three months, it's a small,
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.620]   in my opinion, price to pay.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.380]   And when it comes to what's the upside,
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.820]   it's like, well, you can get a sense of that
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.060]   in those three months.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.940]   And then I'll just say to the previous thing
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.300]   you discussed about not having too much to do,
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.060]   my exercise I recommend people do is just for a week,
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.140]   just write down every task that you could delegate
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.980]   to someone who has built up enough context in your life.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.460]   And at the end of that week,
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.060]   you'll probably have a list that you're like,
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.020]   wow, maybe I do need to.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.140]   - For sure, yeah.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.780]   And it stacks up pretty quickly.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.260]   As you flex that muscle, this is, as I mentioned,
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.380]   the friend who avoided this for a long time
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.100]   and now has three EAs.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.020]   Once you flex that muscle and you learn
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.740]   what types of things can be delegated,
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.380]   then you start to see opportunities all around you.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.300]   It's something when you learn how to program
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.580]   for the first time, and then suddenly you discover
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.420]   all of these things that can be solved in software.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.900]   You realize that code can solve
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.900]   all kinds of automation problems.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.820]   So what are some examples?
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.620]   For software or a delegation?
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.900]   - A delegation.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.180]   - I'll describe it maybe in the more abstract sense,
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.300]   which is people often assume that much more context
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.380]   is necessary than is actually necessary
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.060]   in order to delegate something.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.740]   So a recent example that I had is,
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.940]   I have a CRM where I keep track of all of my friends
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.660]   and people that I want to stay in touch with.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.540]   And we had a situation where the locations
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.140]   that people were tagged in were getting
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.580]   a little bit too specific.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.620]   Like, do I really want it to say Los Gatos
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.500]   or do I want it to say Atherton or Bay Area?
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.980]   Because really, I don't need that level of specificity.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.540]   It makes it much harder to figure out where people are.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.660]   And so I just mentioned to my EA,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.620]   'cause I know that I can delegate this to them,
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.020]   where I said, "Anything that is not a major metro area,
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.220]   "find the nearest airport and assume
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.180]   "that that is the major metro area."
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.140]   'Cause that's probably where I'll be flying into.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.860]   And so they were able to handle that whole task.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.940]   And in the past, I probably would have said,
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.380]   "There's just too much context.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.220]   "They're in the Philippines.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.220]   "They don't know American geography.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.020]   "So I'm gonna have to go through all of these myself
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.140]   "and fix this."
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.220]   But if you come up with ways where you realize,
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.620]   "If I create these rules and these general heuristics,
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.420]   "you can delegate it a lot better."
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.100]   So once you learn what sorts of things
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.660]   don't require such specialized knowledge,
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.300]   and also when you lower that risk threshold
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.820]   of asking somebody to do something in parallel.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.420]   Another recent delegation that I did
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.140]   was I totally stole this idea from Wiz,
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.300]   one of our investors, where I thought it would be cool
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.460]   to make custom Magic the Gathering cards
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.020]   for everyone on our team.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.460]   And we have a company directory.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.580]   We have a Spotlight article,
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.380]   which has a bunch of background on them.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.140]   And so I spent maybe 15 minutes doing some demos
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.380]   where I said, "All right, here's what I want you to do.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.580]   "Go through each person in the company directory,
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.180]   "take their Spotlight article,
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.820]   "feed it into ChatGPT with a prompt like this
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.300]   "to get some sort of Magic the Gathering style,
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.580]   "like Ben is the marketing sorcerer,
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.500]   "and have some abilities and some cool stuff there.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.820]   "Feed his images into MidJourney,
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.780]   "generate a really cool-looking visual
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.660]   "using his actual face,
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.340]   "using that prompt that you just generated,
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.060]   "and then put that onto a Magic card
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.420]   "and then have that shipped."
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.820]   It took me 15 minutes to do that delegation,
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.740]   and it turned out super cool.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.380]   And I know enough about how to delegate that now,
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.260]   whereas five years ago,
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.500]   I probably would have said, "This is way too hard.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.460]   "There's so many intricacies
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.700]   "of what needs to be done here.
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.580]   "I wouldn't know how to use the proper language
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.100]   "to delegate that effectively."
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.980]   So it just takes a lot of practice,
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.980]   and you need to flex that muscle.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.380]   - So we're gonna come back to that language,
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.220]   but we have a veneer for both kind of work and personal,
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.700]   which I wanna get to that concept,
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.300]   but also hired through an agency.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.460]   We use an agency called Oceans.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.460]   Similarly, appreciate the training that I'm not doing,
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.020]   the managing I'm not doing, and that kind of stuff.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.460]   But we had started putting together a task list,
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.020]   because when you start working with someone,
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.500]   you need something for them to do.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.380]   And it was interesting because she's based in Sri Lanka,
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.740]   so her day started before we ever met.
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.500]   So she had about four hours of work before we ever met,
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.860]   and I was like, "Oh, I can't wait to give context on this."
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.820]   And so we put something in Notion
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.300]   that was just like,
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.580]   "We need to restain the wood in our backyard."
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.380]   And that was the prompt.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.220]   And I was like, "I can't wait
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.860]   "to give this person more context."
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.980]   And then we go to the first meeting,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.940]   and I was like, "Oh, they already found five people
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.620]   "in our general area, because they knew where we lived,
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.940]   "that can do patio staining, 'cause you can search that."
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.620]   And they had already emailed them and said,
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.020]   "Hey, what do we need to do to get a quote?"
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.460]   And I was like, "Oh, I didn't realize how easy this was
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.300]   "until I just wrote something.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.900]   "I totally agree that you think
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.660]   "you need more context than you need."
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.220]   I also wanna talk a little bit also
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.540]   about the language and all that,
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.460]   but let's talk briefly about finding this person.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.300]   So agencies are an option.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.380]   You mentioned the one you use, I mentioned the one I use.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.620]   We both seem to have great experiences there.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.860]   You can hire these people yourselves.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.620]   I agree, it usually comes at a lower cost,
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.540]   but the burden is more on you.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.780]   No matter where you go,
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.940]   I assume you have to do some vetting.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.500]   You've hired more EAs than I.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.260]   How do you think about that vetting,
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.260]   even though an agency might do some of it for you,
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.300]   you still wanna find someone that's a good fit for you.
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.180]   What have you learned in that process?
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.980]   - I would say we generally just set
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.500]   very high expectations for the agency.
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.100]   I think a lot of the agencies,
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.100]   I've worked with others in the past,
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.220]   they'll give you a slate of candidates.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.980]   I usually just tell them, "I'm not gonna do this.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.420]   "So you tell me which of these is the best
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.740]   "for what I wanna do, and if they don't work,
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.980]   "then I'm gonna fire them." (laughs)
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.900]   So I'm putting this on you.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.180]   This is not a me decision, this is a you decision.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.540]   When a friend of mine who was working at McKinsey
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.980]   for a partner, and he wrote up a whole slide deck,
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.380]   and the partner said, "All right, are you absolutely
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.380]   "confident that this is ready to ship?"
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.420]   He's like, "Well, let me double check."
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.380]   And he made some adjustments, he improved it.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.100]   He's like, "All right, are you now absolutely confident?"
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.980]   He's like, "I don't know, let me do a little bit more work."
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.620]   And he's like, "All right, are you absolutely confident
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.460]   "this is ready?"
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.460]   He's like, "Yes."
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.420]   And he didn't even look at it, he just shipped it.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.380]   And he's like, "Look, we hired you
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.420]   "because this is what you do."
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.300]   If you work with an agency that you trust,
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.500]   and you let them do the vetting,
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.100]   they're gonna know a lot more about the stuff than you will.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.300]   The worst case scenario is you just have to rematch
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.920]   if you work with an agency.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.800]   I would say, if you end up working with an individual,
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   the best way to do it is probably through real work tasks.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.220]   So coming up with a task of here,
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.100]   it's almost like a scavenger hunt.
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.300]   It's like, here are five tasks that I often do.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.980]   Here's a loom explaining what I need you to do,
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.100]   and then just do it.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.620]   And the times when I have had that done,
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.980]   it is remarkable how wrong some of them can be.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.700]   And you just know immediately.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.940]   I would say the most basic thing that you're looking for
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.220]   is ability to follow instructions.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.900]   It's like, what I want you to do is download this thing,
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.500]   look up these things, put it in this format,
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.020]   and then you just do none of those things.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.580]   And you just end up with something completely different.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.440]   It's like, okay, this is just not gonna work.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.780]   So at the most basic, ability to follow instructions,
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.940]   if you're assessing a candidate,
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.580]   would probably be the biggest one.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.940]   I think the second order to that
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.840]   would be their ability to be proactive
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.460]   in finding new things.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.860]   I would say, if they follow those instructions
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.100]   and they can come up with ways of saying,
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.760]   and I think it would actually be better
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.220]   if we also did these things,
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.420]   and maybe you hadn't thought of this as well,
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.780]   that's a really good sign,
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.340]   because it's lowering that burden that you have
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.080]   to think through the process.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.900]   Like, as recently as today, one of my EAs said,
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.860]   "Hey, I noticed I was doing this process for you,
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.980]   but it's not really getting a lot of engagement.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.540]   I think we can probably kill this
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.820]   and fold it into this other process."
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.300]   It's like, "Oh yeah, I totally forgot
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.420]   that we were doing that.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.660]   I'm on board."
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.680]   And so, that level of proactivity
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.700]   is a really important one as well.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.820]   I'm sure many other things,
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.100]   but those are probably the two biggest ones I'd look for.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.620]   - Those two were top of my list.
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.140]   And the third was just the ability
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.340]   to ask questions if uncertain.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.180]   And this, we'll get to kind of cultural challenges,
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.900]   but there are some people where you give a task
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.320]   and if they don't know how to do it,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.300]   the kind of default answer is, "Well, let's just do it."
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.300]   And then in some people's, the default answer is,
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.000]   "Well, let me ask a clarifying question."
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.840]   And I think for me, once we built up that expectation,
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.020]   it's like, I'm not always gonna be perfect.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.900]   I'm not always gonna give you the context.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.640]   But if you don't have it, just ask.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.980]   Like, it's okay.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.180]   It reminds me of, there are some cultures in Asia
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.260]   where you tell someone something and they'll just nod
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.300]   as if they understood, even if they didn't.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.300]   And it's like, that is not the best quality in an EA,
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.140]   at least for me.
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.660]   Maybe this varies person to person.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.020]   - Yeah, it's an interesting one
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.740]   'cause I definitely hear the clarifying question thing.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.660]   The nature of these clarifying questions,
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.220]   I've actually had to work with a few EAs
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.100]   who struggle with this,
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.860]   is try to make it so that your clarifying questions,
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.900]   I only have to answer yes or no to.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.840]   If your clarifying question puts more work onto me,
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.200]   it is a bad question.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.880]   So, I don't know if you've had this experience,
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.720]   but sometimes the clarifying question will be,
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.560]   you ask them for some basic task.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.520]   And like, "Well, what about this?
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.360]   What if this happens?
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.180]   What about this?
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.020]   What about that?"
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.420]   It's like, "Oh God, I've just spent 10 minutes
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.740]   clarifying this."
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.480]   Versus, "It's unclear to me what this would be.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.840]   How I interpret this is, it's probably this.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   Is this correct?"
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.680]   Yes.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.120]   "I assume that what you mean by this is this other thing.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.000]   Is that right?"
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:31.840]   Yes.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.520]   And so, always trying to get to a point
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.280]   where the resolution is just me saying yes or no,
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.680]   as opposed to putting the burden back onto me
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.920]   for the clarification,
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.280]   where I have to think through all the different implications
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.040]   of different tasks.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.520]   I have had that experience.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.520]   Totally understand.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.320]   I've had it as just a leader with employees as well.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.420]   It doesn't apply just to assistants.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.360]   This year, I'm trying to level up everything.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.120]   And that includes my fitness routine and clothing.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.480]   The routine does require a bit of willpower,
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.960]   but when it comes to the clothing,
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.360]   our sponsor today, Viori, is making that so easy.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.640]   Viori makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.360]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.600]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.320]   And it is so freaking comfortable.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.160]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.880]   I know because Amy and I are actually wearing Viori
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.940]   all the time.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.920]   I've long said the Sunday performance joggers
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.920]   were my favorite,
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.200]   but I wear my core shorts and strato tech tees
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.440]   almost as much.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.580]   But I really love that Viori keeps adding
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.680]   some amazing new collections of jackets,
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.240]   sweaters, and more.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.700]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.720]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.440]   but they're also great for lounging
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.000]   and running around town.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.880]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.320]   And for all the Hacks listeners,
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.960]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:12.240]   Most of you probably already know
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.360]   how much I love Notion, our sponsor today.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.800]   I use it every day for managing tasks,
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.360]   taking notes, writing docs,
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.520]   and even planning our family travel.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.180]   And now with AI built right inside of Notion
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.360]   that works across your entire workspace,
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.640]   it's even better.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.300]   In fact, I just used it yesterday
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.360]   to start auto-filling a table I was making
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.080]   for a new All The Hacks project,
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.040]   which saved me so much time.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.140]   I've also used it to look up travel details
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.360]   and find old notes.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.560]   And the reason all of this is possible
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.700]   is that Notion combines your notes, docs, and projects
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.120]   into one space that's simple and beautifully designed.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.280]   I love the features Notion keeps shipping,
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.600]   and it just reinforces our decision to use it
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.440]   as the central place we manage all of our life and work.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.600]   And the fully integrated Notion AI
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.880]   helps you work faster, write better, and think bigger,
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.000]   doing tasks that normally take you hours in just seconds.

[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.600]   - We both talked about two agencies
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.400]   that I know work with EAs overseas.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.960]   How have you thought about working with people
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.800]   in different time zones, different cultures,
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.760]   versus in-person, versus remote,
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.280]   as kind of a few criteria when hiring someone?
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.840]   - I think it totally depends on the tasks that you need.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.720]   So the earlier example I mentioned,
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.200]   my brother is looking for somebody to work with.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.400]   That would be in-person,
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.160]   because almost all of the things that he needs
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.840]   would need to be done by somebody who is in-person,
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.960]   near where he lives.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.680]   And so thinking about what it is that you need people to do,
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.240]   in my case, most of what I need,
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.040]   in fact, basically all of what I need,
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.320]   are background accountability-related tasks,
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.160]   just keeping the lights on, keeping the wheels turning,
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.120]   making sure that I have clear visibility and reporting
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.440]   on everything that's happening in the business.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.880]   And so that doesn't really need to be co-located.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.760]   It also really doesn't need to be in the same time zone.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.480]   I found that if you have no overlap on time zone,
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.200]   it can be pretty rough.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.880]   Levels is a remote-first company,
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.920]   but we still say the default time zone expectation
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.600]   is America's, which is basically California to Brazil.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.360]   If you live in the Philippines,
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.680]   if you live in India, wherever you live,
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.320]   you need to be available for at least that part of the day.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.360]   We don't have a lot of meetings,
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.880]   so it turns out not to be particularly onerous,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.760]   but if we're gonna schedule a meeting,
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.160]   the entire team is not gonna orient around,
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.240]   I guess we need to take this at two in the morning
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   to match the schedule of the person
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.000]   who's not in this time zone.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.400]   Otherwise, you end up running three different companies,
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.920]   and it's really, really tough.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.560]   There was a founder of a fairly large,
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.600]   fully remote company that I asked,
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.280]   "Do you have any regrets that,
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.960]   "things that you cannot undo at this point?"
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.680]   And his biggest regret was not setting
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.520]   time zone expectations.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.080]   He said, "We basically have three
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.640]   "fully independent companies,
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.200]   "and coordinating between them is a nightmare."
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.280]   He said, "If I could do it again,
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.160]   "I would just say, you can live wherever you want,
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.720]   "but America's is the time zone,
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.240]   "and you have to adapt to that."
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.160]   - I talked to a few companies when we hired REA.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.000]   We went with Oceans.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.080]   I didn't realize that some of the decisions they made
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.720]   were just by default making them
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.200]   because they knew they were better,
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.840]   and so I didn't know what I was missing
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.840]   had I gone somewhere else.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.440]   But for example, they asked me two or three intakes,
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.440]   and then said, "We think this person is the best for you."
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.640]   And I never even had to think about it,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.560]   which was wonderful. - That's awesome.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.280]   - I didn't realize what I could have had to do.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.920]   And then the other one was they said,
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.920]   "We think asynchronous and synchronous communication
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.200]   "can work together.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.320]   "So we are going to have your assistant work
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.160]   "from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Pacific
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.160]   "with three more hours asynchronous
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.680]   "while you're not working."
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.760]   And I was like, "That sounds good."
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.680]   I didn't realize the benefit at the beginning,
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.000]   but it is actually very helpful
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.440]   to have someone working when you're not working.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.160]   So you're signing off at the end of the day,
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.440]   and you can say, "Here's a few things
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.440]   "that need to get done,"
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.720]   and they're done when you wake up in the morning.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.560]   - Totally.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   - And I didn't realize the benefit of that.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.240]   - Yeah, I found it especially useful
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.480]   'cause I have almost exactly the same time zone overlap
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.040]   in terms of when we're live and when we're not.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.240]   And the advantage of rescheduling things in the morning
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.960]   or canceling meetings or anything that would need to happen
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.400]   that would impact my day
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.040]   that they can see before I'm even awake
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.920]   so that it's not a last minute scramble,
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.840]   it's already handled by the time I wake up,
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.880]   which is super handy for sure.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.320]   - One other thing you didn't mention
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.520]   that I thought was worth for some people hearing
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.440]   is if you choose to go the route
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.040]   of hiring this person yourself,
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.760]   you might save 50, 60%.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.280]   There are companies that will help you find that person,
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.440]   like a headhunter agency.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.880]   I think one of them is called Shepard,
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.960]   and they'll help you.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.240]   There is this weird emotional burden
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.840]   of you are now the employer of record.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.760]   And you mentioned rematching.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.520]   If something doesn't work out,
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.160]   just ask yourself the question
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.480]   of how good are you going to be at rematching
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.320]   knowing that you are going to result
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.840]   in someone losing their job?
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.000]   If you work with an agency and you rematch,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.720]   they'll find another person for that
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.800]   or another client for that EA.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.680]   So I think that's something that for me,
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.960]   it's not that I couldn't let someone go.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.440]   I've done that in the past and it's never fun,
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.240]   but I know that I'm paying a premium
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.040]   to have a lot of the overhead removed.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.960]   And I just think, especially for someone
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.880]   who's trying this out for the first time like I was,
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.440]   it has been the right decision for me.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.120]   And I'm someone who loves to save money.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:13.960]   - For sure.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.240]   The opportunity cost is real.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.400]   People often evaluate opportunity cost as $0,
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.760]   but it's not.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.120]   It's very much not $0.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.000]   - Yeah, the things that I have now been able to do,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.960]   both in terms of free time and just other work projects
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.000]   that have actually generated revenue is really incredible.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.600]   One of the reasons that's possible
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.240]   is that our EA works both on personal stuff,
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.960]   family stuff and work stuff.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.640]   Have you seen that to be successful?
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.320]   I know you've had multiple EAs and I asked myself,
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.120]   should I have done this separately and had two
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.800]   and split their work or had them be part-time?
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.840]   How do you think about that like house,
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.520]   personal version of an EA and work version?
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.680]   - So I haven't done much of the house stuff,
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.520]   but certainly the work and personal.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.840]   Part of it is for a lot of people like for me,
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.320]   there's no line between what is work and what is not work.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.800]   Like if I have a personal task
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.040]   that I'm going to do,
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.120]   it means I'm just going to be doing less work
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.320]   because otherwise I'm just gonna be working.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.200]   There's no line of, I only work X number of hours.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.600]   Any minute that I'm spending doing personal things
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.120]   is a minute that is detracting
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.640]   from work that I would be doing.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.760]   So that might change once we have kids, which is imminent,
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   but it will definitely change.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.200]   - Well, the kids will be a personal thing you're doing
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.120]   and you'll say, I want to spend time with my child
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.640]   and I'm not able to work for it,
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.120]   which will actually make the value of all of this
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:42.760]   just so much higher because inherently you will lose time.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.680]   And not only will you lose time
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.840]   'cause you might just not sleep a lot,
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.080]   there's a lot of reasons you might lose time,
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.760]   but you will want to do other things.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.600]   And the fact that we had two children
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.160]   and I want to spend time with them
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.760]   doesn't mean that there's less work,
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.320]   like nothing magically changes.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.680]   So you need to get better at this.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.760]   - We have some memos internally on how to think about this.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.840]   We encourage people on our team
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.360]   to hand off more of their personal lives
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.400]   or more of their personal tasks to their EAs,
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.160]   even though the EAs are paid for by work.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.600]   But it really depends a lot on what the task is
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.160]   and who the person is and what their intent is.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.760]   So a recent example,
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.280]   one of our executives was really underwater
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:30.640]   on selling a house, doing taxes,
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.080]   like keeping up with all of these things
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.240]   in their personal life.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.360]   That was just, it was really a lot
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.920]   in addition to all of their work responsibilities.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.920]   We made it super clear,
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.520]   you can absolutely use your EA to help you
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:47.680]   do those things and really lowered that cognitive load
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.320]   of managing those things.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.640]   But there is a line and it's fuzzy.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.360]   It's admittedly a fuzzy line.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.520]   A really obvious crossing that line
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.920]   is you use your work EA to run your side business
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.160]   to that is revenue generating
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.880]   or has some personal benefit
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.400]   that is unrelated to the business.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.320]   You can always rationalize these things of like,
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.680]   well, if I didn't have my EA doing it,
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.280]   then I would be working on that
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.440]   instead of doing level stuff.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.640]   But if you're making money on a product
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.880]   and you have costs of labor associated with that,
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.120]   levels should not be paying for it.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.480]   You should just have your own team doing that.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.520]   Everything in the middle is a little bit fuzzy
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.520]   and you just kind of have to use your judgment
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.040]   of is doing this thing,
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.120]   is this in the best interest of the company?
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.640]   Is it the case that you delegating
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.240]   this part of your personal life to an EA?
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.000]   Is that going to benefit the company?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.200]   Are we going to have better output from you because of that?
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.560]   And if the answer is yes, do it.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.000]   If not, don't do it.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.840]   If you ever have questions,
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.680]   you can always just ask somebody.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.400]   It's good to socialize these things.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.160]   Like if you think it's reasonable
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.480]   and you ask somebody and they recoil,
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.720]   it's probably a bad sign
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.120]   and you probably shouldn't do that.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.000]   But yeah, just asking around
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.320]   is usually a good way of getting feedback
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.120]   on whether it's appropriate or not.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.360]   - And if you're someone who's working on your own
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.520]   or just hiring an EA to help you,
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.360]   then it doesn't matter.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.560]   - It doesn't matter at all.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.280]   - I'm not actually sure how companies would feel
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.680]   that don't provide EAs to someone hiring their own EA
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.480]   to help scale them at work.
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.360]   I'm going to throw that into the ether
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.280]   unless you have opinions.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.840]   But on the personal side,
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.480]   I've talked to a lot of people about our experience,
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.200]   many of whom are a little bit later,
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.960]   have some kids, both adults working
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.720]   and the value of just having an EA
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.880]   for completely non-work stuff
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.200]   is enough to have someone full-time.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.680]   And for cost, for people who are just like,
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.040]   "Wait, wait, wait, how much is this?"
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.680]   I would say, I have not heard of anyone
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.640]   finding an EA directly on their own,
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.120]   fully loaded for less than $1,000 a month.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.760]   And maybe there's some edge cases.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.400]   I have not heard of anyone spending
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.080]   more than $4,000 or $5,000 a month for someone remote.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.760]   And then in person, you could spend $10,000, $15,000.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.400]   So just for people who have some rough sense of that,
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.920]   I would say for somewhere in the order of,
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.800]   let's call it $20,000 to $40,000 a year,
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.200]   you could probably find a very talented person
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.520]   somewhere outside of the United States
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.960]   to give you a lot of leverage.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.520]   And in our personal life,
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.280]   there are just so many examples of things
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.280]   that I think always sit on that kind of mental burden.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.560]   So it's like, "Oh, we're gonna go on a trip."
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.880]   As soon as you book a trip, there's like a checklist.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:35.720]   You'll learn this.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.160]   It's like, okay, well now we have to notify the dog walker
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.920]   that the dog needs to go somewhere.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.200]   Now we need to notify the school
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.280]   that a kid's not gonna be there.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.120]   And we need to notify the swimming class
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.160]   that that's not gonna happen.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.800]   And we need to make sure,
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.520]   just double check that our passports haven't expired
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.800]   or are going to expire within six months.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.640]   Because if anyone doesn't know,
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.480]   there are a lot of countries
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.840]   that even if your passport is valid,
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.640]   won't let you in unless it's six months out.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.360]   And so you could almost create this checklist
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.720]   of every time we book a trip.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.760]   And then be like, "Well, this is what we need to do."
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.240]   Or it seems like something crazy
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.120]   to have someone overseas do,
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.480]   but research five healthy meals
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.200]   and order the ingredients for them
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.280]   on Instacart or Amazon Fresh
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.280]   and put the recipes in an app
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.960]   so that we can see them as a meal plan and cook them.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.200]   Like that is a thing someone anywhere in the world can do.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.760]   And the worst case is you might get a meal
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.480]   that's not the exact thing you would have picked yourself,
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.600]   but you spent no time planning it.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.040]   That was one where we started doing it.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.840]   And then we experimented with a meal kit company
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.680]   called Green Chef.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.800]   And it's just been like, "Oh, this is great."
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.680]   Sometimes we forget to pick the meals and we're like,
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.760]   "Oh, we didn't pick it,
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.200]   but we didn't have to think about it."
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.040]   And so in our personal lives,
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.960]   there've just been like these countless research this,
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.200]   help figure this out, help plan this,
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.520]   find someone to stain the patio furniture,
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.600]   call Delta because our flight was five hours late.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.760]   And I know that we need to get some compensation for this
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.040]   or we need to change this thing.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.640]   All of those have made it tremendously valuable.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.720]   I did an episode with Dan Martell
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.720]   who wrote this book called "Buy Back Your Time."
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.760]   And he has a house manager,
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.560]   much like your friend would need.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.400]   - I don't know that book.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.240]   I'm gonna write it down.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.320]   - It's focused a little bit more on business than personal,
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.320]   but he is a expert delegator,
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.560]   which I have a couple of questions about things he does
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.040]   if your experience there matches.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.040]   But he has someone doing all these things.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.400]   He wants someone to go pick up dry cleaning.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.200]   Obviously that's something you'd need someone local,
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.080]   but it just opened my mind to the fact that
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.440]   even if you don't have enough work or side hustle projects,
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.600]   you might have enough personal projects.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.400]   And the freeing up of your personal time
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.960]   might unlock you to start that side hustle project,
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.120]   to start that business,
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.480]   to just spend more time with your kids.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.660]   Like there are things that might be not revenue generating,
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.520]   but life fulfilling that all could make this super valuable,
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.600]   even if it has nothing to do with work.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.580]   And so in our case, it spreads the line of both,
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.840]   but almost has shown so productive.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.440]   Like maybe we need to, maybe we want to,
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.960]   and then how would we split them and how we do that?
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.800]   That's a whole another topic, but I don't know.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.560]   It's seeing what it could unlock
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.480]   for someone outside of work is powerful.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.120]   - And it's funny, the idea of say,
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.200]   getting an EA to help you with work stuff,
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.920]   even if your work isn't paying for it.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.600]   If it's $20,000 a year
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.160]   and you have a really meaningful salary,
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.280]   it could accelerate you quite a lot
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.600]   in terms of your productivity.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.760]   And you'd really stand out in terms of where your peers are
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.520]   'cause you get so much more done.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.520]   But it does remind me of something from The Onion
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.920]   several years ago where there's a guy
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.920]   who had basically done exactly this
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.160]   and he outsourced his job to somebody in like Minnesota.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.240]   Then they interviewed that person
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.440]   and he had outsourced it to somebody in the Philippines
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.800]   and that person had outsourced for somebody in Pakistan.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.360]   The conclusion was 60% of the world's tasks
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.040]   are delegated to one guy in Pakistan.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.720]   (both laughing)
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.920]   You can definitely get a lot of leverage out of it for sure.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.440]   - Yeah, I would say, depending on the type of tasks,
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.760]   I would highly encourage someone
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.640]   to vet this with their employer
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.440]   before handing over their company's credentials
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.280]   or anything like that.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.600]   - Most companies would not be cool with that.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:10.160]   - Yes, but I could see a world where if you were in sales,
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.280]   which as you mentioned earlier, you wouldn't be,
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.520]   it could be a place where you could say,
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.000]   hey, could I hire someone on my own dime
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.520]   to help me source leads, to help me cold call,
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.360]   that kind of stuff.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.520]   Maybe you get the company to do it, but if not,
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.880]   I could see, especially for people on commission,
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.520]   with the approval of their employer,
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:29.080]   it could very seriously pay for itself quickly.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.400]   But we just talked about credentials.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.880]   You talked about an EA helping with taxes.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.680]   One of the things that I think a lot of people are hesitant
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.760]   with hiring someone they don't know overseas
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.400]   is like, how much do you give access to?
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.240]   Like, you're giving access to your email
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.480]   or your logins or your bank account
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.400]   or in the case of my friend Dan,
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.200]   he actually has his EA on his iMessage.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.480]   So all of his text messages, like everything.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.160]   How do you think about that kind of access,
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.960]   control and trust?
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.640]   - You wanna have as few people with access
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.680]   as is necessary to do whatever tasks
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.920]   you wanna do effectively.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.680]   It is a security vulnerability.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.600]   Any person who has access to it is a security risk.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.960]   And so you have to be very mindful of that.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.240]   You want it to be as few people as humanly possible.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.960]   What you give them access to,
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.640]   it's really gonna be a matter of your own personal risk.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.800]   And some of this also comes down to,
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:28.000]   there's a lot more recourse when you have, say, an agency,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.280]   they vet people.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.760]   Somebody from one of the agencies we've talked about,
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.200]   it's unlikely that that person is going to copy
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.520]   all of your information and dox you.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.000]   But if it's just some random internet troll
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.040]   that you don't realize that you've hired,
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.640]   you're not gonna be able to find this person.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.640]   You have no recourse if they do something
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.000]   that's inappropriate.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.840]   So that's one of the other risks you have to manage.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.160]   I don't have a car.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.440]   I generally just take Uber.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.400]   I think people often underappreciate
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.160]   how much liability you take on just from driving.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.320]   It's a very real thing.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.200]   And you don't have that liability when you're in an Uber.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.600]   And so pricing in, liability risk, insurance risks,
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.760]   the cost of the car, depreciation, gasoline,
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.920]   Uber is not as expensive as people think it is.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.920]   Because when you calculate all these different forms
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.840]   of exposure that you have, it's very real.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.400]   So personally, I do give access to a lot of these things,
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.680]   and I give it to as few people as necessary
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   to be able to get a task done effectively.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.320]   And I know people who are loathe to give access
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.920]   to basically anything for exactly the same reason.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.920]   It's just, it's too risky.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.400]   - I will say a few things I've picked up in giving access.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.800]   So I think most people listening
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.240]   will have a password manager.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.080]   And so, you know, that's one way to share access to things.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.800]   You could potentially give someone access to an account,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.640]   but not give them access to the two-factor code
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.440]   so you know when they're logging in.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.680]   That's something.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.600]   I separate email addresses for banking
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.920]   and things where someone could spend money
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.560]   or in my case, points.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.200]   Like, let's leave that separate.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.440]   And so that's one way that I've said,
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.840]   okay, you can have access to my email,
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.040]   but if you needed to, I don't know, send a wire transfer,
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.280]   the confirmation is not gonna come through there.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.120]   I know plenty of people that I've talked to
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.200]   separate their phones.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.360]   So they have two factors coming into one number
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.960]   and they have regular things coming to another.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.800]   So you could potentially give someone access
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.600]   to your text messages without giving them access
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.360]   to some of the controls they would need.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.200]   Also, there are a lot of financial institutions
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.360]   that actually have access controls.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.880]   So like, I think in Chase,
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.120]   there are probably plenty of people
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:32.960]   who have bad experience with Chase.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.040]   You could actually say like, oh, can I add a person?
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.200]   Can I delegate information and give them only these rules?
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.360]   Most business accounts already have this built in,
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.160]   but a lot of personal accounts don't.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.880]   But when you can find one that does, that can be helpful.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.160]   And a lot of times you can ask.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.560]   I remember someone I know just asked
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.960]   if they could have a Wells Fargo business account,
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.360]   but for themselves,
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.240]   because it had all these rules and these tools,
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.800]   but it was like a much worse login, terrible app,
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.760]   but they could set up these kind of procedures.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.720]   So that's some of the things I've thought about.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.800]   With credit cards, I hear someone,
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.760]   oh, they could spend all my money.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.560]   It's like, well, you also have liability
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.680]   and fraud protection.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.280]   You can add an authorized user and set a credit limit.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.200]   So I think there are ways to mitigate some of these things,
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.560]   but also every time you get on the highway,
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.520]   there is some risk that something like,
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.840]   I also have to weigh the risks of being able to have a life
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.720]   where I'm spending time doing what I want.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.680]   And sometimes that risk is just worth it.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.040]   - It's a risk calculation.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.560]   People in general have a very hard time assessing risk
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.200]   because status quo bias is so strong.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.840]   Whatever you're used to doing,
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.840]   and you've never experienced some catastrophically bad
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.760]   outcome from normal date,
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.800]   people really underestimate how dangerous driving is.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.600]   It's super dangerous, but we do it all the time.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.480]   And when you think about it in the abstract sense of like,
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.160]   yeah, we're just going to be whizzing by
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.360]   these multi-ton vehicles going at 70 miles an hour
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.480]   past each other with like people
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.280]   with very little experience driving while texting.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.600]   You would say that should be illegal.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.440]   There's no way that that is allowed.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.000]   And that's what we do all the time.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.520]   It's remarkable that it is as safe as it is.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:09.720]   And so every day you're making risk calculations.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.520]   You probably didn't check this morning
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.360]   whether somebody cut your brakes.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.600]   If that did, that would probably be really bad,
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.120]   but you probably didn't check that.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.120]   But if you did, it would decrease your risk
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.680]   that your brakes don't work.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.240]   Did you check that all of these other aspects of your car
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.000]   are functioning normally every day?
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.200]   Probably not.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.040]   And that's okay.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.120]   That's a risk that you take,
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.800]   and it's probably a reasonable one.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.280]   And so whatever that threshold is going to be for you,
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.120]   you just have to figure out what you're comfortable with
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.720]   and go with that.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.080]   - But I will say, even if you don't give up
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.760]   managing your finances to an assistant,
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.920]   there are still a lot of things
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.720]   that you could do to unlock stuff.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.680]   And for some inspiration, I actually,
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.600]   Athena has these playbooks
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.440]   that I thought are really interesting on their website.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.480]   I'll link to them in the show notes
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.280]   where it's just like ideas of things an EA could do.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.200]   On the personal side, I have a friend who, you know,
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.240]   uses it to be a better gift giver.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:01.160]   He's like, I want to track people's birthdays
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.520]   and I want to give better gifts.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.320]   And I want to make sure I'm more thoughtful,
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.800]   sporadically and spontaneously.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:09.680]   It's like, it unlocks not just things that they are doing
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.560]   that they don't want to do,
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.360]   but it unlocks things that they wish they could do
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.200]   and can't do now.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.440]   I don't know if there's things in your life
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:16.400]   where you've been able to do more
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.560]   that you never were doing before because of it.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.480]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:23.000]   It's less that they are things that I can't do myself.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.040]   It's more, I would not have been able to prioritize it
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.360]   because I would not have had capacity.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.000]   Like the magic card example that I gave,
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.360]   there was no universe where I could justify
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:35.520]   spending three days of dedicated time
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.720]   to making custom magic cards for everyone on the team.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.120]   It just makes no sense.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:44.400]   But I could justify 15 minutes on the instructions for it.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.360]   And the team really liked them.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.200]   And so there's a lot of those sorts of things
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.680]   where I can't justify doing these things consistently.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:55.000]   Like another one, oftentimes when a friend has a baby,
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   I'll send them flowers, which is like a nice gesture.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.680]   And can I justify myself or all of my friends
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.840]   figuring out what their address is,
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.840]   what the local florist is,
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.080]   what kind of flowers we should get?
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:12.120]   I would probably have to spend 100 hours a year
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   on this task.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.760]   And it's just, I can't justify that.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:20.680]   But if I can lower that threshold to 30 minutes a year,
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.440]   yeah, totally worth doing.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.520]   So that's what I mean when I talk about getting leverage
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.320]   is that you're able to get leverage
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.800]   and you're able to do a lot more of the kinds of things
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.240]   that you really like to do,
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.320]   but it's just hard to justify relative to other priorities.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.040]   - Let's go a little deeper on how you onboard people
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:37.880]   to these things.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:39.200]   So you say 30 minutes, 15 minutes here,
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.040]   you gave the example earlier in how you could spend time
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.240]   delegating the magic, the gathering task.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.960]   What things do you do, tools do you use
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.600]   to make onboarding an EA or anyone that's helping you
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:54.600]   on your team for that matter, more effective at doing them?
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.960]   - So the biggest tool is Loom,
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:59.520]   which is a screen recording tool.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:03.160]   And it allows you to capture what it is
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.160]   that is on your screen.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.120]   It allows you to capture it on content as well.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:11.600]   This is one of the struggles of where people delegate
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:12.680]   in a more traditional sense,
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.160]   which is you have a phone call or you do it on a Zoom call.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.560]   And then they're taking notes furiously
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.800]   while you're explaining the tasks to them.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.880]   And as soon as you end the call,
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.440]   they have forgotten what it is that you told them.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.760]   The nice thing about Loom is you can record it async
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.120]   on your own time, you can send it to them,
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:33.280]   they can watch it at 2X, they can watch it again,
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.960]   they can pause it, they can take notes,
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.920]   they can come back to it a week later,
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.960]   and they can refresh on what the task was.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.320]   So solving this in content is really the best way
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.400]   to go about it.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.360]   Other tools, I would say Voice Notes is a really good tool.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.280]   I often use Signal, they have a good Voice Note tool.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.080]   The Athena app actually is pretty good.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.480]   Have you seen that one at all?
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.640]   - I have not.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.680]   - It's pretty cool.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.720]   You don't even need to use Athena for it.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.400]   My brother actually uses it for an unrelated use case,
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.240]   but it's a cool thing where you open it up
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:07.400]   and then it immediately starts recording a Voice Note.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.200]   And you set it up where once you finish recording
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.080]   the Voice Note, it emails it to whoever you specify.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:17.240]   And so if you have an EA, if it's people that you know,
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.200]   however you want to delegate these things,
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.480]   you just record a Voice Note and then you press Done
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.320]   and then it just sends it to that email address.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.920]   It's a very, very simple tool.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.720]   - I've heard Whisper Notes or Whisper Memos
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:31.400]   is another very good tool for that same use case,
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.600]   but layering in transcription and a little bit of AI.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.920]   I haven't used it, but I know a few people
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.200]   that swear by it as the tool for that purpose.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.040]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.080]   There's a few similar tools like that.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.840]   Voice Notes are really helpful
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:48.840]   because the friction of pulling out your phone,
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.000]   writing it out with your thumbs,
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.720]   I have just found is usually too high
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.680]   to get the task out of my head.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.160]   And by the time I've opened my phone,
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.600]   I've opened up my email and I've started typing
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.400]   and I've already forgotten what it is I wanted to delegate.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.880]   If I can just open up my phone and say,
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:10.680]   "Hey, remember to send that thing to that person."
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:13.600]   Or, "Hey, I just had a meeting with this person.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.720]   "Please make sure to follow up with these three people
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.480]   "so that they know that that meeting happened
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.960]   "and this was the outcome."
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:20.800]   And then I'm done.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.880]   I'm convinced that the thoughts that we have are ephemeral.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.600]   When you write out your ideas,
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.760]   that is the externalization of those thoughts.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.680]   And those thoughts have now left your brain.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.840]   They're now in this artifact.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.040]   And so the sooner you can get
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.600]   in these fleeting moments of inspiration,
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.240]   the faster you can get them out of your head
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.200]   and into some artifact that can be action, the better.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.840]   - One other tool that has been really interesting
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.200]   to play with.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:51.240]   I don't know if you've used the ChatGPT app with voice.
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:52.080]   - No, I haven't.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.000]   - So you can open up the ChatGPT app now
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:54.840]   and you can say,
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.240]   "Hey, I'm trying to prep an interview guide
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.960]   "about delegation."
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:03.160]   And it feels like a conversation where the other person
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.880]   is like lagging behind you three seconds
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.120]   'cause it has to think.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.320]   But I experimented with actually prepping an interview
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.840]   in a voice conversation.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.560]   And my only criticism is that you have to instruct it
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:19.360]   not to give you too much feedback until the end maybe,
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.640]   because they might say, "Oh, here's the guide again."
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.640]   And read through it all and then read through it all.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:27.320]   But it synchronizes everything with the GPT website and app.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.360]   So you go get the text of it later,
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.120]   but you can actually have a conversation.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.840]   And I wish I knew the name for whatever phenomenon,
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.920]   psychological principle, something is,
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:40.160]   but it is sometimes much easier for many people
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.400]   to get something out in a conversation than writing.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.160]   Not just the friction and the time,
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.920]   but you actually sometimes get a higher quality product.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.480]   And so I find that when I'm trying to struggle
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.640]   to think about things,
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.600]   my wife and I all brainstorm an idea together.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:55.200]   And I'm like, "Wow, I got a lot more out of that."
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.680]   And sometimes she's like, "I didn't even say anything.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.000]   "I just sat here and you talking to me."
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.440]   Similar to kind of rubber duck debugging.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.240]   It's like just having a person to talk to
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.440]   and audibly bring it out loud can generate something.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.800]   And so yes, you can record yourself,
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.600]   but I encourage people to check out GPT Voice
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.640]   'cause you can have that conversation and get feedback.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.600]   You can do it in your AirPods.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.200]   It's almost like a little AI assistant
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.600]   that you have to trigger with the app.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.440]   - Cool, yeah.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.280]   I have it on my phone.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.120]   I just haven't used that.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   I'll check that out.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.520]   - You definitely said Loom was important,
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.560]   but I wanna make sure we give it a little bit more emphasis
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.240]   'cause I've started using it for almost everything.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.680]   And it basically, anytime I'm doing a task,
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.760]   I just record it, at least the first time.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.640]   And so even if I'm not sure I wanna delegate it,
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.560]   I'll be like, "Oh, I'm gonna go set up a new invoice.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.640]   "Let me just record it.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.240]   "And I'll go put it in a repository
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.640]   "of all the things I do.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.720]   "Oh, I'm gonna book a flight.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.840]   "Let's record how I search for flights."
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.080]   I don't like to delegate my travel.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.600]   I think you don't either, but at least there is a video.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.520]   If I ever wanted to tell someone how I book a flight,
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.240]   I can walk them through the process of how I think about it.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.200]   There's no cost.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.800]   As a early Loom user, I assumed every video
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.800]   had to have me talking with the video and the audio.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.840]   You can just make a video of you just working.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.640]   A part of me is like, "Should I just record my whole day
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.480]   "so that I can..."
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.960]   There's an app called Rewind
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.120]   that records your screen all day,
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.560]   records your audio all day,
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.600]   and you can actually go back and search through it.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.040]   And it's super interesting for cases of like,
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.240]   "Oh, I was doing this thing.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.080]   "What was it?"
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.480]   And it OCRs everything so you can go search.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.080]   Not the same use case.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.280]   And I don't think it's as easy to go back and clip a thing,
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.640]   but it's kind of this idea of always on.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.800]   So I would just encourage everyone,
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.080]   if you haven't used Loom
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.600]   and you have any tasks you wanna share, to use it.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:37.600]   But also, I use it to push back on synchronous meetings.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.040]   And I wanna take a little tangent here
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.440]   'cause you've thought about this deeply.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.920]   I don't think, and I know you don't either,
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.320]   that having a synchronous meeting,
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.200]   and for anyone who's not familiar,
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.440]   just like both people are in the meeting at the same time,
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.040]   whether it's a phone call or a video,
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.880]   is really necessary all the time.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.880]   - I think it's unnecessary most of the time, yeah.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.360]   There are definitely use cases where it's really valuable
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.200]   and it is the best.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.520]   Like, we can't do this podcast asynchronously.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.040]   It wouldn't make any sense.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.640]   But some of the things that I found that are really useful
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.600]   is when somebody sends a meeting request,
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.920]   I will often send them a Loom in response and say,
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.080]   "Yeah, here's the answers to your questions."
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.080]   And it might take four minutes.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.880]   And they say, "Oh, okay, great, thank you."
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.080]   It took me four minutes.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.880]   They probably watched it at 2X.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.640]   That whole cycle took six minutes,
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.560]   as opposed to some scheduled time in the future,
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.840]   30 minutes of each of our time,
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.600]   where we may not have even delivered
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.120]   on what we wanted to anyway.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.640]   So you can skip all the small talk of the conversation
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.200]   and you can just get straight to the point.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.400]   So proactively sending Looms, I have found,
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.640]   has reduced the number of meetings that I need to take
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.040]   by, I don't know, 80%, just 'cause a lot of times,
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.680]   you just don't need to have a call
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.320]   to get basic information that people are asking for.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.920]   - And the precursor to that sometimes for me
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.240]   is clarifying that there's actually a purpose.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.280]   I get a message from someone that's like,
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.040]   "Oh, we're in this WhatsApp group together,
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.720]   would love to connect."
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.640]   And I might write back and say,
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.480]   "Hey, the next two months are crazy."
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.440]   Like right now, I'm on a mission to get 12 episodes ahead,
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.920]   just so that it feels like there could be a break.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.600]   So the next two months are crazy.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.840]   If there's something you actually want to discuss,
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840]   feel free to send it over.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.520]   I'm happy to record a response,
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.080]   or feel free to use Loom and make a Loom
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.800]   and we can have a conversation, especially with kids.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.760]   There's a lot of times where they're asleep,
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.880]   I'm trying to be quiet.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.080]   It's midnight, but I could be responsive.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.640]   And I find that does two things,
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.480]   two things positive and one thing negative.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.480]   Sometimes there are interesting conversations
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.760]   that probably wouldn't happen
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.800]   because the other person didn't really have an agenda,
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.440]   but wanted to just connect.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.120]   Many times that would have been a waste of time.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.720]   Sometimes it's not, and we should talk about that.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.720]   But I do think that oftentimes it reduces meetings
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.000]   that are not necessary.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.120]   Like someone, we just didn't need to meet.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.320]   It raises the burden for someone
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.520]   to actually have a conversation,
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.880]   but not in a way that says no.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.480]   So if I get an email, it's like, I'm too busy to meet.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.880]   It's like, oh, that kind of feels bad.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.280]   But it's like, I'm too busy to meet synchronously.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.760]   But if you want to record a video, I will get back to you.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.360]   So it just kind of makes the whole process easier,
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.200]   I don't know, for me.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.360]   But I do hate that sometimes I'm missing out.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.200]   - What I have found is that connecting on Zoom
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.960]   is soul crushing.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.640]   And so I don't do it, generally speaking.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.880]   If somebody says like,
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.140]   hey, do you want to jump on a 30 minute call?
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:31.680]   The answer is almost always going to be no,
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.920]   unless there's a specific agenda of what we will discuss.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.320]   I have a much lower bar
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.080]   for meeting somebody for coffee in person.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:43.400]   Because even if there isn't a clear agenda,
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.160]   it's much more energizing to just be in person
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.920]   and talking to people.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.200]   Part of this is also I utterly lack discipline
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.640]   and the ability to wake up at a reasonable hour.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:59.120]   And so I often will schedule 8 a.m. coffees
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.200]   just to force myself to wake up at 7.30.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.760]   Because otherwise I'll wake up at 10 or 11.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.920]   And so that's a really helpful strategy
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.720]   to just get me out of bed in the morning.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.920]   - Having children will also help with this.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.360]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.440]   Yeah, my friends who have kids,
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.720]   they seem to wake up at four or five in the morning now.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.960]   One interesting thing is that
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.280]   I now delegate a lot more of my travel than I did before.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.520]   It used to be the case that there was too much nuance
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.760]   in my travel schedule that I've tried delegating
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.500]   and I didn't have much luck.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.880]   But now that none of the airlines
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.240]   have cancellation and change fees,
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.320]   it is a much lower burden
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.280]   to effectively semi-automate the process.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.760]   My entire travel schedule
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.880]   is fixed three months in advance, generally speaking.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.400]   And so my EAs will see my travel schedule
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.200]   and they will proactively book flights,
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.400]   but they don't necessarily need to be the flights
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.440]   that I will take.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:59.120]   So I can see three months out or two months out,
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.740]   oh, they booked the wrong flight,
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:01.920]   and then I could just change it.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.000]   It's not a big deal.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.440]   But at this point, 80% of the time,
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.600]   it's the correct flight
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.040]   and it's not a huge burden to change it.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:13.000]   So I would say that I have semi-automated my travel
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.840]   because they can see my schedule,
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.520]   they can book the flights proactively,
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.360]   and then I can just change it as necessary.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.120]   So I found that to be very helpful.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.480]   - I know Sam and I have covered so much
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.760]   on the topic of assistance,
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.920]   but I've gotten so much value in my work
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.180]   and even my life from just having an amazing EA.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.080]   Thank you, Pasini, if you're listening, you are awesome.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.760]   And I really hope that any of you
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.400]   who end up hiring one yourself
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.720]   have an amazing experience too.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.600]   As I mentioned, I found my EA
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.120]   through a company called Oceans,
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.480]   and not only have they been awesome to work with
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.600]   on that front,
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.120]   they also spent a bunch of time with me the last few weeks
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.240]   to help me put together a very comprehensive 13-page guide
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.360]   that lays out 10 tactical steps you need to take
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.480]   before, during, and after hiring your assistant
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.360]   to really create a paradigm shift in the way you work.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.120]   It includes so much of what I've learned this year,
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.840]   some anecdotes and some tips,
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.520]   as well as everything they've learned
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.920]   running a business in the space for the past few years too.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.640]   It's totally free, so if you wanna give it a read,

[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.360]   And big thank you to Ian, their CEO,
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.240]   for offering anyone who signs up
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.800]   and mentions All The Hacks $1,000 off their first month.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.560]   Definitely check both of those out.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.820]   It seems like with every business,
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:43.160]   you get to a certain size and the cracks start to emerge.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.040]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.360]   and you have too many manual processes
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.560]   and there's no one source of truth.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.560]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers,
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.880]   37,000, 25, one.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.160]   37,000, that's the number of businesses
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.440]   which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle,
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.040]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.640]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.760]   streamlining accounting, financial management,
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.040]   inventory, HR, and more.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.960]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.800]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less,
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.900]   close their books in days, not weeks, and drive down costs.

[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.760]   which I can tell you from all the companies I've run,
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.960]   makes everything so much better.

[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.920]   - I think if you apply the Pareto principle,
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.360]   like the 80/20 to a lot of things,
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:12.440]   especially in the world of optimization,
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.480]   I've found that you get to separate the decision
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:18.560]   from the optimal outcome and unopt outcome.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.680]   So it's like, well, the example I've used a lot is,
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.680]   I had an insurance policy for our home,
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.480]   and then we realized the home had appreciated it.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:28.080]   It was like, we need more coverage.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.400]   I also would like to have the cheapest policy.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.920]   And so I mixed those two things together and said,
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.760]   well, let's go find the best policy.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.000]   Now, this happened again later in life,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.440]   and it was like, let's get a policy
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.760]   that covers the house at the right amount.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.440]   And then I can decide whether I want to go
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.800]   through the process of optimizing
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.000]   to save a little bit more.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.240]   So in your case, it's like, let's book a flight.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.520]   And then I can decide if it's worth trying to drill in
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.240]   and find the best thing or just take the one that's booked.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.360]   And so I've tried to get a lot better at,
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.160]   let's just do the easy 80% of the thing I want,
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.400]   and then separate the decision to optimize
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.600]   from the decision to do the first part.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.680]   Oftentimes, you can delegate that,
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.920]   like the hard part that you maybe feel
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.800]   uncomfortable delegating is that last 20%.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.800]   - Yeah, and the reason why I wasn't able
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.080]   to delegate travel as effectively before
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.640]   is that it used to be the case
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.840]   that in every airline except Southwest,
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.200]   if you book a flight, you're like signing a suicide pact.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.680]   You cannot cancel this flight,
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.360]   or they will charge you $150 plus a bunch of other fees.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.000]   Now there's no change fees, no cancellation fees,
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.840]   no anything.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.360]   So the risk of booking a wrong flight is much lower.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.840]   - Yeah, it's like you might get some credit.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.720]   - Yeah, which I'm gonna use anyway.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.720]   - Unless you're booking something obscurely international,
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.880]   where you probably wanna get it right
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.160]   because a Kenya Airways credit
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.800]   might not be that useful to you in the future.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.920]   Okay, so when it comes to meetings,
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.920]   you've talked about using looms
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.560]   as a way to reduce the meetings you have.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.800]   But I also know that having more relationships,
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.960]   meeting more people is something you're interested in.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.240]   Yes, you can meet them in person,
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.680]   but how do you think about that entire project
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.800]   of building relationships, networking?
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.280]   I know you've said you kind of default
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.480]   to more of an introverted person.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.480]   You say you don't wanna be in sales,
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.760]   you'd rather be an engineer.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.760]   How do you think about building your network
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.320]   and taking meetings that might be a waste of time,
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.120]   but could turn into really powerful connections?
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.680]   - It's something that really came from the recognition
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.120]   that so many of the good things in my life
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.440]   have just come from people that are around me.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.080]   And very rarely is it actually something that I did.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.040]   I put more emphasis on being around people
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.120]   than I care about.
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.800]   There's a lot of spontaneity in these meetings.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.640]   There are often people that I don't know very much about,
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.920]   and I meet with them.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.720]   They're usually friends of friends.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.280]   There's a, I forget who has this quote,
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.880]   but I think it's a really,
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:56.080]   it's a useful mindset to come into every conversation,
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.000]   including every conversation with your Uber driver,
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.680]   which is, "Every man is my superior in some way."
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.560]   It's some variant of that quote.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:09.000]   It has always surprised me how there were life experiences
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.080]   from people, there are ideas that people have
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:16.640]   that are really fascinating and often different
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.280]   than your own worldview.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.040]   And so figuring out how to learn from other people
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.320]   in any context, I think it's just, it's a skill to develop.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.560]   And once you get good at it and you really are excited
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.000]   to talk to people and learn from them,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.560]   it's really energizing.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.720]   So I appreciate that aspect of meeting new people.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.920]   I would say I rarely come in with a specific agenda.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.440]   It's like something that I want out of a person,
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.880]   but it is surprising how often unexpected value
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.360]   comes from these things.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.400]   I would say that I'm convinced
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.960]   that the universe is conspiring in my favor.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.080]   It's just, these things happen in a way
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:57.400]   that it just seems much too improbable to be random.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.600]   - And you said, once you get good at it,
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:00.520]   what does that look like?
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.440]   You're meeting with a random person you don't know,
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.560]   what do you do now differently
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.280]   than you would have done before?
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.920]   - So I think some of it is you,
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.800]   who was it that I was talking to?
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.960]   He had a good way of describing it.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.760]   He says he really doesn't like beige conversations,
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.160]   which is just like, yeah, weather is good, food.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.240]   I eat food too, food and weather.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.400]   And you just kinda, you spend 10 minutes
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:25.320]   just sort of talking about beige things.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.680]   And the sooner you can get to a point
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.520]   of asking a more interesting question,
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.360]   the biggest thing is, I think this was in
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.320]   How to Win Friends and Influence People,
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.080]   where he says it's really important
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.440]   to remember people's names.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.920]   The most important trick to doing that,
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.080]   to remembering people's names,
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.400]   is first you have to want to remember their names.
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:48.200]   That's the secret, is you actually have to want to do it.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.480]   If you don't want to do it, you're not gonna do it.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.200]   And so I think that's a big part of it,
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.600]   is you have to want to find something interesting
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.640]   in these other people.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.920]   If you're just going through the motions,
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.280]   it's not gonna be fun.
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.360]   And so if you learn about somebody's background,
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.160]   where they're from, what they're struggling with,
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.360]   if they have any regrets in their life,
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.280]   what they're excited about,
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:13.520]   and just the sooner you can get past that initial point
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.920]   of just sort of a conversation that you could place in
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.680]   with any random person in the world,
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.520]   then it would be exactly the same.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.000]   The sooner you can really start to get value from those
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.360]   and find them a lot more energizing.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.960]   - I mean, I guess maybe one of the tactics
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.480]   would be this gratitude exercise you did to find them.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.400]   - The gratitude exercise that I did,
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.920]   this was several years ago now,
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.560]   I spent some time reflecting.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.880]   It was in one of these books that I read.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.320]   They recommended doing an exercise like this.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.960]   And just writing down all of the good things
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.160]   that have happened to me in my life.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.560]   And well, I think I maybe listed a hundred things.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.680]   And what was so interesting when I was reflecting
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.760]   on this list was how almost all of them
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.600]   were because of people in my life
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.680]   and not because of something that I did.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.800]   And that was a real wake-up call to realize
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.080]   that a lot of these great things and the people
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.960]   that were impactful on my life
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.080]   in both personal and professional things,
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.560]   they sort of fallen off the radar.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.320]   And not for good reasons, just 'cause I kind of forgot.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.280]   And the nice thing about computers
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.920]   is that they don't forget things.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.160]   And so where I think a lot of people go wrong,
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.920]   I've tried building a personal CRM product
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.680]   maybe five or six times.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.120]   And it's very hard.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:29.000]   I'm pretty confident that it's not a category
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.320]   that will ever work.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.120]   The main reason is when I talk to people about it,
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.440]   what they expect a personal CRM to do
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.280]   is automate all of their personal relationships.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.440]   And that's not what a personal CRM does.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:43.360]   It really just obliges you to spend a lot more time
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.640]   managing your personal relationships.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.160]   Instead of spending one hour per week,
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.520]   now you're spending 10 hours or 20 hours a week.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.240]   But you get a lot more value from it,
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.760]   and it's much more impactful.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.320]   So I spend an inordinate amount of my time
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.200]   just maintaining these relationships and talking to people
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.360]   and trying to see how I can help others.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.200]   But it definitely takes a lot of time.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.720]   There's no way to automate it.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.360]   - Is there a tool you're using to keep track of it all?
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.040]   You mentioned kind of the renaming of locations earlier.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.440]   - So honestly, I just use Airtable at this point.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.360]   There was a really interesting article,
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.840]   I forget where it was from,
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.680]   but it was with Peter Boyce from,
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.080]   he's a venture capitalist.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.760]   And what was interesting was how,
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.160]   I think it's called "Peter Boyce is a People Person,"
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.840]   I think is the name of the article.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.840]   What was interesting is how convergent
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.720]   our CRMs ended up being.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.360]   He ended up building his own.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.160]   They're 90% the same.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:38.520]   And so there's only a very limited subset of information
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.800]   that's actually useful.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.560]   Human brains are pretty good at networked thought.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.440]   I do think that almost all of this stuff
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.720]   will eventually be solved by some of these new AI tools
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:51.840]   because they're much better at contextual networked thought
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.120]   in a way that existing tools have not been.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.400]   But having lists of people and lists of groups of people,
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.840]   all of my friends who play board games in San Francisco,
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.440]   I have that list.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.880]   Location, San Francisco, tag with board games.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.840]   And I just have subsets of people
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:13.600]   that I want to stay in touch with on some regular basis,
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.760]   people that I meet up with for coffee.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.440]   And you just have these lists of people
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.360]   and their interests and their locations.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.440]   And it's really not much more complicated than that.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.680]   And it's just, it's the practice of every Sunday
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:29.880]   I have a calendar block to just look through the list.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.360]   That's the whole process.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.960]   I just look at all the names and I go,
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.040]   "Oh, Nick, I haven't talked to Nick in a long time.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.240]   "I should send him a note."
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.440]   And then I give him a call, we catch up,
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.800]   or it's like, "Oh, Anthony, yeah.
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.560]   "Man, I haven't seen him in like two years.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.700]   "I wonder, is he still in Miami?
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:47.600]   "I'm gonna check in."
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.160]   And he's like, "Oh, just moved to San Francisco."
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.080]   It's like, "Oh, we should get coffee sometime.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:51.920]   "Cool."
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.160]   It's a real event that happened.
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.600]   We're meeting for coffee soon.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.800]   So just learning that practice
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.480]   of just looking through the names.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.280]   Your brain is much better at coming up
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.800]   with connections of other people,
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.120]   things that you're working on
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.640]   and how it relates to those people
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.960]   than the computer will be,
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.600]   at least with current technology.
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.880]   So I have a similar list,
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.880]   which I didn't even think of as a personal CRM,
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:16.480]   which is just, I have a subset of my contacts on my phone
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.080]   and it's called walking calls.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.200]   And it's basically like, if I'm driving or walking,
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.520]   who are all the people that I'm like,
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.020]   "I wanna regularly connect with,"
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.180]   and I'll go in and scroll through them.
[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.960]   What it doesn't do a good job of,
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.720]   and there was an app back in the day called eTax,
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.640]   which actually, I think it was Howie Liu who might,
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.480]   I would have to look it up.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.040]   But there's a small chance that the person
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.520]   who actually started this company went on to start Airtable.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.840]   I'm gonna look this up after.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.940]   But the cool thing it would do
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:44.360]   was it would sync with your email
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.840]   and it would sync with your AT&T login
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.360]   because pre iMessage,
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.160]   all of your texts were routed through the carrier
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.840]   and it wouldn't know what's in the text,
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:55.480]   but it would just know when you last emailed or texted
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.280]   or called this person.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.640]   And the one thing that I want a CRM to do well,
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:03.380]   and maybe you have an EA do this,
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:06.520]   is just, I wanna find the people that I had let go.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.560]   And I don't know how many people are in your list,
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.540]   but I imagine it's not 10.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.380]   - Yeah.
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:12.200]   - Do you have a way to sort it
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.560]   by when you last talked to them?
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.320]   And is it too much burden to keep that date up to date?
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.760]   - It is too much burden to keep that up to date
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.280]   unless it's an automated tool.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.800]   I had actually, in some of the previous versions of CRMs,
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.280]   I had actually figured out a way
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:28.600]   to do a lot of those things.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.000]   So very tactically, the iMessage on your desktop
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.720]   is just like an unencrypted SQLite database
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.000]   that you can hack into and get all that data.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.540]   So you can have a script that just figures out
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:42.400]   when you contacted these people,
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.600]   syncs it with your CRM
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.500]   and what data you have on them there.
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.560]   Google Calendar has an API.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.400]   When you create an event, when you cancel an event,
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.480]   whatever you do, there's webhooks that you can tie into.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.480]   So you can then see,
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.760]   oh, I had a calendar event with this person,
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.860]   then that shows up.
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.520]   There's a lot of ways that you can do this stuff,
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:04.400]   but the reality is just, I didn't really, I didn't use it.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.600]   It was a lot of work and it just didn't add a lot of value,
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.040]   but these are totally achievable things
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.200]   if somebody wanted to build it.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.840]   - And one thing that I've heard you talk about before,
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.560]   which changed my perspective on, I don't know,
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.880]   random meetings was, I think my default assumption was,
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:23.560]   well, if I'm gonna prioritize meeting someone,
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.920]   let's prioritize someone
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.340]   who we have a lot of mutual friends with.
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.920]   Seemed like it made sense.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.580]   And then I heard you talk about why the opposite
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.660]   might actually be more beneficial.
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:38.080]   - So the have a lot of mutual friends with,
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.180]   there's a term called network homophily,
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:43.880]   which is how similar are all the people in your network?
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.840]   And I don't wanna say network homophily is a bad thing,
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.800]   but it definitely has trade-offs.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.160]   And you limit your exposure
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.140]   and you end up in a dense network.
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.800]   There's a concept called eigenvector centrality,
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.980]   which is really this idea of,
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:58.720]   it's not just how many people do you know,
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.640]   but it's the second and third order effect
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.720]   of how many people do each of them know.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.860]   If you're connected to all of these super connected people
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.880]   in each of these dense networks,
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.900]   you are a much more connected person.
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:11.220]   You will likely be able to deliver
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:13.580]   a lot more value in your life.
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:16.220]   You can use the network connectivity
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:20.700]   as maybe a proxy for potential quality of the conversation.
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.820]   But I think there are a lot of other ways
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.880]   to try to inject that diversity into it.
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.500]   In New York, I used to host these dinners,
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.640]   hopefully I'll start doing these again in San Francisco,
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.860]   called second degree dinners.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.340]   Have you ever heard of this format?
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:36.540]   It's pretty fun.
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.260]   The idea is you start with,
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.580]   let's say you wanna end up with 12 people.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:43.580]   So you start with like a core group of four people,
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.740]   and each of you invites somebody
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.780]   that you are confident nobody else knows.
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:51.820]   And then you ask that person to invite somebody
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:54.740]   that they think nobody else in the group will know.
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.640]   And so you end up with 12 people,
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.800]   most of whom don't know each other.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.640]   And so you--
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:01.340]   - But everyone whom knows one person.
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:03.100]   - That's right, but everyone knows one person.
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:03.980]   That's right.
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:08.240]   And so it is almost necessarily going to be
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:12.220]   a much more diverse and interesting group of people
[01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:15.460]   than you would ordinarily have at a dinner party.
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:17.620]   - Which would be your seven best friends.
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.840]   - It would be exactly, it's your seven best friends.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.100]   I host a lot of different types of dinners
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:22.940]   for these sorts of things,
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.420]   and each of them has their own intent.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.700]   And that one is more like,
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.260]   it is rare that you would host some sort of event
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:31.820]   where you have like a sculptor,
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:34.820]   a standup comedian, an investment banker.
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:37.220]   You just have like this completely random,
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:38.660]   eclectic mix of people
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:41.400]   that would otherwise not have interacted.
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.080]   And those can be a lot of fun.
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.840]   - I hope to maybe,
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.360]   well, I guess I may have had no too many people.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.200]   - Yeah.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.080]   - No too many people to get the invite.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.180]   Though I do fall in this new subset of,
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.340]   once you have children, you're like,
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.180]   well, now I need people
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:57.540]   who are willing to go to dinner at 5.30 or at nine
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:58.540]   when the kids are asleep.
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:59.940]   But I wanna circle back.
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.500]   We spent a little bit of time on some tools.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.660]   We talked about using voice delegation.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:05.280]   I think you and I share,
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.360]   maybe a passion is the right word, I'm not sure,
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.140]   but for optimal communication
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:13.000]   and productivity and tools and everything.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.700]   Let's talk about some of the other tools you use
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:18.780]   to organize information, access it quickly,
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:21.240]   and spend less time on things
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.380]   that you don't wanna spend more time on.
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.620]   - Yeah, so Notion is a really good tool
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:28.900]   for keeping track of documentation internally.
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:29.900]   You probably know this
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:32.060]   'cause I imagine you are pretty deep into Notion,
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.580]   but there's the very simple version of,
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:35.300]   there's a page, it's a wiki,
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.260]   but then there's the advanced version of Notion
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:39.420]   with databases, linking.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:40.620]   You have all of this.
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:44.760]   Notion is a really flexible, very advanced tool.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:47.500]   If you go deep into the inner workings of Notion,
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.620]   there's a lot more functionality in Notion
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:50.960]   than most people realize.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.740]   - They recently added automation,
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.640]   which I found for the podcast,
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.380]   every time I source a new deal,
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:59.860]   I favorite a tweet, it shows up in a database.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.220]   As soon as we start working on it,
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.940]   it posts it to Slack, to a channel.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.700]   You could do a lot.
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:06.980]   Do you use it in your personal life also?
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:07.820]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:12.820]   My wife and I, we do a weekly family priorities
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:16.420]   where we have a list of, some of it's just logistics,
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.540]   like travel and expenses,
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:22.420]   and some of it is also things that bothered us
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.760]   during the week that we want to talk about.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.000]   And we have all of it.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.360]   It's like a weekly running one-on-one doc
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.800]   that we discuss every week.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.800]   It's been very, very useful.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:35.240]   - I've gotten so many requests from people to explain,
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:37.600]   do a whole episode on how I use Notion.
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.080]   And I'm like, I don't even know where to start.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:39.920]   - Yeah, totally.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.880]   - It feels so personal.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.660]   It's like, well, I want to take a trip.
[01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:44.760]   So I make a database and I put all the trips in the database
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.040]   and then each one has a page and each one has a checklist.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.200]   And it's like, you could go down these rabbit holes,
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.840]   but at the highest level,
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.040]   you can combine everything
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.520]   you would normally put in a spreadsheet,
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.480]   but in a database, which could do more.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.480]   Everything you would put in a document, but could do more.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.980]   You can link it all together and search it.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:02.760]   And I don't know, that tool--
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.440]   - You can publish it as a website.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.460]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:08.720]   - Okay, I know we both use email
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.240]   as kind of a triaging automated system.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.060]   I'm using Superhuman.
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.900]   I know you have used Superhuman,
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:19.220]   are considering building something or building it right now.
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:21.620]   How do you think first before the systems
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.220]   just in general about email?
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:26.220]   Because I think all of us work personal,
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:27.660]   feel overwhelmed by email.
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:29.740]   - We'll start with the good things about email,
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:34.500]   which is email is threaded and email is quantized.
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:37.900]   So we'll take Slack as a good opposite example.
[01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:41.680]   Slack is effectively a superset of text messaging.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.380]   It is a relentless fire hose of information.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:48.060]   Anyone who's worked in a company that uses Slack,
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.860]   if you go offline for like three days
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:55.180]   and you come back to Slack, you feel hopelessly behind.
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:58.240]   And you have to like scroll and figure out what did I miss?
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.820]   'Cause it's just, it's all coming.
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:01.860]   It's like being in a WhatsApp group.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.700]   Like I just checked earlier today,
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.340]   there's some thread that I don't even,
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:07.540]   I haven't even checked what it is yet
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:08.620]   that must have blown up.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:11.820]   I have like 128 messages on WhatsApp.
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:14.020]   It's like, am I really gonna be able
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:15.460]   to filter through all of those
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:17.420]   to see if any of them are relevant?
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.700]   Probably not.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:21.060]   You just end up muting them and then they go away.
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:23.060]   So the nice thing about email
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:25.380]   is that because it's threaded and quantized,
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:29.220]   each idea is encapsulated in one item.
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.140]   People can respond on that one item,
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:34.100]   but it doesn't impact you anymore.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.220]   You could just mute.
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:37.720]   It's like, oh, I don't wanna engage in this topic.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.500]   And you can delete it, you can mute it,
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:40.700]   whatever you wanna do,
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:43.200]   but you don't miss all of the information
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.900]   from all of the people.
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.580]   So the problem with email is that
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:51.660]   the signal to noise ratio in email is extremely low,
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:54.580]   partly because anyone can just send you an email.
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:55.420]   I was actually talking to somebody
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:56.460]   about this very recently,
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:00.380]   that all of these marketing agencies
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.260]   with dashes in their URL,
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:05.460]   like does anybody actually open those?
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.040]   I cannot imagine that sending this much spam email
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.060]   is delivering value for anybody, but it must be.
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.200]   And there's just so much of it
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.960]   and it's so hard to stay on top of it.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:17.160]   So that's the major problem with email,
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.740]   is that anyone else can effectively impose
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:23.760]   their priority on you, onto your attention.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.560]   I don't have a great solution for it yet.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.580]   We have really tried a lot of different tools.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:31.200]   We ended up building our own comms tool
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.920]   to try to solve this problem.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.240]   We're planning to externalize it, probably in Q1.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.240]   My hope is that it'll be a drop-in replacement
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:41.240]   for Superhuman and Slack
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.960]   and really any other workplace communication tool
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.160]   people are using.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.320]   Almost all of these tools are designed by people
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.980]   who are either social media product managers
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:52.560]   in their past life or video game designers.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.360]   They're not people who are designing tools
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:56.640]   with deep work as the major focus.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.280]   That's really been the major effort
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.760]   that we've been working on there.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:03.400]   - Within email, one thing that I think has helped.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.240]   So yes, everyone has access to your inbox.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.480]   It can be overwhelming.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.680]   The more you can view it as a thing
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.560]   that you can process quickly,
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.600]   the less you dwell on it.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:14.320]   When I watch some people manage their inbox,
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.760]   it's I open an email.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:18.480]   I open it, you know, I decide, I think about it.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.600]   And mine is like, first, I'll just go through the inbox
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.800]   and I'll be like, what can I just quickly delete?
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.680]   And like keyboard shortcut,
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.080]   and maybe it's not delete and archive,
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:28.160]   but it's like J, J, J, E, E, E, J, J.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.120]   Like I'm just trying to get everything out.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.840]   I do like one pass.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.520]   I know this breaks a lot of people's principles,
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:36.480]   which is like only touch an email twice or once.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.120]   But I'm like one pass, get rid of all the bad stuff
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:40.960]   that I don't even need.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.480]   And that's something that you can usually solve
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.120]   through delegation as well.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:45.960]   Then when I'm going through it,
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.760]   it's like each email is going to go somewhere.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.200]   It's either going to be quickly replied to,
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.840]   or be filed to deal with later,
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.440]   or be hidden to come back later and dealt with.
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.880]   Being able to do that quickly,
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.000]   I think is an underrated skill.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:00.840]   I think a lot of people are like,
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.960]   well, I don't need to be the productivity export
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:06.520]   and learn the keyboard shortcuts, you know, superhuman,
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.800]   or any tool like that that I'd have to pay for
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.680]   to just use my inbox.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:13.680]   I don't know how to say anything other than like,
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.440]   I think you're wrong.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.560]   - There's actually really good data on this,
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.360]   which I'm happy to share.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.200]   Like there's so much data
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.200]   on how much more productive people are using hotkeys.
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.640]   It is the, or keyboard shortcuts.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.840]   Depending on what your role is,
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.080]   there's a bunch of different studies
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.760]   trying for different tasks.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:39.120]   People automatically, with a very short period of training,
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.440]   see something like a 10 to 40% increase in productivity
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:45.240]   for the rest of their lives,
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.440]   just by learning these shortcuts.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.840]   If you're in a role where you're doing
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.640]   a lot of manual clicking and typing,
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.640]   and you're in a particular tool a lot,
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.120]   that's on the higher end,
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:01.040]   if you just process email occasionally, it still is useful.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.720]   There's a tremendous amount of evidence
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:05.720]   for why learning these is such a positive thing.
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.520]   And it's, everybody needs to do it,
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.000]   is really what it comes down to.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.480]   For very little effort, you get free productivity forever.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.040]   - And this is not just true for email.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.000]   Like most apps you use on your computer,
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.080]   and I imagine everyone knows how to copy and paste.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:20.920]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:24.280]   - And like, take how simple copy and paste makes your life.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:27.600]   Instead of dragging your cursor up and clicking the icon,
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.080]   that applies everywhere.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.720]   I remember working in finance,
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.240]   I went to an Excel training,
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:34.720]   and it was like, you can go deep
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.520]   if you're in a specific area,
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.480]   and it will also greatly increase your productivity.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.200]   But I think at a bare minimum, email shortcuts,
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.960]   which for some reason, even Gmail,
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:46.520]   you have to manually enable.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:48.800]   So go enable it, go look up,
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:49.880]   you used to be able to buy stickers
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:50.840]   and put them on your keyboard,
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.400]   but I think you can pretty quickly learn them,
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:54.960]   is such an unlock.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:55.960]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:58.000]   - And within Slack or whatever app you use,
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:58.840]   I would encourage that.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.400]   And then broad computer-wise,
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:04.760]   just the number of people that I've witnessed
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.800]   not using on a Mac, Command + Tab,
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.360]   Control + Tab or Alt + Tab on a PC,
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:13.640]   just to be able to jump between windows within an app,
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.680]   within windows outside of an app.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.240]   Maybe Chrome, to be able to switch through tabs
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.960]   or whatever browser you're using.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.400]   - Yeah, a few other things related to that,
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.200]   I would say Text Expander,
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.560]   which I know is something that you're familiar with.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:26.880]   Text Expander is an awesome one
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:27.800]   when you're using snippets
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:30.160]   across all these different platforms.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.600]   - And the principle there for people who don't know,
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:36.440]   you can create a piece of text that is your address.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.200]   You can have a shortcut for it
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:39.920]   to be able to drop your address in.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.920]   And if you don't want to download an app and do this,
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.440]   I actually use just the default Mac text replacement.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.480]   So if I type ch @ symbol,
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.320]   it replaces it with my email address.
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.640]   So there are a few things
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.000]   where I've actually just built it into iOS,
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.640]   which is great, it works on your phone,
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.880]   which I don't know if Text Expander works on your phone,
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:31:59.720]   and they might--
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:00.680]   - I use it on my phone, yeah.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:01.760]   - But that's the hack on a phone,
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.720]   is you can go in and create a keyboard
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:07.080]   that would just like turn OMW into on my way,
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.160]   or whatever things you might say a lot.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.040]   Or you can use Text Expander, which has more functionality.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.480]   Superhuman has snippets built into it.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.280]   - Nice thing about Text Expander,
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:21.280]   I don't use the specific key shortcuts, like ch @.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:24.400]   I pretty much exclusively use it, the search functionality.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:28.960]   So you can just paste the entire snippet in,
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.680]   and it will just infer as you're typing.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:33.800]   You can start the search on Text Expander,
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.120]   and as you're typing in words,
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.960]   it filters it down to the one that you want.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:40.320]   So you don't have to memorize nearly as many hotkeys.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.840]   - So I use Alfred instead of Text Expander for this.
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:43.680]   - Cool.
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:46.880]   - And the thing I love is that it merges your snippets
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.000]   with your history of your clipboard.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000]   So with the same keyboard shortcut,
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.440]   I pull up anything I've ever copied and pasted
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:56.800]   in the last, I don't know how long it goes, 30 days,
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:00.280]   with a priority for anything that's a snippet.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:04.000]   So I find myself, and the clipboard functionality
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.040]   works with like photos.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.960]   So if I wanna go screen grab three things,
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.680]   I screen grab, screen grab, screen grab,
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:14.800]   and I can go in and like, I think it's option command C,
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.720]   pulls up, and I'm like, I wanna paste this,
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.960]   paste this, paste this.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.020]   And so it combines the two.
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:21.520]   But Text Expander, I also don't use
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.040]   the keyboard shortcuts for it.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.040]   It's more about being able to have a database of things
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.240]   that I wanna throw in.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.080]   And then I use snippets within Superhuman,
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.880]   which I could probably combine those.
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.960]   I can't remember, but I think it includes
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:35.200]   like some HTML or hybrid formatting.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:39.160]   So if you wanted to say like, here's a link to my website,
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:42.120]   when you paste it, you could actually have the HTML in there.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.480]   I can't remember if Alfred does that,
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.320]   but I believe Text Expander does.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.160]   So that's one.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:48.000]   - The thing I always try to help people do
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.120]   is instead of using their cursor
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.820]   and going down into their dock to open each app,
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:55.460]   they do command space, and then you type the thing.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.200]   It's a very coder way to do it,
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:58.800]   but it's much, much, much faster.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.440]   Instead of like going down,
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:04.960]   which of these 40 icons is the one that I want?
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:07.600]   And it really slows things down when you have to do that.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.800]   - Yeah, my dock is now like five things.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:10.640]   - Yeah, mine too.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.680]   - Because I just searched for it.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:13.920]   I've disabled Spotlight for Alfred,
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.680]   which is like a tool to do the same.
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.040]   There's another tool that I'll,
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:18.260]   if I can find it, I'll put in the show notes,
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.080]   that people have recommended.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:20.920]   I believe it has--
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:21.960]   - Could be Raycast. - Raycast.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:24.020]   I knew it had the word Ray in it as an alternative,
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:25.520]   which I've heard great things about.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:29.440]   The one thing we didn't talk about in depth is calendaring.
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.520]   And you mentioned earlier, like doing an audit,
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:33.360]   making sure things are in your calendar.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:36.760]   I wanna talk about it because I think I'm terrible at it.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.080]   On the whole, I looked at this list.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.120]   I was like, I'm great at Notion.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:40.040]   I'm great at email.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.420]   I'm great at a lot of productivity things.
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:44.560]   If you look at my calendar, there's like four things on it.
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.600]   And sometimes my EA's like,
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:47.440]   oh, you need to do this thing.
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.320]   She'll put it on my calendar.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.480]   And I just don't, I'm like, well, why would I do it?
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.720]   I could do it later.
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:55.680]   How have you created discipline to use your calendar,
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.120]   both as a place of what to do
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.400]   and as a record of what you did?
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.920]   - I wish I had a better answer
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.480]   other than to have discipline to do that.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.520]   Let's say I ostensibly set a priority
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:13.520]   as I wanna make sure that I am spending a lot of time
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.280]   recruiting new engineers.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.060]   That's my priority for this month.
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:20.160]   Having that feedback mechanism of my EA
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.800]   giving me my monthly report and saying,
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:25.580]   you spent one hour doing this thing this whole month.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.960]   That's a real wake-up call for me to say, oh, wow,
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.280]   I need to move things around
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:33.400]   because my stated priority is clearly not reflected
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.840]   in my empirical record of priorities.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:38.860]   Having that feedback loop I think helps with the discipline
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:42.240]   because it allows me to reorient my time.
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.880]   It probably started much more so
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.000]   in the retroactively capturing what I'm doing.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.040]   And then I started proactively looking into the future
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.660]   and projecting what I would be spending my time on.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:56.440]   So that's probably the order
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.840]   in which that was more of a thing
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:00.440]   because this whole process for me actually started
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:03.760]   when I was doing a lot of software consulting work.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.920]   And it was just a pragmatic aspect of,
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:10.120]   I need to know who to bill how much time for.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.100]   That's really where it started for me
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.440]   was I started keeping track historically
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.120]   of how much time I was spending on each project.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.440]   And then I realized that I now have to project
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.740]   into the future how many projects can I manage
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.080]   at the same time.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.040]   And I would add those blocks into my calendar.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.480]   And I realized I can only support this many projects.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.360]   So I would say that's probably the order
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:32.880]   that I would approach it if you were to give it a shot.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:36.040]   - And are you naturally not a procrastinator?
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.180]   - I'm very much a procrastinator.
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:41.200]   Part of the answer is I create a lot of scaffolding
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:44.740]   around how I spend my time and what my priorities are.
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:46.040]   I can give a recent example,
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.920]   something I need to deliver by next Wednesday.
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:51.420]   I'm not gonna put it on my calendar for tomorrow
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:54.280]   because I know I'm just gonna not do it.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.480]   So I'd usually, I'll put it on my calendar
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:58.060]   probably for Tuesday.
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.060]   And I think it's gonna take me about four hours.
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:02.720]   So I block off four hours on Tuesday
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:04.320]   'cause I have to deliver it by Wednesday.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.620]   I'm not gonna be super optimistic
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.320]   about what is gonna happen
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.920]   'cause I have enough of these empirical records
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.080]   to know how this pattern goes
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.600]   is I'm just gonna not do it until Tuesday anyway.
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.760]   So I might as well just put it on Tuesday.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.280]   Being able to project how you're spending your time,
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:25.140]   it brings procrastination into much more focus.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:28.080]   Let's say you know you need to do this by Wednesday
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.240]   and you say, yeah, I'll just deal with this later.
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.840]   I have plenty of time.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.080]   But if you look at your calendar
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.400]   and you realize that actually you do not,
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:39.640]   you don't have any time to do this between now and next week.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:41.680]   You have to figure out how to move your calendar around
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:43.840]   that it brings it much more into focus
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.280]   and makes procrastination a lot harder.
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:47.200]   Because you would just realize
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.760]   that you either have to cut things
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.600]   from what your current calendar is
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.320]   or you have to bring it further back in time
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.520]   to be able to do it earlier.
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:56.440]   - My challenge might actually be less
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:59.400]   that I don't wanna do the important thing
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:01.760]   but that some random thing has come up
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.200]   that I'm excited about.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.400]   And to go full circle with an example,
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:09.440]   recently I realized that someone
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:12.440]   who as a company we owe money to sent me a bill,
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.600]   sat in the inbox, forgot to pay it.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.520]   And I was like, oh, there should just be a system
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:19.600]   where someone could, you know, when I work with vendors,
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.600]   I send them an email to like invoicing at
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:25.600]   and I send them our invoice and it gets paid.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.880]   So I was like, oh, I need something like that.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.200]   And I was like, oh, what are the tools?
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:31.160]   Oh, well, QuickBooks can do it and bill.com can do it
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.520]   and Melio can do it and a few banks have it.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.160]   And I was like, ooh, I wanna go play with all the,
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:36.720]   and I was like, I just got excited.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.040]   So to go back, I'm sure many people listening
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.960]   are like that sounds like a horrible task.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:42.920]   I would never wanna spend my free time
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.440]   researching accounting software to track accounts payable.
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.520]   - Sounds like a really good task to delegate to an EA.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:52.160]   - For you, for me, I was like, it was exciting.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.840]   Like I was, how you might feel programming,
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.840]   I felt evaluating accounting tools.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.320]   And so I'm like, gosh, today I have to do this thing,
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.560]   but this thing that's really exciting.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.440]   I think maybe what I need to get better at is like,
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.400]   it's actually less about when I put the time
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.280]   for the thing I do.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.400]   It's about capturing the thing I'm excited about
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:15.000]   and putting it somewhere so that I know I get to do it.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.360]   - Yeah, I do this all the time.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.120]   If I was to show you my calendar now,
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.880]   you would see there's two CSS properties
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:24.280]   that somehow I just missed that they were released,
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.880]   which is I've been using Flexbox for a lot of things
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:28.800]   and grid is now a thing.
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:29.920]   Somehow I missed that,
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:34.560]   which is a really cool way of orienting items in CSS.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:36.480]   The other one that I missed is clamp.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.180]   Somehow I missed when that got released,
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:39.400]   which effectively does away
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:42.360]   with all these really tedious media queries.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.880]   And I was super excited when I discovered this,
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:47.360]   how did I miss that this exists?
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:52.360]   And I felt really motivated to do it at that exact moment.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:53.840]   But then I looked at my calendar,
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:55.240]   it's like, I don't have time.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:58.620]   So I put an hour on my calendar.
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:00.160]   The next time I had availability,
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.080]   which was like three days later,
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.000]   I put the links in there.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.760]   I was able to externalize it and say,
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.540]   I'm not gonna forget about this.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:08.720]   It's in my calendar.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.000]   I will eventually get to it
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.480]   and I'm gonna learn these things.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:12.840]   - Have you gotten to do that yet?
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.400]   - No, I think it's, I think it might be today actually.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:19.540]   - Oh, I won't keep you from CSS,
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:20.920]   which similarly sounds like something
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.400]   I enjoy going down rabbit hole.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.160]   I think I just enjoy going down
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.160]   learning rabbit holes too much.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:27.680]   So that makes it just super challenging.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.320]   - And I think where a lot of people struggle with this,
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:31.280]   and this is certainly where I used to struggle with this,
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.040]   is that it feels like if you don't do it now,
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:36.240]   it's gonna just fall into the void.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.520]   But if you put it on your calendar
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:40.160]   and you're disciplined about sticking to your calendar,
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.320]   you will get to it.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.800]   The nice thing about calendars
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.760]   is that things happen linearly.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.080]   Like time will elapse.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:48.680]   You will eventually get to the item
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.560]   and you will have to do something with it.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.460]   - I think one example that actually helped
[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:54.700]   when it comes to email,
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:56.080]   a lot of people that are listening
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.740]   probably leave their email open all day,
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:00.840]   which I think is a habit that sometimes I'm better
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:02.880]   and sometimes I'm worse at sticking to.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.960]   And I thought, gosh, if I close my email,
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.680]   then I'll miss something.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:09.040]   What I found was when I don't look at my email
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.360]   for three hours,
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.960]   it's like I have so much exciting things to see,
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.600]   like that joy that you would get these little blips of,
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.840]   instead of getting the little blips, you got a big one.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.860]   And I actually liked it more.
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:20.560]   So right now I haven't looked at my email
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.600]   our entire conversation,
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.800]   and I'm like, ooh, I'm kind of excited
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:24.560]   to go see what's in there
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.080]   and probably archive most of it.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.560]   - So there's a useful tool,
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:30.880]   not coincidentally, the tool that we're building
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:33.120]   has a feature called Scheduled Delivery,
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.320]   which batches your messages
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.280]   so that even if you checked, you wouldn't see anything.
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:39.440]   It actually hides them from you
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:41.440]   until it's time that you specify.
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.040]   If you write out that you want to process email
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.200]   from one o'clock to two o'clock,
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.200]   it'll just hide everything from you.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:50.280]   There's a way to break the glass
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.000]   and get the data if you want it,
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.040]   but it'll hide it from you until that moment.
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:56.640]   So you don't feel this urge to compulsively check.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:58.640]   There's a tool that I use
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:00.280]   that really inspired a lot of this,
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.080]   which is called Mailman.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.320]   I think their website's Mailman HQ.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.680]   Very, very simple product.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.400]   All it does is it batches your email.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.080]   And so you say, I want my email to be delivered to me
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.120]   at one o'clock and five o'clock, and that's it.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.360]   And so what's nice is it's useful
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:18.040]   to think about these things cognitively
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:20.800]   in terms of dopamine loops.
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:24.320]   If you check your email and there's nothing there,
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.200]   you don't get that dopamine reward.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.640]   But if you constantly check,
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:29.160]   it's like, ooh, new information.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.160]   Ooh, there's a little dot.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:31.000]   Ooh, I can check that.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.520]   I feel like I just did something.
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.640]   I marked junk mail as done.
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:36.320]   I've achieved something.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.680]   You get that dopamine reinforcement.
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.840]   And what's nice about these tools
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.920]   is that if you check it enough times
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.400]   and there's nothing new there,
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:45.720]   you eventually just give up,
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:49.920]   and that compulsive behavioral trait just evaporates,
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:52.440]   and you don't feel that compulsive need to check anymore.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:55.120]   The data on this stuff is really frightening.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.080]   There's some data around use of Slack
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.200]   and other workplace communications tools like email.
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:03.320]   For knowledge workers, I think it was something like
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:07.880]   60% of knowledge workers cannot go more than six minutes
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:10.080]   without checking a communications tool.
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:12.720]   I think it was almost half of knowledge workers
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:16.240]   never at any point get more than 30 minutes
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.160]   of uninterrupted time ever,
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:21.760]   which I cannot even fathom how people get work done,
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.640]   especially doing software development.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:24.960]   It's just impossible.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:29.720]   - I regularly miss messages during the workday
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:32.200]   'cause I have my phone set to go into work mode,
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.560]   which doesn't surface anything.
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.640]   I do think that,
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:38.000]   and I don't know if you're building this into your tool,
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.440]   there are probably a few things,
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:41.040]   and I don't know how to figure out what they are
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.200]   'cause I don't have an obvious rule set
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.000]   that it's like I would like to know about that.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.120]   You could probably filter it on keyword or sender,
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:51.280]   but there are some things that I do wanna know about.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:54.360]   And then there are some things like the worst is on Slack.
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:57.200]   There is no way to have,
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.600]   and if anyone listening knows a way, let me know,
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:03.320]   a Google Drive integration
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.080]   that will notify you of some things,
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:08.080]   which I shared something to someone and it wasn't shared,
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.960]   and I meant to share it,
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:12.480]   but I went and said anyone can edit it in our org,
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.360]   but I forgot to say with the link.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.960]   And I got a push on Slack that was like,
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.000]   hey, do you wanna grant access?
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.200]   I was like, oh, this is so helpful.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.040]   It was early in the morning.
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.120]   I could hit one button, grant access.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.480]   But then someone was editing a doc,
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:25.720]   and every minute I got a, this person edited,
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:26.560]   this person edited.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.400]   I was like, I don't, this is crazy.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:29.800]   Suppress it all.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.240]   I would love to see some ability
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.160]   to kind of filter out that stuff,
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:36.360]   but let the you missed a payment come through
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:37.440]   that I need to resolve.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.760]   - The signal to noise problem in communications
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.600]   is just fundamentally hard.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.520]   We do have some specific heuristics
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.640]   on how we're solving that problem.
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:49.640]   When it's intra-org, you can largely trust
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.840]   the other people in your org
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:54.560]   to be responsible stewards of your time.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.440]   And so you can't do this with email.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.880]   Like if you let every spam marketer set the priority,
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:03.360]   like everything, priority zero.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.720]   Interrupt him immediately.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.800]   This is the highest priority thing.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.600]   You need to work with our agency.
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.800]   It's another one of these.
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.400]   But within your company,
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.280]   people are usually pretty good about setting something
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:15.600]   to the right level of priority,
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.600]   or setting a date in the future
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.160]   is one of the things that we were working on,
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:23.800]   is you can say this will become high priority on Wednesday
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:25.320]   if you haven't done it by Wednesday.
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.440]   (laughs)
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:28.000]   You can specify some of these things
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.880]   where you have like an escalation path
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:32.080]   over some time period.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.720]   So, yeah, it's a fundamentally hard problem
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.600]   and I don't think any of these tools have solved it.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:37.800]   - But I've also played with a little,
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:39.920]   is around AI and all these things.
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:43.480]   I'm curious how AI has fit into,
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:46.280]   to go back to our earlier conversation, delegation,
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:49.960]   and how much you, or even your EAs,
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:51.400]   have been able to lean into it
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:53.840]   as a way to become more efficient.
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.200]   - It's incredibly helpful for things
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.520]   like doing meeting summaries.
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.120]   I don't think that we're leveraging it
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.920]   as much as we could be.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:03.440]   It would be interesting,
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.720]   this is maybe a question I should just ask
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:07.080]   some folks at Athena,
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:09.640]   is that if Athena is a staffing agency,
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.920]   or some of these other companies,
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:14.320]   if they view themselves as staffing agencies, that's fine.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:18.520]   But it would be interesting as this category evolves,
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:19.880]   if they view themselves much more
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:22.360]   as a task completion company.
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:26.400]   And the abstraction of having people and staff
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:29.640]   is actually less important than the completion of tasks
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.280]   on some regular basis.
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:34.960]   You can imagine a world where you record
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:38.040]   loom of your workflow throughout the entire day,
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:41.160]   and there's some AI process that analyzes that video,
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:43.280]   and then recommends how it could automate
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.120]   half of the things that you did.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:46.680]   And it wouldn't require a person,
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:48.680]   and you would just say like, accept.
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:52.040]   Accept this delegation forever at zero cost.
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:53.440]   That would be pretty awesome.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.360]   And I don't think we're that far away from it.
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.560]   I would bet within the next 10 years,
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.920]   we have something that's fairly similar to that.
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.080]   - Right now, my solution has been
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.480]   to get a good sense of the things that I wanna do,
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:09.080]   and then encourage my EA not to think
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:11.080]   that using AI is cheating.
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:12.600]   You know, it's like, this is a tool.
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:14.960]   If it can make you more efficient, use it.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:17.680]   And I've found that it's not good
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.320]   at necessarily doing things, the execution of things,
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:24.960]   but it's fairly good at the brainstorming
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:26.160]   and thinking of things.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.760]   What topics would I wanna talk about?
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.600]   A use case that I'd never even considered
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:32.440]   that a friend of mine recently did was,
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:33.880]   he took all of his biomarkers
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.680]   from his most recent health tests.
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.760]   He went and got all these labs done,
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:39.520]   and he was like, talk to me about them.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.600]   Here's all of them.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:41.960]   Here's everything about me.
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:43.360]   Here's the history.
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:44.880]   What can you interpret from this?
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:45.720]   - Oh, cool.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:48.680]   - It didn't even cross my mind to take my blood labs
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:50.880]   and put them into ChatGPT and see what it said.
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:52.920]   And there's lots of use cases you'll find as a parent
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.000]   where you're like, oh, make up a story
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.960]   about a dragon who likes fish tacos
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:58.240]   because that's what my child wants to talk about.
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.600]   So you'll get to there.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.720]   But I've started trying to think about,
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:03.320]   okay, it could be used for brainstorming.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.320]   It could be used for analyzing stuff.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:08.320]   And as these app stores and plugins get better and better
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.720]   and it can do stuff, I'm super interested.
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:13.520]   Right now, I'm like, it's not as good at the doing
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:17.000]   as the thinking, but I hope it gets there.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.080]   And one tool we didn't talk about,
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:19.720]   I don't know how much you use Zapier,
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:22.640]   but I would say that is a tool that,
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.640]   for the longest time, I looked at as like,
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.480]   how would I use it?
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:26.320]   It was almost like an EA.
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.160]   It was like, how would I use it?
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.360]   I would never use it, I would never use it.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:31.280]   And then I adopt it and I've got all of these processes,
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:33.200]   like doing all of these things.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.520]   Actually, the way a friend of mine uses it
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.440]   is in the beginning of his voice notes,
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:37.680]   he just says like a category.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.760]   He's like work or food or health.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.320]   And then he reads this voice note.
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.160]   The voice note gets transcribed through whisper memos
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:49.080]   or whisper notes and gets sent to a Zapier email,
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.640]   which looks at the first five words.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:53.240]   And if one of these words is there,
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.320]   categorizes it and puts it in this place in Notion
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:59.880]   and loops in the right person and all of those things.
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.920]   So it's pretty powerful.
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:04.440]   And I feel like I slept on it for too long,
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.280]   thinking it was only a tool for business
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:09.920]   and realized there's just an infinite number of ways
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.680]   that you can loop together personal things.
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:12.720]   - For sure.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:15.800]   Yeah, it's funny, the use of AI in a lot of these things
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.640]   and viewing it as cheating is,
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.840]   this came up in a conversation,
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:20.320]   I think as recently as last week
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.720]   within our engineering team,
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.480]   because we were interviewing engineers.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.240]   We did a live coding exercise
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.200]   and I don't know if you've seen Copilot.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.040]   - Yeah.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.320]   - But it writes a lot of the code for you.
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:33.320]   And we had, basically we discovered last week
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:35.520]   that our live coding exercise no longer works
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:38.720]   because Copilot will just give you the answer.
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:41.760]   So we weren't sure like, do we make him turn off Copilot?
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:45.400]   And I mentioned to the team, we just need to adapt.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:46.760]   We need to change the expectations.
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.640]   We need to do adapt our live coding exercise
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:50.680]   because I remember when I was interviewing
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:53.960]   for programming jobs years ago,
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:55.120]   the guy who was interviewing me
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:57.560]   was more of an old school engineer.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.840]   And he felt like my use of an IDE,
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.160]   which I think at the time was Atom,
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:02.400]   he felt like that was cheating.
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:04.760]   So we had to move to a whiteboard to do this whole thing.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:07.240]   It's like, nobody writes actual code.
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.760]   I don't know, he's like, well, why?
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:10.200]   Are you sure that this executes?
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.520]   It's like, I don't know.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:13.640]   That's what my IDE tells me.
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.600]   It's mostly right.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.480]   If there's any errors, it would tell me.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:20.000]   And you just have to adapt and get used to the tools.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.320]   Honestly, I've been back in the code base
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:23.880]   for a few months now.
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:27.440]   These new tools using GPT-4 and Copilot,
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:31.640]   I'm legitimately double the productivity that I was before.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.800]   That's not an exaggeration.
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:35.480]   The amount of output, the reduction
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.600]   and the number of times I get stuck on things,
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:40.360]   I'm legitimately producing twice as much as I was
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:42.560]   before all of this stuff was available.
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.160]   - I'm not an engineer by any means,
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.200]   but I would say I'm comfortable enough to figure out
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.720]   what code's trying to do.
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:49.760]   And I was like, I have this idea.
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:52.160]   I wanna build a page on our website
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.720]   where I can pull in a list of credit cards.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:56.240]   We didn't talk at all about points and miles,
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.080]   which we don't need to, but I'm a nerd about it.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:59.760]   And I was like, I wanna be able to build a place
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:03.640]   where we can filter and sort and look at signup bonuses
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:06.280]   and reference a table of what points are worth
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:09.120]   and determine how much it's worth and all this stuff.
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.720]   And I literally built a site that does all of this.
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:15.560]   And I am 100% sure it was well beyond the scope
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.920]   of what I was able to do on my own.
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.840]   Because I feel like when it comes to writing JavaScript,
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.720]   I'm like, nope, I'm not great there.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:24.000]   And I was just blown away.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.040]   The one challenge is when something breaks 80% of the time,
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:29.680]   you could be like, hey, this is how it's broken.
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:30.520]   Can you help me?
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.320]   And then there's like 20% of the time where you're like,
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:33.880]   no, and then you do.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:35.840]   But funny enough, you think that this tool
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.800]   will do the same thing every time.
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:40.360]   So I'll revert to where it started working.
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.440]   I'll copy it into a new chat and say,
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:44.480]   hey, I have this thing and it's not working.
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:46.920]   And the same tool that couldn't solve it,
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:47.760]   will solve it.
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:50.200]   - It will self-reflect when you say,
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.680]   are you sure that's right?
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:53.280]   And I was like, oh, you know what?
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:54.120]   - I missed something.
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:55.040]   - No, I missed something.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:55.880]   That is weird.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:57.000]   That is super weird.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.360]   Yeah, happens all the time.
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:01.680]   - So we talked a lot about how tracking what you're doing,
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.520]   whether it's time is interesting.
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:06.680]   I just briefly talked about putting biomarkers into GPT
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.420]   and what you can learn from them.
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.420]   We could probably have an entire podcast
[01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:11.820]   that's completely separate from this
[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:14.740]   about tracking your personal health data
[01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:16.240]   and learning from it.
[01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:18.140]   And you referenced levels a few times.
[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:20.020]   I mentioned in the intro,
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.340]   can you just spend a few minutes and talk about
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:24.900]   what you can learn from tracking your own health data
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:27.460]   and maybe inspire people to dig deeper?
[01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:28.940]   - Yeah, so levels is,
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:32.420]   we show you how food affects your health using biosensors,
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:34.860]   like a continuous glucose monitor I've went on here.
[01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:36.740]   It's just a patch on your arm.
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:40.300]   It shows you what your glucose levels are in real time
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:43.780]   and allows you to connect the dots on how,
[01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:46.420]   what it is that you're eating is affecting your health.
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:47.260]   For me personally,
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:50.420]   it's really just been more lifestyle focused.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:52.580]   I would say for me,
[01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:56.540]   it has allowed me to see what I'm eating throughout the day
[01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:59.380]   and how that impacts my energy levels throughout the day
[01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:01.460]   of am I feeling tired?
[01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:02.860]   Are my hands shaky?
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:04.220]   Why am I not able to focus?
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:06.340]   Why do I have brain fog?
[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:08.700]   And you often uncover how many of those things
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:10.300]   are just because of what you're eating.
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:12.100]   The simplest example that I can give,
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:14.500]   which was really my first eye-opening moment
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:17.500]   was discovering that my super healthy orange juice
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:20.620]   and oatmeal breakfast was actually the source
[01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:23.140]   of most of my problems throughout the day.
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:24.620]   And I don't even like oatmeal.
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:25.580]   It was just,
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:27.820]   I felt like I had to do it because it was healthy
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:29.980]   and it was actually causing all of these problems.
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:33.460]   So there's nothing like having ground truth data
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:35.380]   when you're trying to make feedback loops
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:37.020]   on understanding how to improve.
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:38.500]   So that's the core of the product.
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.340]   - Yeah, I mean, I have used the product
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:41.500]   on multiple occasions.
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:44.020]   And I think the one thing that was the most interesting
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:46.180]   beyond just seeing how your body reacts
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:47.700]   is doing it with someone else
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:50.380]   and seeing that you're just different.
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:53.380]   And so for me, I don't know why,
[01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:56.300]   but a cinnamon roll doesn't really spike my glucose at all.
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:58.420]   And my wife, it is through the roof.
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:00.580]   You think about a lot of our advice for health
[01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:02.220]   is non-personal.
[01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:04.500]   And so my takeaway from it was
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.220]   I basically watched everything I ate
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:08.460]   and how it affected me in a window of time.
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:10.100]   And my wife did the same thing
[01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:12.660]   and both like interestingly and unfortunately,
[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:14.180]   they were very different.
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:15.700]   Which is disappointing 'cause it means
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:19.460]   if we wanna target similar behaviors in our body,
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:20.660]   we can't eat the same things,
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:22.380]   which makes life more complicated.
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:23.860]   But it just makes you question,
[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:26.940]   oh, if someone says this is a definitive health truth,
[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:30.540]   there are some, but there are also others that aren't.
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:32.980]   - For sure, this is a very new field.
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:35.740]   We've only been able to measure these things in real time
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:37.540]   for single digit years.
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:38.940]   And so a lot of the studies,
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:40.540]   it's still unknown to science
[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.980]   what normal glucose levels even are.
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:44.380]   We're actually running the study now.
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:47.420]   It's the largest study of its kind with about 50,000 people
[01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:51.780]   to just establish what normal glucose even is,
[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:53.380]   which is hard to believe that we don't know that,
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:54.220]   but we don't.
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:57.260]   What's interesting about it is that there are so many things
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:58.940]   that can impact your health
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:01.020]   and how your body responds to this.
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:04.220]   And so much of it is still yet to be discovered.
[01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:08.060]   We know that microbiome plays a huge role in this.
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:10.060]   There's a lot of really cool studies out of Israel,
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:11.700]   I think at Iran Sehgal's lab,
[01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:15.900]   where they knock out the microbiome of mice.
[01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:18.100]   They can effectively replace their microbiome
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:19.220]   with that of another mouse.
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:21.700]   And they're able to change how those mice respond
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:24.540]   to different foods through microbiome transfers.
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:26.540]   Sleep has a huge impact.
[01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:28.300]   Hormones have a massive impact
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:30.740]   on cycles throughout the month.
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:33.180]   How much you exercise has a huge impact.
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:34.260]   If you did a huge workout,
[01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.820]   if your muscles can absorb a lot of glucose.
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:39.900]   There are so many variables that can impact these things.
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:41.180]   Genetics play a factor.
[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:43.740]   So figuring out what is causing all of this,
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:46.580]   I think is gonna be a really interesting area of research
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:48.420]   over the next 10 to 20 years.
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:49.500]   - You started off saying it's about
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:50.500]   how food affects your body,
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:52.180]   but it's also sounds a little meta,
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:53.580]   but it's like how your body can affect
[01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:54.900]   how your food affects your body.
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:55.900]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:59.420]   - And I know like exercising after eating
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:03.140]   can actually change how your body processes food.
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:04.860]   You can see it in the data.
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:08.140]   And so I guess that's a pitch for walking after you eat.
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:09.780]   It doesn't have to be a lot of exercise, right?
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:11.140]   - It's a lot less than people think.
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:13.100]   You know, just like a short walk after eating,
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:14.740]   especially like a high carb meal,
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:17.940]   has a measurable impact on how your body responds.
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:19.260]   - I'll put a link in the show notes
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:20.700]   to where people can go check it out.
[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:22.100]   I remember it used to be invite only,
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.420]   but now I think anyone can sign up.
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:26.420]   You've obviously optimized a lot of your work life,
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:27.820]   the tools you use, everything.
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:29.460]   Anything on the personal side?
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:31.220]   - Since, you know, this is all the hacks,
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:33.700]   I think one hack that is a really useful one
[01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:35.940]   that has helped me a lot,
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:38.580]   just stay present throughout the day,
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.940]   is set alarms for everything.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:44.660]   So the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning,
[01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:48.380]   I look at every meeting that I have throughout the day,
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:51.780]   and I set an alarm for when my next action needs to be.
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:55.340]   So if I have a 9 a.m. meeting, I set an alarm for 9 a.m.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:59.020]   If I have to leave for the airport at 6 p.m.,
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.700]   I set an alarm for 6 p.m.
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:03.300]   And it has allowed me to, for one,
[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:05.980]   not miss meetings and not be late to things.
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:07.660]   There are a lot of people who just rely
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:10.820]   on their Google Calendar alerts,
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:12.700]   and they are so inconsistent,
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.860]   and you end up missing things all the time.
[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:17.100]   But also it allows you to stay present.
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:18.820]   We've all been in meetings where you can see
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:20.580]   the person's constantly checking their watch,
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:22.580]   like what time is it, do I need to leave right now?
[01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:25.380]   If you have an alarm set, it's gonna go off.
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:26.300]   You can just relax.
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:28.740]   You don't have to carry that cognitive burden
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:31.540]   of what if I'm late, how much time has elapsed,
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:33.160]   how much time do I have left?
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:34.780]   It'll tell you, it'll be fine.
[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:37.380]   And so I found that as a tool to just
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:40.260]   be able to maintain presence is a really good one.
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:41.100]   - That is super interesting.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:45.020]   I've relied on the Google Calendar reminders don't work.
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:47.140]   I've actually, the interesting thing about Slack,
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.620]   so a lot of people, it's like Slack is the worst thing ever.
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:51.900]   For all the hacks, our Slack instance
[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:53.500]   has like three people in it.
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:56.220]   So it actually really exists more as a place
[01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:57.680]   to have a bunch of conversations
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:59.460]   and find those conversations.
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:02.060]   And I'm not sure if there's a better tool for that,
[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:04.500]   but it means that Slack isn't that noisy.
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:09.320]   And so the Google Calendar push to Slack as a DM,
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:11.060]   I just have that work,
[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:13.300]   and it sends me a reminder one minute before.
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:15.860]   But I haven't thought about the fact that
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:17.860]   in order to guarantee that gets through,
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:19.420]   you have to let everything else through.
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:22.100]   And the alarm kind of pushes outside of that.
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:25.860]   - The thing about Slack or just communication tools broadly,
[01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:29.460]   the fundamental problem that makes communication hard
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:31.180]   is that the number of people
[01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:34.980]   in a communication cluster scales linearly.
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:38.060]   So you have one person, two people, three people,
[01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:39.100]   it's just linear.
[01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:41.780]   But the number of edges between those nodes
[01:58:41.780 --> 01:58:43.440]   scales polynomially.
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:46.980]   So the difference between 10 people and 100 people
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:50.540]   is not 10 times more, it's like 1000 times more.
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.700]   And so those communication pathways,
[01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:54.740]   you very quickly reach a point
[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:57.580]   where you can no longer keep up with what's going on.
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:00.260]   I've talked to some founders who scaled companies
[01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:02.220]   and they say, you have to treat every doubling
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:03.980]   like it's a different company.
[01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:08.060]   Because primarily this comes from communication pathways,
[01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:11.020]   where it is no longer possible.
[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:14.140]   At a certain scale, you could spend all of your time,
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:17.020]   100% of the day, just keeping up
[01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:18.540]   with what is happening in the company
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:20.020]   and not doing any work.
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:23.340]   And it would be really bad for company productivity,
[01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:24.300]   but you could absolutely do it.
[01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:26.380]   That is how much communication is being generated.
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:29.420]   So you necessarily have to silo information
[01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:31.380]   and you have to figure out where that signal is.
[01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:33.480]   So it gets much, much harder
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:36.040]   once you hit even 20 something people.
[01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:37.120]   - This reminds me,
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:40.240]   and I really hope I'm not misattributing someone else,
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:42.060]   but I believe it was Bill Gurley,
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:44.580]   who is a well-known venture capitalist.
[01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:46.300]   And the idea that he presents
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:47.260]   is when something's not working,
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:49.100]   you just assume that what you're doing now
[01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:50.540]   isn't the right answer.
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:53.140]   And I think it's a principle I've tried to apply
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:54.820]   to a lot of aspects of life.
[01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:57.220]   It's like, oh, communication is kind of broken.
[01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.320]   Let's just assume we're not gonna keep doing it
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:00.160]   how we're doing it.
[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.460]   It's always so easy to just say like,
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:04.080]   how do we tweak the thing we're doing a little bit?
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.500]   But I've now kind of encouraged myself.
[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:09.420]   It's like, oh, if the way we do dinner isn't working,
[02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:11.740]   let's not try to find easier recipes.
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:14.820]   Let's see if we can outsource who picks our recipes
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:15.780]   or something else.
[02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:18.380]   So I've tried to apply this business principle.
[02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:19.660]   And a lot of what I'm,
[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:21.700]   because I don't have a job at a company
[02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:22.720]   with lots of employees,
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:24.460]   every time I hear you talk about these business ideas,
[02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:26.700]   there's a personal application that I'm processing.
[02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:28.220]   That one was one big one for me,
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:29.220]   where it's like, if it's not working,
[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:31.060]   just don't assume you can fix it.
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:32.700]   Maybe assume something else is better.
[02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:33.660]   - For sure.
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:34.780]   - This has been fantastic.
[02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:36.860]   I told you before you started that,
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:38.060]   well, we're not gonna go that long.
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:38.900]   I like to keep it tight
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:40.420]   and there was just too much to cover.
[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:41.980]   So thank you for sticking around
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:43.860]   and going down so many paths.
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:44.680]   - For sure.
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:45.520]   Thanks for having me.
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:47.500]   (upbeat music)
[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:48.340]   - Wow.
[02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:49.160]   If you made it this far,
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:51.500]   then I assume you also enjoyed this conversation
[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:52.700]   as much as I did.
[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:54.060]   Sam is amazing.
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:55.740]   And I am just so excited to be putting
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:57.700]   all of his knowledge to good use.
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:00.060]   Again, if you want a copy of the delegation guide
[02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:01.740]   I put together with the team at Oceans,
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:05.700]   you can find it at allthehacks.com/delegate.
[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:07.740]   And if you wanna check out Oceans
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:10.140]   or look into finding your own assistant with them,

[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:14.380]   Feel free to let them know I sent you
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:16.780]   and I'm pretty sure you'll get hooked up with a deal.
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:18.580]   Okay, this was a long one.
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:19.860]   So that's it for this week.
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:21.080]   I'll see you next week.
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:23.660]   (upbeat music)
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:28.660]   I wanna tell you about another podcast I love
[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:30.980]   that goes deep on all things money.
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:32.640]   That means everything from money hacks
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:34.800]   to wealth building to early retirement.
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:36.980]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:39.860]   and it's much more about building generational wealth
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:42.060]   and spending your money on the things you value
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:44.980]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:46.940]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew,
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:49.160]   who truly believes that everyone in this world
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:51.820]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:54.300]   are what make this show so entertaining.
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:58.140]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022,
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:00.180]   but recently I listened to an episode
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:03.660]   where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:05.540]   And it was so crazy to learn things
[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:08.520]   like 35% of millennials are not participating
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:10.420]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:14.100]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:16.780]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:19.460]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:22.340]   to help you get better with your money and grow your wealth.
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:24.360]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:26.700]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:28.380]   on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,
