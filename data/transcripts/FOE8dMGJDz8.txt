[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   Some things didn't quite make sense.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.300]   Some things seemed like it was just too much.
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.160]   I was asking myself, there's too many initiatives.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.260]   I was trying to get going.
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.740]   And it really stressed me out to the point where I had a hard time sleeping.
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.740]   And yesterday morning.
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.140]   I had an epiphany, and I'm going to put quotation marks
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.800]   around the epiphany here because it is the exact same epiphany
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.900]   I have every single fall.
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.160]   Which is that the planning system that I have been perfecting over a decade,
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.900]   I've been using this for a decade, is what works for me.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.840]   And every time I try to reinvent the wheel.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.540]   Or add new components onto this, I get stressed out.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.500]   And so I said, you know, I need to do forget this like I do every fall.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.840]   Go back to my standard planning system.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   Get all of the pieces of this standard system up and running.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.760]   And I feel much better.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.760]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.140]   Episode two, eleven.

[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.980]   about the theory and practice of the deep life delivered to their inbox each week.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.140]   All right, on to this week's episode.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.980]   My partner, my friend, my friend,
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.220]   my producer, Jesse is back from his sojourns in Scotland.
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.420]   Jesse, when you were gone,
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.520]   I told the listeners that Scotland seemed like a place where I would be really happy.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.080]   I would read books and look at castles and walk to moors and think big thoughts.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.720]   You were just there.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.380]   What would you say, accurate assessment or inaccurate assessment?
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.780]   Very accurate.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.080]   So I was I took some walks around because you were talking about,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.420]   you know, taking some pictures and stuff.
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.280]   And there was a bookstore that you would love.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.180]   There's like caves.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.120]   There's like all these paths along the ocean.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.720]   I mean, I was playing a lot of golf, but I did see a lot of cool stuff.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.820]   I mean, that'd be the the one piece that would not work for me
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.460]   would probably be the playing golf.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.380]   It's hard over there.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.360]   What's it called? The famous course where the old course, the old course.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.680]   Now, is that the you said you told me earlier,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.180]   that's the oldest golf course in the world.
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.180]   Yeah, that's basically I mean, they had golf, but that was where they,
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.860]   you know, first started.
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.160]   I mean, they had golf, but that was where they, you know, first had
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.020]   like a greenskeeper, Tom Morris.
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.720]   And that's where the British Open was played this year. Right.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.420]   I mean, I'm convinced I think you'd back me up here.
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.220]   If I attempted to play a round of golf
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.560]   on that course, they would probably end up just shutting it down permanently.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.360]   Now, I mean, people play over there, but the cool thing is the ground so hard
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.660]   you can actually on some shots, you can put it from like 95 yards out.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.960]   Well, that rolls up. Oh, never mind. I do great.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.760]   All right. So I can putt from 95 yards away.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.560]   Oh, then I'd be fine.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.360]   Depending on the hole.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.900]   Now, I know first swing club out of my hands
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.920]   kills Phil Mickelson, course shut down.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.700]   There's a lot of bunkers that are very, very steep and hard to get out of.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.420]   I remember those.
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.520]   You have to like go backwards.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.100]   Used to watch a little golf. I remember those.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.960]   So we got a good show.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.120]   I want to do a quick plug.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.860]   Just a quick plug.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.760]   Friend of a friend of ours, friend of the show, Scott Young.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.760]   You remember Scott Young, him and I do these online courses together.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.720]   The oldest course we've done together is called Top Performer.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.900]   And we launched this thing in 2014, if you can believe it.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.220]   It was based off of my book.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.320]   So good. They can't ignore you.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.600]   It operationalize those ideas about how to
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.660]   systematically engineer a career that's a real source of passion,
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.620]   real source of meaning, as opposed to just simply saying,
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.100]   what's my dream job, all my passion.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.400]   So it was the course that operationalize those ideas.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.740]   5000 people have taken this course since we launched it.
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.240]   And we've we've updated it last year. We did a big revamp.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.400]   We actually call it Top Performer 2.0.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.940]   Anyways, the week that this podcast episode is released.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.340]   The course is open for new signups.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.600]   So we open it up for signups for one week.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.200]   Usually once, sometimes twice a year.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.500]   So it's open right now.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.300]   If you're interested in Top Performer or finding out more, go to
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.100]   top-performer-course.com. Do I have that right, Jesse?
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.940]   You were working on those. Yeah, I think so.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.900]   Top-performer-course.com to find out more about the
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.340]   this sort of famous course that Scott and I have created.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.600]   It's open again this week only.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.040]   All right. So what type of questions do we have?
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.660]   Look forward to this week.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.700]   We got a good show today.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.460]   We've got some two sets of questions.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.840]   The first is some practical questions on working deeper.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.940]   We've got some questions about task scheduling, open offices,
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.440]   and planning a wedding without going insane.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.240]   I like that one.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.000]   And then we have some philosophical deep life questions
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.360]   about comparing yourself to others and regaining ambition after burning out.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.900]   Sounds good. All right. I'm looking forward to those.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.900]   Before we get to the questions, though, I want to do a deep dive.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.600]   The big question I want to address in today's deep dive is the following.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.640]   How does Cal organize his life?
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.740]   I've talked about this before, but I'm going to get granular today.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.240]   And let me tell you why.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.040]   Because of a recent experience I had just a couple days
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.740]   before recording this episode.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:00.240]   I got very stressed slash anxious to the point where I actually lost a lot of sleep.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.060]   So yesterday I was very tired.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.960]   I was having a hard time sleeping because once my mind got fired up,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.360]   I had a hard time falling asleep.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.460]   Here was the thing that was making me stressed and anxious.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.560]   The fall semester is beginning.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.860]   I usually go a little bit lax. We'll talk about this.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.160]   I go a little bit lax on my systems in the summer.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.560]   I'm a professor slash writer.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.660]   So in the summer, I have very little to do but write.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.260]   I lean into that.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.560]   I take the foot off the gas, put a little bit of my organizational systems.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   And then I have to get things locked back in for the fall because things get more busy.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:40.060]   Well, in the summer, I had accreted all of these ancillary new or miscellaneous disciplines
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.060]   and systems and ideas and projects that I wanted to tackle.
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.160]   And I had these notes about all these different things I was working on spread out over many
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.060]   different digital media and many different notebooks.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.160]   And a couple days ago, I was like, okay, I have to actually get this stuff all wrangled
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.960]   and get my systems all ready for the fall.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.660]   And I couldn't make it work.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.760]   Some of them were redundant with other things.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.460]   Some things didn't quite make sense.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.060]   Some things seemed like it was just too much.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.060]   I was asking myself, there's too many initiatives I was trying to get going.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.360]   And it really stressed me out to the point where I had a hard time sleeping.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.260]   And yesterday morning, I had an epiphany.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:21.560]   And I'm going to put quotation marks around epiphany here because it is the exact same epiphany
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:28.660]   I have every single fall, which is that the planning system that I have been perfecting
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.560]   over a decade, I've been using this for a decade, is what works for me.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   And every time I try to reinvent the wheel, or add new components onto this, I get stressed out.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.760]   And so I said, you know, I need to do forget this, like I do every fall, go back to my
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.660]   standard planning system, get all of the pieces of that standard system up and running and
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.660]   I feel much better.
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.460]   Feel much better.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.260]   This happens to me every summer.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.560]   I think I'm going to come up with some new exciting thing that's going to really jump
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.960]   start some sort of ambition of mine.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.860]   And I always go back to my same old tried and true three-part planning system that has
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.660]   performed everything I have done as a professional in the last decade, which is most of my books,
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.760]   most of my academic work happens because of this planning system.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.660]   So in honor of it and in honor of it being the fall and back to school and work ramping
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:27.860]   up again for a lot of people, I thought I would go through briefly, but clearly through
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:33.460]   the planning system I do to organize the stuff in my life and figure out what to do with
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.560]   my time.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.960]   So I have a document.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.960]   I call us the root document of the core document where I just described the system.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.660]   This I think is an important place to start.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.760]   I call this rooted productivity where you have somewhere a core document from which
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.960]   everything you do actually comes out of it.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.660]   Because to me, it's important that everything is written down, you know where to find it.
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.960]   So I'd like to have one core document that just summarizes, here's the pieces of your
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   system.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.960]   So I just have that somewhere.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.060]   It's not floating in my head.
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:08.160]   So the start, I actually had Jesse load up here, the actual document I use.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.260]   This is the actual document I use that just summarizes the high level of my planning system,
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.560]   the exact wording I use.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.760]   You'll notice as we go through this here, it's not perfectly written.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.160]   It's not perfectly clear.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.460]   It's for me, but I will go through it.
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.060]   All right, so let's start with this.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.460]   All right, for those of you who are watching on the YouTube channel, you can see this for
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.460]   those who are listening.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.760]   I'll narrate it at the top of this document is a title core systems.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   Here's what I say below are summaries of the three main categories that contain the elements
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.360]   my core systems, core documents, productivity and discipline.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.360]   So I've broken this document into those three sections.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   Everything related to my core planning system falls under one of those three categories.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.960]   All right, so we start with category number one, core documents.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.160]   There's two types of core documents I maintain for my system.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:07.560]   One is values, a document that as I say here, describes my roles and values by which I try
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.560]   to live.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.760]   And you'll see like if you're looking this online, it's important.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.960]   The wording is kind of weird because again, it's for me.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.160]   It's not like an essay on publishing.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.760]   It's not polished, doesn't have to be polished.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   I know what it means.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:26.360]   All right, the other type of documents I keep are my career and personal strategic plans.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.060]   This is me reading the words here.
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.560]   I have one plan for each of these two parts of my life that lays out my current thoughts,
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.160]   experimental systems and plans for living true to my values.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.880]   So what I'm trying to say there again, because the writing is not perfect here is like just
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.360]   what's my plan for pursuing those parts of my life in a way that is true to my values.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.760]   I then have a note that says sometimes I'll have extended plans that I'll link to from
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   those documents.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.960]   So if there's a particular big project or initiative I'm working on, I might describe
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.760]   that in its own document and link to it from let's say the professional strategic plan.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.060]   All right, so those are the three documents at the core of my system.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.360]   My values, here are my values, the roles of my life, the values by which I live those
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.960]   roles, and then my career and non-career strategic plans.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:15.760]   I have the subcategory here called maintenance and it talks about how I update these documents.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.560]   And there's three things here and I'll just summarize this at the high level.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.000]   Once a week, I look at my values and create what I call a values plan.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.440]   This is where I emphasize particular values I maybe need to be focusing on or I've fallen
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.440]   off of them.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.320]   Sometimes I'll have some habits in mind to help emphasize a particular value.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.520]   Community connection is important.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.640]   Maybe I need to try for this week calling someone every day, that type of thing.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.120]   So I put this into a kind of a separate, what I call a value plan.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.520]   So it's sort of clarifying and calling out what's important to my values for that week.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.840]   I've noted on here that I also include in my value plan, best practices for mental health.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:58.920]   So what am I doing to help keep my mind sharp and healthy and away from anxiety?
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.480]   I like to think through my practices, have those written down.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.360]   So I try to about once a week to update this values plan.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.760]   All right.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.120]   For my strategic plans, how do I maintain those?
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.200]   Well, once a week, I review them.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.800]   We'll get into that more.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.260]   And then I say here, I can tweak them or change them at any time.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.640]   But I want to make sure at the very least at the beginning of each new semester, I overhaul
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.640]   it.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.560]   So they're written for a semester at a time, but I can tweak them at any time I feel like
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.560]   I should.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.800]   And then finally, I talk about my idea notebook or digital idea storage system.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.920]   So I use Obsidian as well as Moleskine.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.520]   And I keep ideas in there.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.200]   And at the very least, when I do my semester plans or the updates to the strategic plans,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.520]   I'll go through and check those ideas and see if I need to act on any of them.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.720]   All right.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.680]   So that is the core documents and how I maintain them.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.040]   So quick summary of a document of my values.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.320]   I have a career and personal strategic plan.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.960]   I look at the values once a week and pull out this values plan to just to help keep
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.140]   that at the center of my life.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.520]   And I update those strategic plans usually about once a semester.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.080]   All right.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.440]   The next category for my core systems is productivity.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:16.720]   So how do I actually organize my time in a way where I am happy with what I'm producing?
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.740]   I break this down into weekly and daily planning.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:28.520]   So weekly, each week, I build a weekly plan based on a review of my strategic plans, my
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.000]   calendar, my task list, and my value plan.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   So I do a weekly plan.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   You've heard me talk about this.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.320]   I don't get into detail here about what goes into the weekly plan because I play it by
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   ear.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.320]   I'm flexible.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.760]   A very complicated week in the middle of an academic semester might have an intricate
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.240]   Jenga game of how I'm going to make the whole week work.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.800]   A week in July in the middle of the summer might say, "Write!"
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.840]   Exclamation point, exclamation point, and that's it.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.760]   So I don't have a set format for that, but it's how I make sense of what am I working
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   on this week?
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.220]   What do I need to keep in mind?
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.920]   Are there any habits or heuristics I want to have on top of mine?
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.560]   Is there any particular things I need to get done this week?
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.600]   I need to remember to get it done.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   How am I even just attacking this week?
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.160]   All that's in the weekly plan.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.560]   All right.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.360]   Then each day, I review my weekly plan.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.440]   I review my value plan.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.440]   I look at my calendar.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.240]   And if it's a weekday, I make a time block plan.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.320]   So my weekly plan, I check it every day.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.680]   The calendar I check every day.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   Look at my value plan.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.040]   I got to remember what am I focusing on, what's important in my values.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.160]   And then I make my time block plan for the day.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.400]   If it's not a weekday, then I do something looser.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.280]   I don't time block plan weekends, but you might sketch a quick plan.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.680]   "Hey, what am I working on today?
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.980]   What do I need to remember?"
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.480]   That's how my planning works.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.120]   So you see how these things start to connect together.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.680]   The strategic plan influences the weekly plan.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.000]   You look at that weekly plan when you're making your daily plan.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.460]   Your daily plan figures out what you're doing right now.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.560]   So what you're doing right now in this particular system is influenced by your big picture strategic
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.160]   plans, but you don't have to think about your big picture strategic plans right now.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.360]   It comes down through these different levels.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.360]   All right.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.240]   Two other pieces to my productivity system.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.880]   Clear work shutdowns with a shutdown complete ritual.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.880]   So you got to have a clear separation between work and non-work.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.920]   Make a rough but intentional plan for what you want to do with the rest of your day when
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.920]   you shut down.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.920]   That's my shutdown routine.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.720]   And then full capture.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.640]   David Allen right here.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.200]   Full capture of tasks.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.040]   Make sure at the very least at the shutdown each day, you process all the tasks that you've
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.880]   captured into the appropriate systems.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.520]   Again, this is all about for me, stress management.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.680]   I don't want open loops.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.780]   I want to trust if I write something down, it will get seen.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.780]   It will get processed.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.960]   It'll get put on the calendar if it's an appointment or reminder.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.160]   It'll get put on my task list if it's a task.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.740]   It will update my weekly plan if it's a thought about what I need to change for my plan.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.680]   And there it will be seen the next day.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.600]   It'll be seen in when I look at my weekly plan.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.240]   It'll get reflected in my time block plan.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.440]   It'll be seen when I look at the calendar to make the plan on the relevant day.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.920]   The whole game here is trusting.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.440]   I don't have to keep track of things in my mind.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.060]   I can have this ambitious schema for how I'm trying to advance these big picture goals
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.000]   that have all these moving parts that are rapidly changing in the moment.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I don't want to worry about any of it except for what I'm doing in the moment.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.600]   And if it's in the evening, then I should just be worried about whatever relaxing thing
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.920]   that I'm trying to do.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.540]   All right, the third category here is discipline.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:34.400]   So I maintained my strategic plans and evolving list of core disciplines.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.460]   This might be things about like exercise.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.520]   It might be things about the number of deep work hours you're going to do each day.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.680]   It might be something if you're in sales about the number of calls you make every day, whatever.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.480]   But the point is, they're disciplines that I try to strictly follow to lay a foundation
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.480]   for a deep life.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.880]   So I think it's important to have hard disciplines.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.140]   I do this, I do that, and I do this other thing.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.520]   And I always do those things.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:04.740]   These hard boundaries that you follow to help establish a foundation of a deeper life.
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.760]   And so that's the third part of my system is having this evolving list of disciplines.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.040]   I talk about here is I often track these with metrics.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.080]   Sometimes I don't.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:20.600]   So typically, if it's during an academic semester, I'll have a metric code for each of my disciplines
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.560]   where I can keep track of my time block planner and the metric planning space.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.560]   Did I do this today?
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.560]   Did I do this today?
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.760]   I like to actually see it.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.240]   Other times I take a break from it, like in the summer, for example, or over a break,
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.540]   there are periods I'll take a break for it.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.800]   So that is there, but I'm typically collecting these metrics.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   That's it.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   That's the system.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.560]   That system can support massively complicated ambitions.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:51.120]   That system can support an incredibly complicated, fast moving professional environment where
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.040]   it's very difficult to keep track of all the different things that have to fit together.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.040]   This system will support that.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:03.640]   This system will support a life outside of work that you can be present and intentional
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.680]   and interesting and pursue things that are interesting to you and develop yourself and
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.720]   develop your mind, develop your relationships, not get lost in work and not get completely
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.040]   overwhelmed with anxiety and stress.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.440]   This system will support your pursuit of living truer to your values, living a good life,
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.800]   trying to actually practice and implement the things that make a good life good.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.320]   All of these things are important.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:30.000]   This simple system that I described in these three categories of notes in this one document
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.640]   handles everything.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.040]   And it has in my life for over a decade.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.360]   So all this extra type of stuff I was trying to do in the last few weeks, I realized that
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.120]   all fits in here.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.680]   I know this, I trust this.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.680]   It's not perfect.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.100]   Some of this stuff is redundant.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.320]   Not all of it makes perfect sense.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.960]   Why is the value plan a separate thing?
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.840]   Shouldn't that be part of the weekly planning?
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.400]   There's all these little legacy incongruities.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.120]   Did I say that right, Jesse?
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.120]   Incongruities.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.120]   Yeah, you said it right.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120]   Incongruities.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.280]   Let me write that down in my disciplines.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.620]   Say words correctly.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.120]   But it all can be captured here.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.960]   And it's a system that can flex.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.000]   When you're doing complicated things, these documents can get big.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.240]   Your strategic plans get big.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.400]   Your task lists get really big.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.060]   Your calendar is full.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.040]   You have extended plans that you're linking to from your strategic plans.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.600]   Your weekly plans look like epic essays.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.160]   And other periods, you're burnt out.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.820]   You're going through a hard time.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.120]   The system can contract.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.360]   Really just down to the basics.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.360]   Here's my values.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.520]   I've got to get these core things done in my life.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.680]   A lot of trying to get out of the despair, get out of the depths.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.040]   The system contracts to that as well.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.920]   So it's really a flexible system.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.880]   So this is my public apology to my system.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.640]   Sorry for thinking I could do a little better.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.400]   You've always been what I need in my life.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.240]   This then is my call to you out there in my audience.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.640]   If you don't already have a pretty effective system that captures all of the parts of your
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.480]   life, the things that matter to you, professional, non-professional, and goes from, captures
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.960]   those for everything from those big thoughts all the way down to what you're doing today,
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   what you're doing tomorrow.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.800]   If you don't have a system like that, try this one.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.200]   Try this one for a month.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.640]   I don't know why it works so well, but it does.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.000]   These parts in the way they mingle and the daily, weekly, and the flexibility, it's a
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.320]   decade's worth of experimentation.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.880]   It does work.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.200]   Give it a try.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.040]   At first it feels like a lot of moving pieces.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.360]   You get in the rhythm and it actually makes you feel freer and actually makes you feel
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   more relaxed.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   Hey, trust it.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.360]   The system's got me.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.000]   And in the end it does produce stuff that matters.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.840]   So that's how I do it.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.840]   I don't know.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.400]   You've heard me talk about the system before.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.080]   It's not too complicated.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.120]   I'm used to it because I've done it for a decade.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.080]   It's like muscle memory for me, but I don't know.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.480]   When I read it from scratch, I'm like, do these pieces click?
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.360]   I think for people who hear it for the first couple of times, they just got to watch this
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.840]   video and then hear you say it a couple of times because it does make a lot of sense
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.840]   after.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.160]   And I've been doing it for a couple of years since you started your podcast.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.320]   Yeah, it's worked for you, right?
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.480]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:16.400]   And then in terms of the discipline stuff, I was thinking about your buddy, Ryan, is
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.640]   writing a new book called Discipline.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.520]   Have you already read it?
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.520]   Not yet.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520]   Discipline is something.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.520]   I forgot the word.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   Yeah, because Ryan's doing a book on each of the four cardinal virtues.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   Yeah, he has a whole book coming out.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.520]   I'm excited for it.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.520]   I don't know if he gave you like an advanced copy or something.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.520]   He will.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.520]   I mean, we share an editor.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.520]   We tend to see each other's work.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.880]   I talk to him quite a bit.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.360]   That was the last thing, by the way, that was added to my, if you look at a decade,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.800]   the last thing that was added to my system was being explicit about what are the disciplines?
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.680]   What are the, I do these seven things and just being clear about that.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.320]   I was kind of informally doing things like exercise or whatever.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.800]   But for me, if it's not written down, other people don't have this issue, but for me,
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.640]   if it's not written down, I don't fully trust it.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.360]   And then I get anxious.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:10.120]   So I have to have it written down and it all has to connect back.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.120]   It all has to connect back to this root document.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.360]   So there we go.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:20.480]   I was listening to an interview with Sisson and Rogan.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.840]   And he, it was actually from 2021.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.520]   I listened to that one.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.520]   I just listened to it yesterday.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.440]   I just stumbled across it, but he was talking about, they were talking about discipline
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:37.000]   and Rogan was talking about his 15, like his 25 minute session in the sauna and then 15
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.560]   minutes, like the last 10 minutes, he's got this breathing routine.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.720]   If he thinks about anything else, he adds like an extra breath.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:50.120]   But if you ever heard Joe Rogan talk to Laird Hamilton, I don't know, he was on the show
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.520]   a couple of years ago.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.000]   You know, Laird Hamilton, Laird Hamilton fan and Rogan, I guess was talking about his,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.160]   like I do this like hardcore sauna thing.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.760]   And Laird was like, hold my beer.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.760]   Laird is like insane.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.920]   That guy is so interesting.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.920]   He swims with like dumbbells.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.920]   He swims with dumbbells.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.400]   He has a giant sauna.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:12.440]   And so Rogan's like, man, I stay in my sauna for like 15 minutes, 25 minutes.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.040]   Laird Hamilton brings an assault bike into the sauna, which for people who don't know
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.840]   is like the hardest single piece of exercise equipment.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.640]   It's like you do your arms and your legs and resistance and you're like mountain climbing.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.640]   I don't know.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.640]   It's impossible.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.640]   Right.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.400]   It's like one of the hardest single exercise you can do.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:34.600]   He brings one of those into a giant barrel sauna and does it and then gets into an ice
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.360]   bath.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.080]   So you know, his discipline document is more impressive than mine.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.080]   All right.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.700]   Well, I want to get to these questions, but first let's quickly mention one of the sponsors
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.000]   that makes the deep questions podcast possible.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.940]   And that is our good friends at Grammarly.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:01.800]   It's a point I make often communicating clearly is like a superpower in the knowledge economy
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:07.280]   because of all the emails and the text messages and the chats and the proposals and the documents.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.760]   If you come across really clear and confident in your writing, people will say this person
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.640]   knows what they're doing.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.480]   You'll get more responsibilities, you'll get more flexibility, you will advance faster.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.440]   The problem is writing clearly is hard.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.720]   This is where Grammarly can enter the scene.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.380]   It is free to download and works where you do.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:33.440]   It has multiple features that will impress you.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.460]   We've come a long way since the old days of simply correcting grammar mistakes.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.600]   So if you're using the free version of Grammarly, you're going to get comprehensive spelling,
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.880]   grammar and punctuation suggestions.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.520]   Okay, that's the that's the foundation you expect for grammar checkers.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.360]   Grammarly is best in the business for that.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.040]   If you go to Grammarly premium, which is what I recommend, you will then get clarity focused
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:00.220]   sentence rewrites will actually say, take the sentence, rewrite it this way.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.080]   People are going to understand you better.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.540]   This is like all I do, by the way, when I'm working with my editors at magazines with
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.680]   my book editor, so much of this work is be clear.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   How do we fix this?
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.820]   How do we make this more direct?
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.800]   If you don't have a Penguin book editor, New Yorker editor looking over your shoulder,
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.600]   Grammarly can actually help you do this with software.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.400]   It also has a tone detector.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.680]   It'll tell you this is the tone that your email has.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.680]   We're bad.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.440]   I talked about this in my most recent book.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.000]   We're bad at predicting how people will emotionally receive our written text.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.480]   Grammarly can help you.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.520]   So get more time in your day with confidence and more confidence in your work with Grammarly.

[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.020]   my listener.

[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:59.740]   All right.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:07.400]   I also want to talk briefly about Wren, W-R-E-N, which is a startup that's making it easy for
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.420]   everyone to make a meaningful difference in the climate crisis.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.240]   So right now, here's what they're offering is monthly subscriptions where you calculate
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:22.640]   your carbon footprint, then offset it by supporting awesome climate projects that plant trees,
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:28.140]   protect rainforests and remove CO2 from the sky.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.360]   Their goal is to unlock the collective action in millions of individuals to drive the systemic
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.400]   change we need to end the climate crisis.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.800]   Jesse, you're not helping.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:40.880]   I heard, and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, that for your trip to Scotland, you
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:47.360]   took your truck, which if I have this right, is from 1948, one of the most pollution producing
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.760]   trucks in existence.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:54.600]   You chartered a private jet to fly your truck to Scotland so that you could drive that truck
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.840]   in Scotland because you felt a little bit more comfortable with it.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.340]   Do I have, I think that's more or less right.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.340]   That's right.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.780]   But it was awkward because everybody else drives on the, the right side.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.780]   Which you refuse to do.
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.780]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.780]   God bless America.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:12.900]   Smoke coming out of it, tarnishing the old course in St. Andrews with soot, Jamie blasting
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.160]   country music out of his pickup truck that he had shipped over there.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.680]   So he went on Wren.co, he went on Wren the other day, Wren.co and calculate his carbon
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.880]   footprint and in the site, it broke temporarily, but it's up now.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:31.080]   But anyways, we have to compensate for the damage being caused by Jesse.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.960]   And this is where Wren can help.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.960]   I mean, it's a cool idea.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.540]   Like how much do I produce?
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.600]   Let me literally offset exactly that.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.440]   They do the hard work of figuring out how to do those offsets.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:45.840]   Signing up for Wren is an easy way to do something meaningful about the climate crisis.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.780]   So it's going to take all of us to end the climate crisis.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.140]   Do your part today by signing up for Wren.
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:28:00.400]   Go to Wren.co/deep, sign up and they will plant 10 extra trees in your name.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.560]   That's Wren.co/deep.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.560]   Start making a difference.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.560]   All right.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.880]   Enough of that.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   Let us get to some questions.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.560]   Again, if you're new to the show, this is where I take questions from you, the listeners,
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:20.000]   about how to put my ideas into action in the specific circumstances of your life.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.720]   Go to calnewport.com/podcast to figure out how to submit your own questions for future
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   episodes of the show.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.460]   All right, Jesse, what do we have for our very first question this week?
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.680]   The first question we have is from Helen and she has a question on how do I improve on
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.080]   estimating the time required for a task?
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   It's a good question, especially if you're a time block planner, you have to actually
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:49.020]   figure out in advance how much time to put aside for a particular task that you're scheduling.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:54.400]   The default answer here is most people are very bad at this and you should take whatever
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:59.760]   estimate you are sure is right and double it.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.320]   That's what I recommend unless you've been doing this for a long time and have been pretty
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   accurate.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.320]   Most people are off by a factor of two.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:14.200]   If we're going to be honest, you should probably also in most days have a open buffer period.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:18.780]   So a period of time that's not assigned to any particular work, it's just there under
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:24.760]   the assumption that stuff's going to run long and you want a little bit of breathing room.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.280]   So you should have at least one buffer period.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.760]   So if you're doubling your time estimates and put a buffer period, you'll be okay.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.840]   You'll probably still have to drop one thing off your schedule each day.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.280]   It's just basically impossible.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:41.280]   It is so difficult to figure out how long things take, but this is definitely our bias.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.880]   We want our plan to reflect a world in which everything happens in the best possible way
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.440]   because we feel good about it in the moment.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.440]   It never goes that way.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.160]   So double your estimate, put in buffers and psychologically be okay with still having
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.240]   to take things off your plate.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.720]   I talk about that in the Time Block Planner.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.960]   I sell timeblockplanner.com.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.440]   There's a whole chapter on productivity in the planner.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.200]   Just for whatever, there's a long essay on productivity.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.200]   I talk about estimates in that.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.200]   So there you go.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   There's a little Easter egg in that planner.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.000]   And then the thing that I'll finish that is put off to the next day based on the weekly
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   plan, right?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.240]   So even when you do your schedule shutdown routines, if you're using my core planning
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.200]   system, you're processing your capture.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.520]   As part of processing that capture, you're dealing with the stuff on your plan you didn't
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   get to.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.520]   Yeah, you figured out.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.520]   So maybe it goes on your calendar for another day.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.760]   Maybe it goes into your weekly plan.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.300]   You update your weekly plan.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.880]   Maybe you bounce it back to your task list and say, "I'll just have to deal with that
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.880]   later."
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.400]   What doesn't happen is it doesn't just go away.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.840]   It doesn't just disappear.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.440]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.440]   All right.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.520]   The next question we have from Kimberly.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:49.600]   Kimberly's asking, "How does Cal feel about open office spaces?"
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.400]   And she goes on to elaborate a little bit more.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.080]   Her office is planning to change to a hybrid and they can either work from home or come
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.680]   into the office.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.340]   The work environment in the open place is going to have some shared tables and she wants
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.840]   your thoughts on that.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:08.160]   Well, I mean, as you can imagine, Kimberly, I'm a big fan of open offices.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.400]   I think it's great because you know what?
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:17.960]   How are we going to have serendipity if we don't all sit in the same cacophonous hangar
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.200]   at shared tables to work?
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.600]   And in fact, what I think we should really do is just have giant shared couches we all
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.760]   lounge on, all aimed at a huge flat screen TV in which we're projecting Slack channels
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.360]   on which we're all participating.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.640]   And we can just have tubes coming from the ceiling that delivers off soylent so we can
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.960]   just get nutrition as we Slack jaw stare at all the rapid communication all next to each
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.040]   other.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.840]   That is a sarcasm, Kimberly.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.960]   No, I'm not a big fan of open offices.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.520]   I've written a lot about them.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:56.240]   My argument in a nutshell is that open offices hurt 90% of what we think about when we think
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:03.360]   about knowledge, work, productivity, the actual production of the things that your organization
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:09.080]   produces to make money or to satisfy its funders, the actual work that your company or organization
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.080]   needs to do to exist.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.560]   Open offices for the most part hurts that actual execution.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:21.200]   What they're supposed to be good for is that extra 10% of serendipity connection inside
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.720]   Oh, I run into someone, we have a chat, we figure out something new.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.320]   That's usually one of the big reasons people use to justify open offices.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.680]   I think that's a very minor piece of productivity.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.280]   The big piece is actually doing the work and it act actively hurts it.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.720]   There's data to support this.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.680]   There's a really good study that was published a few years back in the proceedings of the
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:49.440]   Royal Society, really good sociometer study where they took an office that was about to
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.960]   switch to an open format, but had not yet.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.080]   So they could do a B testing.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.880]   So right before this particular company switched to an open office, they put these meters for
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.840]   people to wear around their necks that could measure face-to-face interaction.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.360]   Oh, I am talking to Jesse and it could log that.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.160]   And then they also had logs of what was going on in everyone's computer.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.960]   Then the exact same team working on the exact same projects, just a few days later, switched
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.600]   to an open office and they gathered data in the open office as well.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.680]   A B comparison, good, fair comparison.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.120]   The only variable that changed was the office.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:27.200]   What they found is when they went to the open office, face-to-face interaction, the entire
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:34.480]   justification of open offices, serendipitous encounters went down.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.080]   Email and instant messaging went up.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:44.480]   And the metrics they were using as a proxy for production or productivity also went down.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.720]   So it made people less productive.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.000]   And it actually had the opposite effect on the proximal outcomes that people cared about.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.940]   The explanation was actually real simple.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.580]   People talk to each other less because in an open office, it bothers more people.
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:03.360]   So actually, when they were in the old setup, and I had a quick question for you, I might
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.760]   go to your office and talk to you into that office because we're not bothering other people
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.760]   in the open office.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.360]   I'm actually going to be more reticent to do that because there's 50 other people at
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   our stupid share table.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.080]   And I don't want to hear anything we're talking about.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.720]   So people actually had less interaction.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.800]   So it's really a bad idea.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.420]   It doesn't make people more productive.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.040]   It doesn't lead to more face-to-face interaction.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.400]   It doesn't lead to more serendipity.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.560]   So why do we have these things?
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.640]   We have them because of Silicon Valley.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.000]   That is where these ideas were incubated and spread.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.840]   And I will say this, the Silicon Valley companies that really leaned into open offices were
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:42.420]   not being stupid, but they also weren't trying to make their employees more productive.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:48.480]   My argument has always been that the original innovation of open offices was to signal to
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:54.200]   potential hires and potential investors that your company was disruptive, that your company
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.560]   was not like normal companies.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.920]   If you're a Silicon Valley startup, that's critical because getting those hires or getting
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.840]   that investment is what matters.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.800]   It is one of the most important things.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.000]   So if signaling, look, we're disruptive, we have an open office and we have ping pong
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.240]   tables and we have these nap pods, you're more likely to get that MIT grad.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:21.000]   They're like, "Yeah, that sounds more interesting than going to work for Procter and Gamble."
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.760]   You're more likely to get that seed investment from Andreessen Horowitz.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.560]   It's like, "Yeah, these people are up to something new.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.960]   We could imagine big innovation coming out of there."
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.440]   So they were invented for a very rational reason, but it was a signaling purpose.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:37.160]   Then it spread to other companies where that signaling value goes down.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.800]   Procter and Gamble can switch to open offices.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   They're not tricking anybody.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.040]   They're not tricking anybody.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.680]   They're not going to see that as an innovative company.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.840]   So when it spread out of Silicon Valley and the signaling value went away, then it became
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.080]   basically just a net negative.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.880]   So I think that it's a bit of an accident of management theory that these things actually
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.880]   spread.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.880]   There's a good reason for them.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.880]   They're cheaper.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.160]   That's why I think Kimberly, if that was her name, that's why Kimberly might be seeing
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:08.320]   her company doing it, is if you're significantly consolidating space because most employees
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:14.480]   are remote at most times and the overhead of keeping an office for every possible employee
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.960]   is too high, then that might make sense.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.320]   If it's 20% of the time people are here, let's just hot swap some desks.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.760]   So there is a money saving argument, but for the most part, they don't work.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.760]   They don't make you more productive.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.440]   They don't generate more ideas.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.720]   I don't like them.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.000]   You know, it's Apple.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.640]   Jesse is mentioning this.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.400]   They're having a big fight with their employees.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400]   I just saw that.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.860]   And yeah, I'm doing a thing, writing about it.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.560]   So I've been kind of going deep on it, but it's one of the things the employees argued
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.560]   about.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.560]   They want remote work to stay.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.400]   And Tim Cook is like, we spent $2 billion on this headquarters.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.920]   Like we want you to come in.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.040]   One of the big things they argued is it's too full of open offices.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.040]   We can't work.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:02.680]   I was not annoyed, a little bit annoyed though, that the quote was from the big official letter
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.720]   that the Apple group wrote.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.840]   That was like, this is why we don't want to go back to remote work.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   They wrote this in the spring.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.960]   It was a group called Apple Together.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.960]   And in their letter, they said, these open offices make it difficult for us to do deep
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.960]   thought.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.600]   Like, no, deep work.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.060]   This is what you're thinking about.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.060]   This could have been free publicity.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.060]   It's the words you're thinking about.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.060]   It's not deep thought.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.060]   Deep thoughts is jack handy.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.700]   That's not what you're talking about.
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.700]   So it's close.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:28.700]   They were so close.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.220]   I know they're thinking about deep work, but they got, it's like when people will also
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.220]   say deep focus.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.220]   It's like, no, it's not deep focus.
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.660]   It's not deep focus.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.020]   That's not the right way to think about it.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.340]   Focus is, it's like an, it's an adjective.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:46.780]   Something can be focused, but work is the actual thing that you're trying to do.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.780]   It's not deep focus.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.780]   It's deep work.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:53.420]   So I was close to getting free publicity in that, in that letter.
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.420]   One word away.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.820]   Cook only wants them to come back like twice a week though.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.820]   Right?
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:37:59.820]   It was, I think it's three times.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.020]   Well, it's shifting so much.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.420]   The only thing I don't buy, okay.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.420]   I don't want to get into too much detail because I'm writing about it, but this is not from
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.020]   that.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:15.780]   The one side I noticed is, so the, they've been doing this since September of 2021.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.180]   They keep saying, okay, here's when we're doing it.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.180]   And they postpone.
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.180]   They're like, here's when we're doing it.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.180]   I think they've done it six times.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.180]   They postponed it.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.860]   The big one where he's like, this is it, was in April of this year was when Tim Cook was
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.740]   like, no, no, we call it, we're going to give it a fancy name that no one cared about.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.140]   We call it the hybrid work pilot.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.980]   It was just, you come in three days a week.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.500]   And this is when the letter was written.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.860]   Also like a key employee quit.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.180]   It was like, I'm going to go to Google.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.420]   They'll let me do whatever I want.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.420]   So then they were like, okay, nevermind.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.420]   We take it back.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.420]   Right.
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.740]   So they took it back in April.
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.260]   And now a couple of weeks ago, he was like, forget that we are going to come back.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.960]   But in back in April, after all that protest, he's like, ah, we take it back.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.640]   The reason he cited was coronavirus.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:01.300]   I don't buy that in April, 2022, that that's why like, oh, it's not at all about this,
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.640]   like pretty worrying labor dispute we're having with our employees.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.820]   We're worried about coronavirus.
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:13.020]   I don't see how they make that argument when every single one of their kids is in school
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.020]   all day long.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.020]   I looked it up.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.700]   San Francisco County does not even require masks for their students in schools where
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.940]   the I looked this up from the Labor Bureau.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.660]   Their metrics from May.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:27.140]   It's been a factor of four drop of knowledge workers reporting that they're working from
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.140]   home.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.460]   Their company has been working from home due to coronavirus.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.900]   Like basically no one's doing that anymore.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.340]   It just seems really hard to make the argument in April of 2022.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.860]   This somehow is going to be a problem.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:42.580]   It's like some Apple employees are in the office.
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.940]   The last people not in an office.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.060]   So anyways, there's just a little aside like clearly you're delaying it because this is
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.220]   like a major complicated labor dispute and you don't know what to do.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:55.660]   Oh, and by the way, the letter from Apple together, no mention of coronavirus.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.380]   The guy quitting the head of that machine learning head, no mention of coronavirus.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.460]   Like it was the cop out dodge.
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.460]   Sure.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.220]   Tim Cook not wanting to get address the deeper unrest of his employees.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:12.980]   He's like, no, we just, you know, Omicron.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.580]   That's why we're.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.180]   You would think a lot of the technicians and stuff would have to go on because they have
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:20.180]   like labs and stuff that they're like testing and prototyping stuff, right?
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.180]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.180]   But I mean, a lot of it's digital.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.740]   If you think about Apple, a lot of that's programming.
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.420]   Even like the interfaces of like the hardware and stuff.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.420]   They're probably in.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.420]   Yeah, probably.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.580]   But you know, one of those labs, not Johnny Ives, but there was a, you know, and I don't
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:38.940]   know which group this was, but there's a group that was run by a super hotshot and I thought
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:39.940]   it was a design group.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.540]   It might not be, but when they were opening that new office, uh, Cupertino's, if you've
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:49.660]   seen it like a giant, yeah, it's mainly open from what I understand.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:52.860]   He just said, no, he's like, my group's not going there.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.340]   We're not going to work in that open environment.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.340]   We don't want to be surrounded by thousands of people.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:02.460]   We know how to get work done and we need to, we need to be together and we need to be,
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.660]   um, have offices, be able to work and have a hub and spoke configuration.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.620]   Like I talk about in my book, deep work.
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.620]   And he just said no.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.620]   And he was such a big shot.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.980]   They're like, okay, well he doesn't have to do it.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.980]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.980]   So that's interesting.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.700]   They probably have a pretty sweet gym there.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.460]   I've lived a lot of gyms.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.460]   I got some rovers there.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:24.340]   And when you think of like Silicon Valley tech employees, don't think about, I was about
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.580]   to say you don't think about people in great shape, but then Bezos.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.580]   He's a beast.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.580]   I mean, that's changing.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.580]   All right.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.580]   Uh, let's see here.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:34.580]   What do we got next?
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.580]   Jesse.
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:41.580]   Uh, next question we got from Mika and he asked, does listening to a podcast count as
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.580]   reading?
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.340]   Uh, no, I don't count it the same.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:52.740]   I think these are two different classes of intellectual substance that you're ingesting.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.960]   Here's the quick way I discern between the two.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:42:01.360]   So when you're, when you're reading the book, you're ingesting a, a fully formed, carefully
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.640]   thought through thought structure.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.040]   And we're talking nonfiction here, but you have a writer who has really thought something
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.900]   through it might be their, their lifelong expertise or something they researched deeply.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.880]   They spent a long time trying to organize these thoughts into a structure that is internally
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.260]   coherent and makes sense and has been validated.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.840]   So when you're reading a good nonfiction book, you can basically take this well-crafted thought
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.360]   structure and just graft it onto your cognitive framework.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:31.160]   Oh, now I understand, you know, uh, the influence of cryptocurrency on whatever.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.600]   Currency markets, plug that in podcast.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.720]   It's more conversational.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:42.760]   I think of podcast as a source of the type of material with which you could build one
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.640]   of these structured thoughts, right?
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.920]   Oh, I might learn a bunch of interesting stuff from a podcast, but there's still a lot of
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.680]   work to be done probably to take the various things I heard in this interview or got out
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.080]   of this conversation and mix it with things I've learned elsewhere and build it together
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.440]   into a coherent thought to build it together into something I could write 10,000 words
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.440]   on or write a book about.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:06.280]   So you're, you're getting raw thought stuff on podcasts then in books.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.660]   That's why I think about it differently.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.200]   It's also why it's less cognitively demanding to listen to a podcast.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.920]   You can, you can zone in and out, be in conversational mode.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.640]   And when you hear something interesting, then pay attention to sort of collect that for
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.640]   use later.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.880]   So I see it as being different things.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.640]   The exception of course is this podcast.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.660]   Nothing about this is raw.
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:29.240]   This is all finely honed intellectual material.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:35.280]   My, my proposal, I think this is reasonable, is that listening to this podcast should legally
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:40.800]   be equivalent to being awarded a doctorate from an accredited university.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.040]   And that's just a, it's just one man's opinion.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.040]   What's your view on podcasts versus music?
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.200]   Different things like music's an aesthetic experience.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.280]   So you know, especially if you have music appreciation, I just either it's like a, an
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.280]   appreciation experience.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:02.000]   Like I just really enjoy this musician or it's a kind of like a neurotropic experience.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.640]   I'm working out and I want to whatever, just get fired up or it's a, just want to get lost
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.920]   or listen to something funny, like mood alteration.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.920]   So it's like an aesthetic experience, mood alteration.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.520]   I think that's different than information ingestion.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.520]   So I count them differently.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.520]   All right.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.920]   What do we got next?
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.320]   All right.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.280]   Next question is from Nathaniel.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:27.660]   He asks, how do I plan a wedding without drowning in minutia?
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.040]   He goes on to explain that he's getting married in a month.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:36.520]   Partner's amazing, but he's getting overloaded with minor details.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:40.640]   All right.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.640]   Wedding planning.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   I was very young when I got married.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:46.560]   I don't remember a lot of this and our wedding was informal.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.440]   I think I, based on some of the weddings I've been to recently, I now understand it as a
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:55.520]   more complicated procedure than it once was.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.460]   So here's the, I would say the big point I would deliver here, Nathaniel, is that these
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:05.060]   vendors work for you, you're paying them.
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:10.000]   So you have a lot of flexibility in setting the standards by which your interactions are
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.300]   going to happen.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:16.200]   Most vendors are not productivity gurus, right?
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.240]   So left to their default, it's going to be like, I don't know, I'm just going to shoot
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.480]   you off a text message or an email.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.480]   I have a bunch of clients.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.560]   I'm just like, all day long.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.400]   And you could get sucked into that and then you're all day long.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.760]   It'd be the technical description of what it's like to fall into the hyperactive hype
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.760]   mind.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.080]   I say you should figure out, here's how I want to work with you.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.000]   Here's how I want to communicate, where we want to store information, how we deal with
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.820]   various types of interactions that will happen common in our relationship.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:41.820]   Here's how it's going to work.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.200]   Okay, I'm paying you.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.400]   So you kind of have to say yes.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   And you can engineer these interactions to be much less ad hoc, much less haphazard and
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.960]   require much less on demand attention.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:01.280]   So for example, you might use dedicated email addresses, a dedicated address for the planning
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.720]   itself or even multiple dedicated addresses for different aspects of the planning.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.980]   Wedding planning office hours could be a critical idea.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.740]   I have 30 minutes put aside every day.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.240]   Maybe it's during your drive home.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.240]   Right?
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.800]   I don't know when it is.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.440]   This is the time that you just keep every time one of these vendors is like, okay, we're
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.440]   not sure about like the lilies.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.440]   We have a different type of purple.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.880]   We're not sure what's going to work or we need your approval and this or that.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:34.760]   You always just say until they have it seared into their brain, call me during four to four
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   thirty.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   You can always call me.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.560]   Don't even bother emailing me about just call me then.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.920]   I'm always here.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   And you know what?
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.060]   They will love that.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.020]   Vendors love just like any type of client.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.980]   They really do love the clarity.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.140]   I know exactly how to get an answer.
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.820]   I don't have to send something out there and try to remember it.
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.540]   And is it going to be like all my other jerk clients and forget to respond to this?
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.140]   I can always just call Nathaniel.
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.660]   I always call him at four.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.980]   He's always there.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.540]   There's 50 or 60 percent of your communication.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.220]   Agree on processes in advance.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.700]   If like this is what we're going to do.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.380]   Okay, we're picking the flowers.
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.940]   Let's talk this through in our initial meeting.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.000]   Like what's going to happen here?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   This will happen.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   We'll have to see these samples.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   We'll have to give you some approval.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.120]   You're going to build a sample thing.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.960]   You'll have these questions.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.480]   Figure out the whole process in advance and sit there and write it down.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.980]   Here's how we're going to do it.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.000]   By this date, you'll put this here.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.440]   We have a conversation for a half hour here.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.880]   We'll deal with all of these things.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.240]   Put the photos up here.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.000]   I will figure out the whole process.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.160]   It all goes onto your calendar.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   It's all written down.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.160]   They see it.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.160]   You see it.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:39.200]   Every ounce of planning energy has to be further invested in this particular interaction.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.500]   You have it all figured out.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.980]   Again, vendors like clients in general want clarity more than they want like, oh, I can
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.300]   just reach you at any point.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.460]   Reaching you at any point is not the big deal.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.500]   The big deal is getting you to actually do stuff and not them have to not worry about
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.500]   it.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.500]   Clarity trumps accessibility.
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:48:02.040]   Finally, wedding planning is actually a good situation in which hiring a part time assistant
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.360]   is worth it.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.540]   It's a type of work where a part time assistant is actually quite useful.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.080]   It's like very specific.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:14.980]   It doesn't require domain knowledge about like what you do for a living.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:20.980]   You're spending, and this is looking at the official estimate of the average wedding budget
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:25.700]   of 2022, you're spending quote, all of your money anyways.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:31.620]   So the cost of a few hundred dollars a month for the part time assistant is nothing.
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.660]   And it could make a really big difference.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.420]   A for a good one.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.040]   It's worth it.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.420]   And have them be the point of contact, like three or four of these vendors, you talk to
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.420]   them.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.420]   So if you can't get your vendors to call you at the same time, you have a half hour conversation
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.420]   every other day with your assistant.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.100]   We're like, here's all the things going on.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:52.640]   You're like, great, here's my answer to this, my answer to that for this one, get me a sample
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.940]   for this one, get on my calendar, you know, a meeting day.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:01.580]   And the very last suggestion I would have Nathaniel is have a certain half day where
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:05.480]   this is when you do the meetings that have to happen.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:10.440]   And you just build your work schedule around leaving whatever Friday, noon to four clear.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.400]   So it's really easy when people like, all right, well, we got a call, we got to talk
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   about this.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:19.820]   He's like, yeah, just grab a time, use a calendar, have this time open in the same same period.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:25.620]   Now the reason why I'm going into sub steps about wedding planning, and I need to qualify
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.580]   this so it doesn't get back to my wife.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.700]   And she's like, wait a second, what are you up to?
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.860]   Why are you thinking so much about wedding planning?
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:37.820]   The reason why I'm getting into this is because what I just went through there applies to
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:42.100]   many different professional relationships you might have in your life.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:48.220]   Big conferences, you're trying to organize a new client that you're trying to get on
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.300]   board a new service, you're offering whatever.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:56.700]   There's lots of professional situations in which a lot of haphazard ad hoc interactions
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.080]   going to have to happen to make it pull off.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:04.340]   Do not in those situations just default to let's just rock and roll, man.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:05.340]   Here's my text message.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:08.720]   I have WhatsApp going, I'll check email all the time.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.780]   And let's just don't do that.
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.700]   Take the time up front to be like, how are we going to structure these interactions and
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.120]   all the different types of things I just talked about.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:24.780]   My suggestions for Nathaniel for wedding planning can apply to any number of other professional
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:29.220]   situations in which a complicated thing involving many different vendors or clients and peers,
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.620]   colleagues has to come together.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:32.620]   Structure it.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:33.900]   Do not just rock and roll.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:40.820]   All right, let's do, I think we have time for one more question in this block.
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.020]   What's our final question of the first question block, Jesse?
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.580]   Final question is from Philippe.
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.460]   He lost his love for work and he's trying to get it back.
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:55.380]   He explains how he's working for a construction company and the railroad doing railways.
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.380]   And it's been his hobby since the child and he was always fulfilled.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:03.780]   But now he's wondering if she'd go back to university.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.460]   So he's trying to get it back.
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:07.460]   Right.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:12.740]   Well, Philip, and I'm thinking about your wording, I'm looking at it here.
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.940]   Clearly you don't want to go back to your academic job.
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.940]   I mean, look, I'm looking at words you wrote here.
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.420]   I lost my interest.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.740]   I had no motivation.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.860]   I felt deprived.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:29.180]   It completely sucked motivation and drive out of my brain and soul.
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:34.760]   You described your new field as your hobby since childhood and a source of fulfillment.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.900]   So okay, Philip, clearly you're not trying to set this up.
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:41.820]   So I say, go back to your PhD program.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:47.820]   More importantly, though, you don't need someone to answer that question for you because
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.620]   the stakes here are not that high.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.860]   And here's what I mean by it.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:59.360]   The focus in general of, but is this the right job for me is premised on the assumption that
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.740]   there is a right job for you.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.980]   Longtime listeners of the show and readers of my book know I do not subscribe to that
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:06.980]   notion.
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:10.220]   I do not believe in that idea that we're each wired with an inborn passion that we were
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:14.980]   born with, and the key to professional success is to match your job to that passion.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:17.220]   That's not the way it works.
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:22.060]   Passion and meaning and fulfillment are cultivated over time through the very careful crafting
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:28.300]   of a career in conjunction with a clear vision of your ideal lifestyle.
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:32.740]   Many different jobs can be deployed like tools in your toolbox to build this life that's
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:33.940]   deeply meaningful.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:37.220]   So you know, things didn't work out in your academic position.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.700]   There's a longer elaboration here about what happened there, departmental infighting, etc.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:41.700]   etc.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.700]   I'm looking at it now.
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:47.340]   And you found something else that works, has options, matches interest.
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.740]   Great, good.
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.900]   That step is done.
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.300]   You got the clay.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.860]   How do we mold this down to something cool?
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.420]   So I don't want you to focus too much.
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.420]   You're in this new job.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:57.420]   It's going well.
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.420]   Great.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:03.860]   Let's look forward to how you build a life that is deep, a life that is meaningful.
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:07.620]   Let's stop looking backwards at should I have done this instead?
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:08.900]   Is there another job that's going to be better?
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:12.940]   If you have a job that's working, that's the right job for you.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.900]   So stay in that job.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:15.900]   Fine.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.500]   But put your head forward.
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:20.620]   Start thinking through what's my ideal lifestyle?
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.420]   How do I shape my career towards it?
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:27.060]   I will suggest that you go back and listen to I think it's last week's episode, Jesse
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.060]   210.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.060]   I did.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:33.700]   I called it deep life, something deep life university, deep life academy, deep life
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.700]   academy.
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:40.700]   I named the segment deep life academy, but it was basically me going into detail about
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:45.660]   how to then design ideal lifestyle and come back and let that direct your career.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.660]   So that's where you are now.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:50.020]   And we're going to put that up or probably is up as a video clip or it will be by the
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.420]   time people listen to this.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.420]   Right?
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:53.420]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.420]   A hundred percent.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.420]   YouTube.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.420]   It came out last Thursday.
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.420]   Oh, it's already out.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.420]   So youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:01.540]   Look for that deep life academy video.
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:02.540]   But your job's fine.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.980]   Don't worry too much about the details.
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:04.980]   All right.
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.220]   So we have a good second block of questions to get to.
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:12.540]   This was some of the more philosophical questions that Jesse previewed.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.340]   First want to pay the bills briefly.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.260]   Talk about another sponsor.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.820]   That's our friends at 80,000 hours.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:24.180]   When I say friends, I mean that literally I've known the guys working on this since
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.300]   they got started years ago.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.580]   And that's because of what they focus on.
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:34.580]   The 80,000 hours refers to roughly speaking, the number of hours you have in your career.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.780]   So 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, 40 years, multiply those out.
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.700]   You get the 80,000.
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:47.080]   So those 80,000 hours are your biggest opportunity to make a positive impact on the world.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.820]   So it can be pretty hard to stressful to figure out what should I be doing with my working
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:53.540]   life to build the biggest impact with my 80,000 hours.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.860]   That's what this nonprofit does.
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.660]   It is dedicated to helping people do that.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:05.060]   So they take some of the best strategies, the best research, the best tactical advice
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:12.260]   out there, and they deliver it to the public for this philanthropic goal of having people
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:16.620]   be able to make a bigger positive impact with their working life.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:20.740]   So this nonprofit was founded by Will McCaskill from Oxford.
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:23.740]   You might know him because he's been on a lot of podcasts recently.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:25.420]   He did Ferris's podcast recently.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.140]   He did Sam Harris's podcast recently.
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.860]   I think he did maybe Ezra Klein's podcast recently.
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:30.860]   He has a new book out.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:36.020]   He's one of the founders of effective altruism, which is all about being quantitative and
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.740]   precise about what altruism is going to have the biggest impacts.
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:39.860]   You've probably heard of him.
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:43.960]   He's the founder of 80,000 hours.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.260]   So what can you do with them?
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.860]   You can join the free newsletter.
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:47.860]   All right.
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:53.260]   If you do that, they will send you an in-depth guide to help you do things like figure out
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:56.620]   problems that are pressing and figuring out how you can personally make the biggest impact.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:56:02.740]   They have a job board with over 800 opportunities to work on important problems and to get one
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:05.300]   on one advice about helping switching career paths.
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.020]   If that's what you end up wanting to do.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:11.580]   They have an excellent podcast, the 80,000 hours podcast that does in-depth conversations
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:14.020]   with experts about these issues.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.140]   Check out episode 94 with Ezra Klein.
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.140]   That's a good one.
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.940]   He's always a thoughtful guest.
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:22.300]   So I love the idea of this nonprofit.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:28.100]   To find out more, go to 80,000 hours.org/deep.
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:36.640]   That's 8000 hours, H-O-U-R-S.org/deep.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:37.640]   Check it out.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:38.640]   I really encourage you to go to that site.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.940]   Figure out how to make more out of your career.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.940]   Say it one more time.
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:43.940]   80,000 hours.org/deep.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:44.940]   80,000.
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:47.940]   That's one, two, three, four zeros.
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:48.940]   80,000 hours.org/deep.
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:58.960]   So let me also talk about another sponsor that is in the same vein.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.200]   I'd like these sponsors we have before the second block.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.220]   The second block of questions is more philosophical.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.840]   These are both philanthropic sponsors.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:10.780]   This new sponsor is called Giving What We Can.
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.920]   Most of us want to leave the world a better place.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:19.000]   Many of us give to charity to help make that a reality.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:28.560]   I for example have a charity where what we do is we teach deep work principles to infants
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:35.940]   so that we can inculcate the next generation of super focused workers.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:38.460]   So that's my charity.
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:39.460]   It's not a nonprofit.
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:47.420]   98% of the expenses go to support Jesse and I's lifestyle, mainly shipping his truck to
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:51.060]   Scotland, but 2% goes to the charity.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.420]   So have you ever wondered about how much impact your donations are having?
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.420]   So this is why I use my charity as an example.
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:00.180]   You may have given to that charity and then realized, my God, they are terrible misanthropes
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:05.900]   and I'm really mad that I gave my money to Cal and Jesse's infant deep work charity.
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:09.780]   This is why it matters that you have some way of figuring out what will this charity
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.400]   I want to give with actually do with my money.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.400]   This makes a difference.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:18.220]   The best charities out there can have 100 times more impact than an average charity
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:21.820]   and 100,000 more impacts than Jesse and I's charity.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:26.740]   What this means is donating $100 to an outstanding charity is as good as giving $10,000 to an
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.740]   average one.
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:31.500]   So it really helps your money go farther if you actually know who am I giving this money
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.800]   with and how good of stewards will they be.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.620]   Once we're giving what we can enters the picture.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:42.340]   It's a community of people dedicated to finding the best donation opportunities, working on
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.860]   some of the world's most important problems, right?
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.940]   So it doesn't matter if we're talking helping people, animals, climate change, pandemic
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:53.420]   preparedness, giving what we can has recommendations for highly effective charities you can trust.
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:58.100]   The recommendations are backed by tens of thousands of hours of research from charity
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:04.260]   evaluators and over 20,000 donors right now are trusting, giving what we can to make their
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.660]   decisions.
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:11.220]   So if you care about using your donation to do as much good as possible, go to giving
[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:18.300]   what we can.org/deep to start finding charities that can help you maximize your impact.
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:26.380]   That's giving what we can.org/deep.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:31.280]   Our charity has really taken a hit ever since giving what we can came along.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:36.020]   And then people who we're trying to get the work for our charity at lavish salaries, they're
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.620]   not coming anymore because of 80,000 hours.
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:39.380]   And they're like, "Oh, that's not a good job."
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:45.500]   So we were screwed because of these altruists that are actually doing good in the world.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.700]   Can't skim off our baby deep work charity.
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.700]   The infants aren't going to be focused.
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:49.700]   What are we going to do, man?
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:50.700]   Infants are the future.
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:51.700]   All right.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.340]   I think we have time for a couple more questions.
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.340]   What do we have next?
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:55.340]   All right.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:59.140]   So kind of talking about some of these deep life questions.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:06.500]   This question is from Joe and it's about, "Does Cal struggle with comparing himself
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.500]   to others?"
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.700]   No, because I'm the best.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.740]   All right.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.260]   That's the way I think about it.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:20.000]   I did compare myself to others and I'm better than them.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.660]   Now the real answer is yes and yes.
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.780]   I do compare myself to others and yes, it can be a problem because think about what
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.900]   I do for a living.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.020]   Two things, I'm an academic and I'm a writer.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:38.160]   Academia especially in theory like I'm in, but you can very precisely assess how good
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.160]   you are.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.620]   I mean, you can tell really fast where are you publishing, how much of those results
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:48.020]   getting cited, how much are you publishing?
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.340]   You can get to that quick.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:53.300]   It doesn't take me much time to figure out exactly where you stand in the pecking order
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.700]   of intellectualism.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.780]   And then if you actually have conversations with people, you can very quickly sort out,
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.780]   well, this person is more of a hot shot in this field than I am.
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.100]   I'm more of a hot shot than that person.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.100]   It's all pecking order.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.380]   It's like baseball.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.580]   You just walk around with your OPS.
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:08.140]   And I got to be careful about that because Jesse, just a quick aside, but you know we
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:13.060]   did the survey where we solicited feedback from listeners about what they liked and didn't
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.260]   like about the show and it was great and we got 400 responses.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:22.020]   I've never seen more unanimity than I saw in people making it clear to us that the thing
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:26.580]   they most do not want me to talk about on this show is baseball.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.580]   Get out.
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.580]   I'm not clear about that.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:32.460]   So I should, I should, but which I will now respond to it.
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.260]   And I'm going to come back to the question too, but let me now respond to with a, with
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:39.460]   a quick, with a quick sidetrack about baseball.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:43.260]   So you know, uh, I'm a fan of this broadcaster around here in the DC area.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:44.260]   Grant Paulson.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.260]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.940]   Who's an interesting character because he was a, a, a sports reporter savant.
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.600]   So it was like a kid.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.940]   He was in the locker room at the caps.
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.180]   I think he was on, he would go on Letterman because it was like this novelty.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.220]   It's like 10 year old who was a sports reporter.
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:00.380]   His whole life has been, has been focused on this.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:04.420]   So I mentioned him in an episode, like I got to find an excuse to have on the show so we
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.740]   can talk Nats, right?
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.140]   Get, get the details.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:14.500]   Well someone sent me an email the other day where I guess someone knows Grant and tweeted
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.500]   at him.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.000]   It was like, Hey, the worlds are coming together.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.740]   Like I always listen to deep questions and, and they're talking about you.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.380]   And Grant gave it a something, I don't know, a thumbs up emoji.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:31.500]   So he's, he's as good as a cohost at this point, which again, according, I can't emphasize
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:35.100]   this enough according to our survey, what people like and don't like about our podcast,
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.180]   it would literally be the end of the show.
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:41.900]   It'd be awesome because we just talked baseball until he realized, wait, what's your audience?
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:47.060]   Then he just hear footsteps and then, you know, his car, his car taken off.
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.060]   All right.
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.260]   Anyways, back to the real question for the listeners who remain.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:53.820]   Yes, in academia, it's very easy to compare yourself to others.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:58.020]   I mean, if anything, I was protected a little bit by the fact that I went to a place where
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:02.020]   people were so smart and I'm talking about the theory group at MIT that I didn't even
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:06.900]   have to see myself as being in the uncanny Valley as someone who could compete.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:10.780]   I mean, especially the faculty there, they were just so incandescent smart.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.780]   I was like, this is just cool.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:13.780]   Like, look at that, look what this guy's doing.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.740]   So that helped me a little bit, but yes, in academia, it's, it's crystal clear.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.420]   There's so many milestones you can see.
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.700]   Oh, you got tenure before me.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.700]   You're at this school is ranked here.
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:22.700]   And I'm at that school.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.700]   You published four papers.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.700]   You only did three.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.700]   You won the best paper award.
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.700]   You didn't crystal clear.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.380]   So yes, writing's the same thing.
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.820]   Success number of copies sold.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.180]   You can't escape the number.
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.980]   It directly influences how much you're paid for your books.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.420]   It's like, you can't escape it.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.420]   It's it's destiny.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:44.180]   So I'm in a world, two worlds where I can, I can see exactly where I stand.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:48.220]   As my wife will tell me, I tend to look up, not down.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:52.660]   So I mean, I'm happy about where I am, but also I'm always have this like ambitious next
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:53.660]   level I'm going to.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.660]   All right.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.660]   So how do I deal with that?
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:58.780]   Four pieces of advice that work for me.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:01.840]   Number one, be clear about your vision for your life.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.100]   Get excited about that vision.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.680]   So know specifically what you are trying to do.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.420]   What is your vision of a life well lived?
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:15.540]   We talked about in the last answer that from episode 210, I do a deep life academy segment
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.140]   about lifestyle centric career planning.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.140]   That's exactly what I'm talking about here.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:23.860]   So know what you have is your definition of success so that you're not going to be pushed
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:28.980]   around by arbitrary numbers is publishing the most papers of you in your field.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.620]   Your definition is that part of your vision, then you should care about that.
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.700]   But if it's not, then you shouldn't.
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.700]   All right.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.660]   So that leads us to point number two, which is don't worry about things not related to
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.460]   your vision.
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:44.220]   And when people do really cool things in your field that aren't directly related to what
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:48.140]   you are trying to do with your life, be proud of them, be impressed.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:49.140]   Like, that's cool.
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:50.140]   Look at that, man.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.500]   Look at this thing.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.780]   This guy wrote 10 papers last year.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:54.980]   That's awesome.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.800]   But like maybe you have a vision for your academic career, and I'm just making this
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:04.260]   up that involves you also doing a bit of writing and having some breathing room and maybe doing
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.660]   a podcast with Grant Paulson where you talk about baseball for three hours each year.
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.420]   So 10 papers a year was not part of your vision.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.020]   So you don't have to be upset at yourself for not doing that.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.020]   That's not part of the plan.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.020]   All right.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:23.140]   Number three, for people who are executing better than you on the things you care about,
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:29.100]   it's okay to have that light a fire, but aim that fire at process, not the person.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.780]   No, I definitely do this.
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.420]   I want to have a fire lit.
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:39.500]   Like, and this person is kind of in the same space as me, but selling more books.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.060]   I want, we can do that.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.060]   I want that.
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:43.060]   Why am I not there?
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.220]   Like, okay, we got to figure this out.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:47.420]   Or like just my academic, I'm not happy where I am.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.460]   I'm not the respect I'm getting at.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.900]   I'm not where I want to be.
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:53.780]   It's okay to let that light a fire if it's directly related to your vision of a life
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:56.740]   well live, but you aim that fire at your process, not at the person.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:02.100]   You don't look at that person and start thinking like, man, what's wrong with them?
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.260]   Or it's not fair.
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.660]   Or I can't, that guy's so awesome.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.660]   I'm so inferior.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.060]   You put the fire on your process.
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.860]   You're like, well, I'm on social media a lot.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.660]   Like I'm messing around with this other junk.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.860]   Like I got to get my act together.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:13.860]   I'm not really reading.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:14.980]   I need to simplify my life.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.340]   I got to refocus on the things that matter.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.500]   Light the fire, but aimed at it.
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:22.220]   What matters aiming at process.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:27.860]   Number four, never, and just make this a blanket rule.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:32.900]   Never try to take down someone else in the vein of hope.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:36.180]   It's going to make you feel better about you.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:40.700]   It is a hundred percent, the human instinct, especially in conversation with others.
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:48.500]   Like this guy's out selling me when I'm talking to Jesse, I'm going to kind of undercut him.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:52.980]   Like yeah, but you know, like this guy, he's got this weird timing.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.380]   He really, he's like friends with Joe Rogan and was on the show.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:56.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.960]   You sort of tried to like undercut it and your mind's like, this is going to work.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.860]   They're going to be like, yeah, you're right.
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:03.340]   I don't, I'm not impressed by him.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.820]   I'm impressed by you.
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:05.820]   That's right.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:06.820]   He didn't really deserve that.
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:07.820]   You're awesome.
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:08.820]   That never ever works.
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:13.820]   Most people see it exactly what it is, man, you are vindictive and jealous.
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.420]   And I now think about you less and you're just, and you're going to realize that and
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.420]   feel worse about yourself.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:18.540]   It never works.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:23.580]   So instead have the simple rule that whenever you feel the impulse to bring down someone
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:28.220]   who's doing better at something that you care about, whenever you feel that impulse, that
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.580]   should be a Pavlovian bell that says, okay, it's time for me to say something nice about
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.860]   him and just force yourself to say something nice about him.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.420]   That's a cool book.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.380]   It's impressive what he did with that.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.820]   Yeah, I wish, I wish that's great.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:43.420]   Oh, here, let me tell you something cool about that guy.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:44.420]   This is what I do.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:45.620]   This is my rule on podcasts, by the way.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:50.660]   Like if, if someone brings up on the interviewee and someone brings up someone else who I know
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:55.140]   or is in the field, my rule is almost always find something really cool, something cool
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.540]   about that person to emphasize, you know?
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.580]   Oh, well, let me tell you, let me, let me tell you something cool about Tim Ferriss
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.580]   that you might not have heard.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.020]   Like, you know, cool things about him.
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.700]   Here's something you might not have known that I think is also really cool.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:12.580]   I mean, otherwise you just get drowned in pettiness and jealousy and, uh, you end up,
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.300]   I don't know, up real late on Twitter.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:20.260]   And I think that's like most people on Twitter now is people who are just sort of upset at
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:25.020]   other people for various reasons and, uh, are in a cave and have the Phantom of the
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:30.340]   Opera half mask on and they're deformed because that's what happens if you use Twitter too
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:34.940]   much, you get the formed and they're at an Oregon and then just like tweeting, like you're
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:35.940]   awful emoji.
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:36.940]   It's my Twitter simulation.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:37.940]   Oh, well, okay, let's do one more.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:38.940]   All right.
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:39.940]   Final question is from Amy.
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:52.900]   She asked, how can I reset my ambitions after burning out?
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:56.940]   She's talking about how she's overwhelmed with her career and she's trying to improve
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:02.660]   at that and she's fresh off a burnout and is lost on where to start.
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:09.420]   It's a good question because I don't think we, we don't get into this enough burnout
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:10.420]   and the sources of burnout.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:14.740]   We don't get into that enough when we talk about optimistic forward-looking discussions
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:17.260]   of productivity and planning, organization, et cetera.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:20.860]   So let's, let's, let's be clear here.
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:23.140]   You need to do, you know, your lifestyle centric career planning.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.140]   That's the theme of this episode.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.060]   Lifestyle centric career planning is a great way.
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:31.540]   It's a theme of block two, at least know your vision, work backwards to figure out what
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:32.620]   to do with your career.
[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:34.820]   Here's the key.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:39.780]   Keep the sources of your burnout in mind when you construct that vision, it should be your
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:45.780]   vision of an ideal life should keep in mind the things that really tax you, the things
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:48.060]   that tend to accumulate and lead to burnout.
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.420]   Your ideal life should be a life in which you're free from burnout.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.220]   That has to be part of the vision.
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:59.580]   I think too often what people do is they invalidate the burnout and the things that lead to burnout.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:04.900]   Like that's malformed and successful people don't have that.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:09.620]   And so my vision of what I'm trying to do with my life has to be one that ignores that.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:14.500]   And it might be a vision that has all of the stressors, all of the anxiety triggers, all
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:18.180]   of the things that really don't match well with you and lead to burnout in it.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.180]   And that's not going to work.
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:23.300]   So build an ideal vision of a life should be a life without burnout, which means the
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:27.220]   things that cause the burnout should be largely absent from it.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:29.220]   I do this.
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:37.300]   I do this with my own planning, my vision with which I think about my life because my
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:41.100]   body has this really clear, I talk about this a bunch on the show.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:46.860]   It has this really clear feedback mechanism on don't like where you're going, the workload,
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:50.300]   the type of work and it's insomnia.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:55.120]   I have trouble sleeping when things get out of whack.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.900]   That feedback mechanism, and that's my burnout.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:02.260]   That feedback mechanism has a huge impact on the vision of my life that I build.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:09.260]   I steer away from visions, especially the professional part of my life that are getting
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:16.060]   after it busy, where it's a startup and it's like, let's go and we're going to just get
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:19.980]   after it and have all these different things going on and calls and meetings and we're
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.980]   going to move and we're going to build this thing big and make $20 million off of it.
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:29.060]   I have to steer away from that because if I have too much going on and then I might
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.980]   start getting insomnia, it'd be very hard to keep up those hard schedules.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:32.980]   It's a governor.
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.140]   So my vision doesn't involve that.
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:37.020]   Think about the visions that you see playing out of my own life.
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.820]   They're all slow productivity related.
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:45.020]   It's all based on things that no particular single day matters.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:50.020]   What matters is that over time, you're coming back again and again to work on this book.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.820]   Over time, you're thinking deep thoughts.
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:54.260]   Hey, tomorrow, if you're tired, who cares?
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.940]   But this month, you spent a lot of days thinking about this paper.
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.500]   You spent a lot of days working on this book.
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:03.480]   So I've constructed an ideal vision that keeps explicitly in mind the specific things that
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:08.140]   lead to my sources of burnout, my particular definition of burnout.
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:11.100]   I think that's really important.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:15.860]   If you get drained when you're not feeding off other people, you're very social, your
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:19.860]   family and friends are important, you better have a vision of your life in which you're
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.720]   not working 80 hours a week.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.980]   It's got to be a vision of your life where you live near family, where you spend a lot
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.460]   of time with community and friends.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:29.660]   I'm going to give a specific example here.
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:35.060]   There's a writer whose book I read, and I feel bad because I forgot the name of it.
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:37.340]   I think it's Donald Miller is his name.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:39.620]   He had a self-help advice book.
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:45.440]   But anyways, the thing that I remember from that book is they bought a bunch of land outside
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.060]   of Nashville and built it.
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:51.180]   They wanted it to be like a retreat center and a place where writers and musicians and
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:56.140]   artists they know could always be coming through and having retreats and working.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:00.300]   They could be outside a lot, work on the land a lot, have a lot of people they found really
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.300]   interesting there.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:06.420]   It was a vision of success for this person in the world of business that really focused
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.900]   on what he needed.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:14.500]   Probably this would be someone where 90 hours in their office at McKinsey, where you're
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:20.260]   not seeing anybody and you're just cut off and you and your spreadsheet would be immiserating.
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:24.660]   Your vision is what I'm trying to say here, has to keep your sources of burnout in mind
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:30.380]   because your vision needs to be one in which burnout is infrequent and unexpected when
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.380]   it does happen.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:32.380]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:36.540]   I mean, so update your vision and it might require radical change.
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:42.660]   If the source of your burnout is going to be unavoidable, you're in an academic department
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:46.580]   where there's acrimony through the roof and it just stresses you out and you can't get
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:50.340]   more than a semester or two without just it wearing you down.
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.320]   You might have to do something radically different.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.100]   You need a vision of your life in which that doesn't happen.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:00.820]   So I want to validate your burnout and say, use that in your planning.
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.500]   All right.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:07.740]   Speaking of burnout, we've been at it a lot.
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:09.220]   We're recording late today, actually, right, Jesse?
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:13.740]   I mean, we usually record earlier in the day, but I gave a talk, I did a meeting, I was
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:17.140]   closing out a New Yorker article, then we did this recording.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.580]   So I declare myself burnt out.
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:26.620]   The episode really tied itself together from the first question to the last question.
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.260]   Even last week with lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:30.620]   Yeah, I know.
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:33.540]   The questions seem to be clustered now.
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:38.500]   And I'm optimistic going forward because we're switching, starting with this episode, to
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.660]   a brand new question survey.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.340]   So this is insider baseball.
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:50.540]   Up until this point, we would send out periodic surveys to solicit questions to my email list.
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:52.980]   And then we would use those questions until they were done.
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:59.980]   And then we would send out a new survey, which meant we're working now on a survey from December,
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.900]   I think, that only went to my email list.
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:05.820]   So we've switched, started with this episode, that anyone can submit questions at any time
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:10.620]   at a persistent open collection survey, calnewport.com/podcast.
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:14.380]   But I think because we're starting from right now, everyone asking questions are going to
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:19.540]   be completely up to date with what we talk about, the rhythm of the show.
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:22.580]   And so I think the questions we're going to get going forward are going to be more on
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.580]   point.
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.340]   Also, we're asking for case studies now.
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:30.700]   I want to spend more time talking about the details of people's lives, what they've done
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.340]   right, ways they have found depth in their work or life is impressive.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:35.060]   So we're going to have some more case studies as well.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:38.620]   So I'm excited about what we're going to have going forward.
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:42.220]   So the new format is going to be we're going to get a quick question out of the way, three
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.180]   hours with Grant.
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:47.200]   So we're going to because we have to have an hour on like the minor league system update,
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:51.260]   we got to have an hour on you know, what's happening with like the vet players and the
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:57.740]   free agent season and then just like an hour on I think, the Watson and the development
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:58.740]   staff.
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:15:59.740]   So three hours on that.
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:00.740]   Then we'll do another question.
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:01.740]   And that'll be the show.
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:06.460]   So I think we got a pretty good, pretty good show.
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.900]   Pretty, pretty good format.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:08.900]   Yeah.
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:15.140]   Again, I cannot be more clear about how much people do not want us talking about baseball
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:20.260]   by far the most common thing cited in don't talk.
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.260]   So I am great.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.660]   I haven't mentioned the word.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.460]   I am great at listening to stories.
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:26.460]   All right.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.460]   That's enough.
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.460]   Enough nonsense.
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:30.060]   Thank you everyone for listening.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.780]   Go to calnewport.com/podcast to submit your own questions.

[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:43.180]   stay deep.
