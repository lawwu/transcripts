[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.460]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.940]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.680]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.880]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.160]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.240]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.920]   to the general public.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.360]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.360]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.240]   Our first sponsor is Roka.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.280]   Founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.400]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses have really been designed
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.560]   with the utmost care and the utmost attention
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.680]   to the science of optics and the visual system.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.280]   So one of the things I like so much
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.400]   about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.600]   is that they're extremely lightweight.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.240]   If you get sweaty, so for instance,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.420]   if you wear them while running or walking or hiking,
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.000]   they don't slip off.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.480]   And with the sunglasses, when you're outdoors,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.960]   if there's cloud cover or if there's shadows,
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.640]   or if the day gets brighter or dimmer,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.200]   you can still see your surroundings perfectly well.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.000]   And that's because the designers at Roka
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.560]   really understand the way the visual system works,
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.760]   how it habituates, how it adapts.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.560]   You don't need to understand the science behind all that,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380]   but they do, and as a consequence,
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.480]   the eyeglasses perform extremely well under all conditions,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.460]   whether or not that's indoors or outdoors.
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.880]   So they put a ton of science and purpose into the design.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.360]   They also happen to look really good.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.040]   They have a really nice aesthetic.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.120]   A lot of, as you know, performance,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.260]   active wear eyeglasses look rather ridiculous,
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.960]   but the Roka glasses, I think,
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.720]   have a very nice aesthetic to them
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.000]   that you could wear anywhere.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.600]   If you'd like to check out Roka glasses,
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.700]   you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.120]   and you'll get 20% off your first order.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.680]   That's Roka, R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.620]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.320]   for 20% off your order.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.640]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.060]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.800]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.320]   to help you better understand your body
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.200]   and reach your health goals.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.840]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.560]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.620]   that impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.280]   can only be analyzed from a blood test.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.660]   And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.960]   we can also get insight into our specific DNA makeup
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.680]   and how that influences our lifestyle choices
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.960]   and our health status.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.680]   The problem with a lot of blood tests
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.600]   is that you get a lot of information back,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.520]   but you don't always know what to do with that information.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.840]   With Inside Tracker, they have a very easy to use,
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.580]   personalized dashboard platform that informs you
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.400]   what sorts of lifestyle, nutrition, exercise changes
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.880]   you might want to make
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.600]   according to the levels of particular metabolic factors,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.560]   hormone factors, et cetera, in your blood and DNA.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.080]   So it makes everything very simple
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.560]   both in terms of where you're at health-wise
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.000]   and what you should or could do
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.320]   in order to improve your health,
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.560]   something I do believe most everybody would like to do.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.680]   With Inside Tracker, it makes all that very easy.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.940]   They also have something called the Inner Age Test.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.040]   This is a test that shows you what your biological age
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.680]   and compares that, of course, to your chronological age.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.080]   And of course, your biological age
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.260]   is really what you want to know
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.240]   because it's a predictor of how long
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.680]   you're going to live and the quality of your life.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.200]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.400]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.240]   And if you do that,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.360]   you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.760]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.960]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.100]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.040]   that are ideally suited to your sleep needs.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.000]   Everybody needs something different
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.360]   in terms of what to sleep on.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.920]   Some people like a hard mattress,
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.200]   some people like a soft mattress,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.560]   some people tend to run warm,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.440]   some people tend to run cold.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.480]   With Helix Sleep, you go to their website,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.860]   you take a very brief two-minute quiz,
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.520]   and you answer some questions such as,
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.800]   do you tend to sleep on your stomach
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   or your side or your back?
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.560]   Maybe you don't know.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.760]   Do you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera?
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.520]   At the end of that quiz, you match to a specific mattress.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.160]   I took that quiz about six months ago
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.440]   and I matched to the dusk mattress,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.120]   and I've been sleeping on a dusk mattress
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.680]   from Helix for the last six months,
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.200]   and I've been sleeping better than I ever have before.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   Basically, everyone's unique and Helix understands that,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.460]   and that's built into the design of their mattresses
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.420]   and this two-minute quiz that you take to match you to one.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.500]   If you'd like to try a Helix Sleep mattress,
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.680]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.200]   take their two-minute quiz,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.500]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.400]   You'll also get up to $200 off any mattress order
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.360]   and two free pillows.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.300]   They make terrific pillows.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.720]   You'll get a 10-year warranty on that mattress,
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.880]   and you get to try it out for 100 nights risk-free.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.600]   If you don't like it, they'll come pick it up
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.440]   and take it away.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.720]   You won't get charged, you'll get your money back, et cetera.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.520]   So that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.280]   for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.200]   We are now beginning a new topic
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.360]   for the next four to five episodes
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.600]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.080]   Before we move into that,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.340]   I want to just briefly touch on a couple of questions
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.240]   that I got from the last episode,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.380]   which was related to the science of endurance training.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.540]   I described the four kinds of endurance training.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.640]   We posted protocols of the specific four kinds
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.320]   of endurance training at hubermanlab.com.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.400]   Just go to that episode.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.360]   You can see the download.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.240]   It's a zero-cost PDF.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.920]   I got a lot of questions
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.040]   about what's called concurrent training,
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.840]   which is how to program endurance training
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.560]   if you are also interested
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.560]   in strength and hypertrophy training,
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.280]   or how to incorporate strength and hypertrophy training,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.760]   which was in the previous episode, with endurance training.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.200]   This can all be made very simple.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.360]   Ask yourself, what are you trying to emphasize?
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.460]   And then emphasize that for a 10 to 12-week cycle.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.380]   So if you're mostly interested in endurance,
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.920]   I would say use a three to two ratio.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.000]   Maybe get three endurance training workouts per week,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.440]   maybe four, and two strength and hypertrophy workouts.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.280]   If you're mainly focusing on strength and hypertrophy,
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.220]   get three or four workouts for strength and hypertrophy,
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.200]   and do two endurance workouts.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.360]   Start with the minimum number of sets that's required
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.740]   to get the result that you want.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.140]   So if you're not accustomed to doing endurance work,
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.640]   you would start with the minimum number
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.200]   that's listed on that protocol.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.520]   So if it says three to five sets,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.080]   you would start with three, maybe even just two,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.040]   and then work your way up by adding sets each week.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.480]   I do suggest that people get
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   at least one complete rest day per week,
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.160]   although I know a lot of people don't like that.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.060]   I benefit from that.
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.240]   I actually benefit from having two complete rest days
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.080]   each week.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.480]   I just continue to make progress that way,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.480]   whether or not it's for strength and hypertrophy
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.160]   or for endurance.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.800]   I am a big believer in rest days.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.760]   Other people are not.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.660]   And those can be active rest days, hiking, relaxing, et cetera.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.960]   After a 10 to 12 week cycle,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.200]   then I also suggest taking anywhere
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.520]   from five to seven days completely off.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.140]   You can still enjoy life and do things.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.540]   I know for you addicted exercisers
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.020]   that you're going to loathe to do that,
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.660]   but that's one way to stay injury-free,
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.760]   keep your joints and tissues healthy over time,
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.260]   and continue to make progress.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260]   If you don't want to do that week off, don't do it.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.180]   None of this is holy.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.900]   None of it is a strict prescriptive.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.940]   Just ask yourself, what are you going to emphasize?
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.020]   And emphasize that in terms of the total volume
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.880]   of workouts that you do, and work up incrementally,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.320]   and then move into another cycle.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.600]   That's what I suggest.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.940]   So go to Hubermanlab.com.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.740]   You can get the protocol there.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.940]   We are now going to move into a new topic
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.780]   unrelated to physical performance,
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.500]   starting with this episode.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.460]   And for the next four to five episodes,
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.260]   we are going to talk all about the senses.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.320]   That's sight, eyesight, hearing, touch,
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.900]   taste, smell.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.520]   And we are also going to talk about this critical sense
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.140]   that we call interoception,
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.000]   or our sense of our internal real estate.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.720]   Now, the reason that we are talking about the senses
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.740]   is because if you understand
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.540]   how the senses are perceived, what they're about,
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.940]   what the underlying cells and connections are about,
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.940]   you will be in a terrific position
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.180]   to understand the month's topic that follows,
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.540]   which is all about mental health.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.780]   Now, I want to emphasize that if you're somebody
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.700]   who doesn't have any trouble
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.740]   seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling,
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.220]   and has an excellent sense of interoception,
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.860]   I do believe that these episodes
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.960]   will still be very relevant to you
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.300]   because they have everything to do
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.440]   with how you move through the world,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.820]   how you make sense of information,
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.340]   and how you organize your thoughts and your emotions.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.460]   I also want to emphasize
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.020]   that we're going to cover a lot of practical tools.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.020]   So today's episode is going to be all about vision
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.760]   and eyesight, a topic that's very near and dear to my heart
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.980]   because it's the one that I've been focusing on
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.020]   for well over 25 years of my career.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.740]   But we're not just going to get into the mechanistic details
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.740]   about how light is converted into electrical potentials
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.020]   and things like that.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.900]   We are going to talk about practical tools
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.380]   that you can and should use
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.620]   to help maintain the health of your visual system
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.500]   and your eyesight.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.700]   Very often, young people will say, what should I do?
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.640]   You know, you're always talking about, you know,
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.320]   neuroplasticity and how it tapers off over time,
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.380]   but I'm a young person, what should I do?
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.460]   You should absolutely train and support your eyesight.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.500]   In fact, if you're a young person and you see perfectly,
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.100]   or you feel as if you see the world perfectly,
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.060]   you are in the best position to bolster,
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.140]   to reinforce that visual system
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.980]   so that you don't lose your vision as you age.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.160]   In addition, you can leverage your visual system
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.060]   for better mental and physical performance,
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.640]   and we're going to talk about that.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.820]   If you're somebody who suffers
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.220]   from a clinical disorder of vision, you have trouble seeing,
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.620]   or if you need corrective lenses in order to see,
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.360]   this episode is definitely for you.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.060]   And while, of course, I can't make clinical diagnoses,
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.120]   I can't have a one-to-one conversation
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.300]   with any of you in this format, nor am I a clinician,
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.220]   I'm a scientist, not a physician,
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.740]   I did consult with our chair of ophthalmology,
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.100]   Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg at Stanford University
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.580]   School of Medicine, as well as several other people
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.540]   to really vet the information and make sure
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.220]   that the protocols that I'm describing
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.560]   are consistent with the clinical literature.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.840]   If you have a severe eye problem,
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.560]   you should be working with a really good ophthalmologist
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.700]   and/or optometrist, but certainly an ophthalmologist
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.380]   who's a medical doctor.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.300]   But I do believe that the information
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.600]   that we're going to discuss today
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.260]   is going to be relevant to everybody,
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.540]   and we'll set the stage for the month on mental health.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.460]   And mental performance.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.100]   So let's get started.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.740]   When we hear the word vision,
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.060]   we most often think about eyesight,
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.180]   or our ability to perceive shapes and objects
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.000]   and faces and colors.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.100]   And indeed, vision involves eyesight,
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.120]   our ability to see shapes and objects
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.440]   and faces and colors and so forth.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   However, our eyes are responsible for much more than that,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.280]   including our mood, our level of alertness,
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.300]   and all of that is included in what we call vision.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.900]   So I just want to take about three, maybe four minutes,
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.380]   and talk about how the visual system works,
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.860]   how it's built, and how you are able to so-called
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.540]   see things around you.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.220]   I also want to describe the ways in which your eyes
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.120]   and your visual system impact your mood
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.900]   and your level of alertness.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.740]   And then we are going to get right into some protocols,
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.060]   some specific things that each and all of you
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.620]   should do if you want to enhance your vision
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.480]   and maintain your vision as you get older.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.360]   And again, if you're a 15-year-old or a 12-year-old,
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.940]   this episode is especially for you
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.220]   because your nervous system is far more plastic than mine is.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.900]   It's much more amenable to change,
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.820]   so you can really build a very strong visual system.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.120]   And in doing that, and if you adopt specific behaviors
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.720]   at any age of light viewing at particular times
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.420]   in particular ways, then you can build an emotional system
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.920]   that's also reinforced by your visual system.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.000]   So let's talk about vision.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.840]   What is vision?
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.180]   Well, vision starts with the eyes.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:15.380]   We have no what's called extraocular light perception.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.880]   While it feels good to have light on our skin,
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.440]   while it feels good to be outside in the sunlight
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.720]   for most people, the only way that light information
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.820]   can get to the cells of your body
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.380]   is through these two little goodies
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.220]   on the front of your face.
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.280]   And for those of you listening, I'm just pointing to my eyes.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.380]   As many of you have heard me say before
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.980]   on this and other podcasts, your eyes in particular,
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.940]   your neural retinas are part of your central nervous system.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.280]   They are part of your brain.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.520]   They're the only part of your brain
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.940]   that sits outside the cranial vault.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.220]   In other words, you have two pieces of your brain
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.760]   that deliberately got squeezed out of the skull
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.640]   during development and placed in these things
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.000]   we call eye sockets.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.260]   There's a genetic program for the specific purpose
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.320]   of making sure that three little layers of neurons,
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.680]   nerve cells got squeezed out
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.200]   and form what are called your neural retinas.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.160]   Now the eyes have a lot of other goodies in them
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.280]   that are very important.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.760]   And those are the goodies that we're going to focus on
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.320]   a lot today.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.640]   There's a lens to focus light precisely to the retina.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.460]   If you're somebody who requires eyeglasses or contacts,
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.320]   chances are you don't do that correctly.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.480]   And so that's why you use other lenses
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.560]   like eyeglasses or contacts.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.080]   There are also other pieces of the eye
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.520]   that are designed to keep the eye lubricated.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.800]   You also have these things that we call eyelashes.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.060]   Most people don't know this,
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.960]   but eyelashes are there to trigger the blink reflex
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.180]   if a piece of dust or something gets in front of your eye.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.300]   It's a beautiful adaptation of nature.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.880]   They aren't just aesthetically nice.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.900]   Costello happens to have very long eyelashes.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.280]   He gets compliments about this all the time.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.720]   Maybe you have long eyelashes.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.560]   I don't have particularly long eyelashes,
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.360]   but the eyelashes are there so that if a piece of dust
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.840]   or something starts to head towards the cornea,
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.640]   the eye blinks very, very fast.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.800]   It's the fastest reflex you own is your eye blink reflex.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.120]   We also have these things called eyelids.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.680]   Now, eyelids might seem like the most boring topic of all,
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.460]   but they are incredibly fascinating.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.000]   Today, we're going to talk about
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.720]   how you can actually use your visual system
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.360]   to increase your levels of alertness
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.960]   based on the neural circuits that link your brainstem
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.640]   with your eyelids.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.800]   And no, we are not going to have a blinking contest
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.920]   because I would win and you would lose,
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.840]   and that wouldn't be fun for you.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.840]   So let's talk about what the eyes do for vision.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.260]   Basically, the entire job of the eyes
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.600]   is to collect light information
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.280]   and send it off to the rest of the brain
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.120]   in a form that the brain can understand.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.560]   Remember, no light actually gets in
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.020]   past those neural retinas.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.060]   It gets to the neural retina,
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.820]   and we have specific cells in the eye called photoreceptors.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.100]   They come in two different types, rods and cones.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.920]   Cones are mainly responsible for daytime vision,
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.540]   and the rods are mainly responsible for vision at night
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.200]   or under low light conditions, generally speaking.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.220]   So basically what happens is if your eyelids are open,
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.220]   light comes into the eye, the lens focuses that light.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.560]   Light is also just called photons, light energy,
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.680]   onto the retina.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.780]   These photoreceptors, the rods and cones,
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.620]   have chemical reactions inside them
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.720]   that involve things like vitamin A,
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.840]   and that chemical reaction converts the light
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.480]   into electricity.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.840]   Now, that might seem incredibly abstract,
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.260]   but the way to think about this is very similar to,
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.600]   for instance, you have touch receptors on your skin,
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.560]   and when you press on those touch receptors,
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.200]   they convert pressure, physical pressure,
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.240]   into electrical information,
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.320]   and those neurons send it up to your spinal cord and brain.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.280]   You can register that somebody or you are touching
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.580]   the top of your hand, as I'm doing now.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.840]   With the eyes and the retina,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.280]   it's just that light gets converted
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.460]   into electrical information.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.440]   Within the eye, within the retina,
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.800]   there are then a series of stages of processing,
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.840]   and that information eventually gets sent into the brain
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.400]   by a very specific class of neurons.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.820]   I would like you to know the names of these neurons.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.700]   They're called retinal ganglion cells.
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.940]   So the only thing you need to know
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.240]   about the neuroscience of the eye at this point
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.920]   are that they're rods and cones.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.900]   The cones are involved in bright daytime vision,
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.980]   and rods are involved in more dusk or nighttime vision,
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.660]   and you've got these cells called retinal ganglion cells
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.720]   that send the information off to the rest of the brain.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.360]   Now, here's what's incredible.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.000]   I just want you to ponder this for a second.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.460]   This still blows my mind.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.880]   Everything you see around you,
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.640]   you're not actually seeing those objects directly.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.040]   What you're doing is you're making a best guess
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.920]   about what's there based on the pattern of electricity
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.900]   that arrives in your brain.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.880]   Now, that might just seem totally wild
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.360]   and hard to wrap your head around,
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.200]   but think about it this way,
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.640]   because this is the way it actually works.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.460]   Let's take an example of a color like green or blue.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.260]   You have cones in your eye that respond best
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.080]   to the wavelength of light that is reflected off,
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.520]   say, a green apple.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.200]   So you don't actually see the green apple.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.460]   What you see is the light bouncing off that green apple,
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.120]   and it goes into your eye,
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.960]   and you see it and perceive it as round and green,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.620]   but not because you see anything green.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.400]   No green light arrives in your brain.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.560]   What happens is your brain actually compares
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.600]   the amount of green reflection coming off that apple
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.880]   to the amount of red and blue around it.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.280]   Well, you might say, "Well, the green apple's sitting
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.080]   on a brown table or a white surface."
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.040]   Well, then it will appear very green,
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.080]   because the amount of wavelength of light for green
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.980]   is very high, and the amount for red is very low,
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.720]   and so it looks very green, okay?
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.960]   So we don't actually see anything directly.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.300]   What the brain is receiving is a series of signals,
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.960]   electrical signals, and it's comparing electrical signals
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.100]   in order to come up with what we call these perceptions,
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.860]   like I see something green, a green apple, or I see red.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.760]   Let me give you a slightly different example.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.620]   If you were to play a key on the piano,
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.500]   let's say you play, I'm not a musician,
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.320]   but I'm going to, so hopefully I won't get this
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.260]   too incorrectly, but let's say you have like E sharp,
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.480]   and maybe it's on ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.380]   If the brain gets that signal, it doesn't actually know E.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.640]   That's what, it doesn't recognize it
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.540]   until you were to play another key next to it,
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.880]   dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.420]   And what it does is it does the math,
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.020]   it does the subtraction, and it compares those two.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.800]   So when we see something green or we see something red
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.240]   or we see something blue,
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.700]   we're not actually seeing it directly.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.680]   The brain is making a guess about how green or red or blue
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   that thing is by comparing what's around it, okay?
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.800]   And if that seems hard to wrap your head around,
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.080]   don't worry because we will explain it in more depth
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.720]   going forward, but I really want people to understand this,
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   that vision, eyesight is not looking at things directly
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.400]   and that information getting directly into your brain,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.120]   it is translated.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.320]   Light information is transformed into electrical signals
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.800]   that your visual system exquisitely understands.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.200]   Now, what does this mean?
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.520]   Why should you care about this?
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.240]   Well, if you have a dog like I do or a cat,
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.240]   they are not colorblind, but they lack the cones
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.140]   that respond to red, meaning long wavelength light.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.720]   So what does that mean?
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.840]   That means that when they see green,
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.900]   it's different than the green you see,
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.440]   not because that apple isn't visible to them,
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.560]   but because they aren't able to compare it to red,
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.320]   and you are.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.160]   As a consequence, when they look at a green lawn,
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.140]   it looks more brownish or orange to them.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.600]   When you wear a red shirt in front of your dog or cat,
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.240]   if you see a stop sign and they see a stop sign,
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.560]   they see orangish brown and you see red,
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.400]   presuming that you are a trichromat,
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.680]   meaning you have three color vision.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.980]   So this is all to say that every animal
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.840]   sees the world differently depending on whether or not
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.520]   they have one or two or three of these different cones,
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.640]   the red, blue, or green cones.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.660]   If you are a mantis shrimp of all things,
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:40.660]   you see hundreds of colors that human beings can't see.
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:45.980]   Many animals see into visual ranges
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.560]   that you and I can't see in.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.040]   So for instance, a pit viper senses heat emissions.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.180]   It literally sees the heat coming off of you
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.760]   or of an animal that they want to eat.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.760]   If you are a ground squirrel, you can see ultraviolet light.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.820]   This is going to sound kind of weird,
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.720]   but ground squirrels actually signal one another
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.740]   by standing up outside and shining sunlight
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.880]   off each other's stomachs to each other,
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.760]   signaling at a distance, just like, you know,
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.240]   you could signal somebody with a mirror
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.960]   in sunlight at distance.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.260]   There are species of primates,
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.640]   this isn't very pleasant to think about,
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.160]   that urinate on their hands
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.620]   and then wipe it all over their stomach
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.180]   and then use that sunlight to reflect
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.260]   different signals to each other.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.100]   I don't know what they're saying.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.680]   We always assume it's something cute and nice,
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.600]   but maybe they're insulting each other.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.080]   So this actually gets right down to the heart
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.220]   of these bigger questions like consciousness.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.920]   What do we see? What's out there?
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.180]   How much of life is really accessible to us?
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.340]   And I could go on and on.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.140]   You know, this used to be kind of an obsession of mine
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.220]   when I was coming up in the field of visual neuroscience
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.800]   to understand how different animals
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.340]   see the world compared to us.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.660]   You know, I'll give one more example, a diving bird,
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.800]   you know, a bird that flies over the ocean.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.780]   It has an incredible task.
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.940]   It has to both view the horizon
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.580]   and it has to view schools of fish.
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.860]   And then it has to make a trajectory down into the water
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.500]   and grab one of those fish to eat.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.840]   And the water has what's called a refractory index.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.580]   It actually shifts like a prism,
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.380]   the impression or the perception of where that fish is,
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.220]   right?
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.020]   If the bird sees the fish right below it,
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.940]   it has to know, it has to adjust its diving trajectory
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.500]   just right because it knows that that fish
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.500]   actually isn't where it sees it.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.260]   It's probably a few inches ahead or to the side of that
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.160]   because of the way that water diverts the image.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.580]   If you've ever dropped a coin to the bottom of a pool,
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.940]   if you go straight down looking at that location,
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.340]   if you were to look from the top of the pool
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.140]   and you dive straight down with your eyes closed,
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.100]   you will miss because the water refracts.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.340]   It shifts the visual image.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.400]   Well, diving birds have an arrangement
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.580]   of these retinal cells that communicate to the brain.
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.760]   That's both a streak to view the horizon
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.820]   'cause they need to know where they are
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.860]   relative to the horizon.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.500]   And they have a pupil like we do on the bottom of their eye
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.020]   so that they can make very accurate dive and attacks
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.420]   on these schools of fish and catch fish and eat those fish.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.900]   We just have pupils in the middle of our eyes.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.360]   So there's a ton about the optics of the eye
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.500]   and the way that it communicates with the brain
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.060]   that allows us to see.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.500]   We could spend hours talking about this,
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.940]   but what I'd like to embed in your mind
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.280]   is that what you experience in the outside world
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.300]   is bottlenecked, it's limited by which wavelengths,
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.740]   which colors, if you will, of light that you can see,
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.940]   that your brain is coming up with a best guess
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:29.820]   about what's there.
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.820]   It doesn't actually know what's there.
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.060]   And that your vision is distinctly different
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.100]   from say the vision of a dog
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.180]   or from the vision of somebody who's a dichromat,
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.500]   meaning they don't have a red cone.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.900]   A lot of people, in particular about one in 80 males,
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.100]   lacks a red cone and therefore sees the world
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.860]   much the same way that Costello does,
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.820]   although he sees it from just much lower toward the ground.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.140]   So that's what I'd like you to understand
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.980]   about the way the eye communicates with the brain.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.260]   I would also like you to understand
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.860]   that the brain itself is making these guesses
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.140]   and that those guesses are largely right.
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.660]   How do I know that?
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.220]   Well, they're right because when you reach out
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.340]   to grab a glass, most of the time you grab the glass
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.340]   and you don't miss, right?
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.220]   Most of the time when you make judgments
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.580]   about the world around you
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.580]   based on your visual impression of them,
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.240]   it allows you to move functionally through the world.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.640]   But let me give you some examples
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.800]   of where this guessing is happening right now.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.740]   And it's so incredible that to this day,
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.960]   this still blows my mind.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.200]   Cover one eye with one hand.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.560]   If you're driving, maybe don't do this.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.300]   If you're viewing the world around you,
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.920]   presumably you can see everything that's out there.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.120]   I could do this with one eye or the other eye.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.760]   You probably see better out of one or the other
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.060]   and we'll talk about that.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.840]   You have a giant blind spot
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.600]   in the middle of your visual field.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.600]   It's called your blind spot.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.560]   It is the spot in which the connections,
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.840]   the wires from all those retinal ganglion cells
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.640]   exit the back of the eye and head off toward the brain.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.960]   In other words, you are blind for a huge spot
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.840]   of your central vision, the part of your vision
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.040]   that's highest acuity, highest detail.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.560]   And yet you don't see that ever.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.880]   You cover one eye and you see perfectly fine.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.080]   And it's not just because your eye
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.640]   is moving around really quickly.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.900]   Your brain is guessing what's in that spot,
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.520]   which is absolutely incredible.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.120]   And so you don't see that blind spot.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.300]   This is happening all the time.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.320]   Now, when you have two eyes open,
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.140]   the way that your eyes are positioned in your head
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.460]   and the way they view the world is such
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.640]   that they fill in each other's blind spot.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.420]   So it's pretty convenient.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.520]   But if you cover one eye, that's impossible
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.540]   and yet you still see the world as complete.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.360]   So the brain is doing these incredible things.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.900]   It's also creating depth, a sense of depth,
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.400]   even though what arrives from the retina
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.520]   is essentially a readout of a two-dimensional flat image.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.760]   So it can sense depth.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.800]   How do you know depth?
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.120]   Well, this is very simple.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.520]   Things that are closer to you tend to be larger
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.280]   than things that are far away.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.160]   Things that are closer to you tend to look
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.480]   like they're moving faster.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.680]   If you've ever been in a train and you look to your side,
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.080]   the rungs on a fence or the train tracks going by you,
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.280]   look like they're going very fast.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.160]   If you look off in the distance,
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.220]   they look like they're moving very slowly.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.180]   And there are differences between what's close to you
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.320]   and what's further away.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.880]   So a little house on the horizon,
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.720]   you don't look at and say,
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.700]   "Oh, that must be a tiny little house."
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.240]   You have some prior knowledge
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.660]   that things further away are smaller.
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.120]   So that's the main way that you do that.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   And you compare the location at which information
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.400]   about light lands on the two eyes.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.520]   So your eyes are slightly offset from one another.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.160]   So that, for instance, if I look at you,
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.760]   if you were standing right in front of me right now
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.000]   and I were to look at you,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.160]   the image of your face, the light bouncing off your face,
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.800]   to be more precise, lands on one eye
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.560]   in a slightly different location
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.960]   than it does in the other eye.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.860]   And then the brain does math.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.200]   It basically does the equivalent of geometry
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.880]   and trigonometry and essentially figures out
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.500]   how far away you are from me, which is just incredible.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.040]   So the brain does all this very, very fast.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.160]   And the brain uses about 40 to 50%
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.320]   of its total real estate for vision.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.940]   That's how important vision is.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.720]   Now, for those of you that are blind
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.460]   or low vision or no vision,
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.840]   that real estate in the brain will be taken over
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.160]   by neurons that control a sense of touch
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.120]   and a sense of hearing.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.800]   And you're indeed hearing and touch are much better,
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.360]   higher acuity and faster in blind people.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.440]   But for most of you who I presume are sighted,
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.140]   this is how it works.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.240]   So that's kind of vision from eye to brain in a nutshell.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.740]   There are a bunch of different stations in the brain
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.720]   that do different things.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.480]   That's eyesight.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.460]   Now I want to talk about the other aspect of vision,
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.720]   which is the stuff that you don't perceive,
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   the subconscious stuff.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.740]   And then we'll transition directly
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.400]   into how you can use light and eyesight
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.680]   to control this other stuff, because it's very important.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   And that other stuff is mood, sleep, and appetite.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.280]   And there are ways in which you can use these same protocols
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.800]   that I will describe in order to preserve
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.520]   and even enhance your vision,
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.440]   your ability to see things and consciously perceive them.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.500]   So the protocols we will describe have a lot of carryover
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.280]   to both conscious eyesight
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.420]   and to these subconscious aspects of vision.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.360]   And I just want you to understand a little bit more
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.440]   about the science of seeing of eyesight and vision,
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.520]   and then all the protocols will make perfect sense.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.700]   So as amazing as eyesight is,
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:50.000]   it actually did not evolve for us to see shapes and colors
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.900]   and motion and form.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.040]   The most ancient cells in our eyes,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.640]   and the reason we have eyes,
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.580]   is to communicate information about time of day
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.760]   to the rest of the brain and body.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.040]   Remember, there's no extraocular photoreception.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.840]   There's no way for light information
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.380]   to get to all the cells of your body.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.380]   But every cell in your body needs to know
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.040]   if it's night or day.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.940]   I talked a little bit about this in the episodes on sleep,
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.600]   and this episode is not about sleep,
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.440]   but I want to emphasize that there is a particular category
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.660]   of retinal ganglion cell.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.780]   Remember the neurons that connect the retina to the brain
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.980]   that is involved in a special kind of vision
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.000]   that has nothing to do with conscious perception
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.220]   of what's around you.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.740]   And it's happening right now.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.560]   It's happening all the time.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.120]   These are so-called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.220]   named after the opsin that they contain within them.
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.120]   They are essentially photoreceptors.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.760]   Remember before I said there are photoreceptors
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.740]   and then these ganglion cells?
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.000]   Well, these melanopsin cells, as the name suggests,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.080]   melanopsin, have their own photoreceptor built inside them.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.500]   The opsin that they contain is actually very similar
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.180]   to the melanopsin that is present in the skin
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.940]   of some amphibians,
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.420]   and that causes those amphibians to change their skin color
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.720]   in different light conditions.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.820]   So you have, believe it or not,
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.820]   a little bit of frog skin in your eye, so to speak.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.660]   Okay, not exactly, but you essentially have the equivalent
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.740]   of what frogs have in their skin in your eye.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.980]   If you are low vision or no vision,
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.800]   as long as you have retinas,
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.040]   it's very likely you still have these cells,
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.380]   even though you can't see or you don't see well.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.440]   These cells, retinal ganglion cells,
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.160]   communicate to areas of the brain
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.640]   when particular qualities of light
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.140]   are present in your environment
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:57.260]   and signal to the brain, therefore,
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.480]   that it's early day or late in the day.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.080]   These melanopsin ganglion cells
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.840]   are sometimes also called intrinsically photosensitive cells
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.500]   because they behave like photoreceptors.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.100]   What do these cells respond to
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.460]   and why should you care about them?
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.700]   Well, you should care about them
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.700]   because they regulate when you'll get sleepy,
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.060]   when you'll feel awake,
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.240]   how fast your metabolism is, excuse me,
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.520]   your blood sugar levels, your dopamine levels,
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.460]   and your pain threshold.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.300]   There are other factors that impact those things,
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.380]   but they are one of the, if not the most powerful,
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.860]   determinant of those other things,
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.140]   like mood and pain threshold,
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.440]   sleepiness, wakefulness, et cetera.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.820]   These melanopsin ganglion cells
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:44.820]   have been shown by the Knights Group, N-E-I-T-Z,
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.340]   up at the University of Washington
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.740]   and by Samir Hatar's lab and David Berson's lab
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.280]   and a number of other people's labs,
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.360]   Sachin Panda, Iggy Provencio, et cetera,
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.620]   a number of excellent labs in neuroscience
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.460]   to set the circadian clock and to respond best
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:07.340]   to the contrast between blue and yellow light of the sort
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:12.140]   that lands on these cells when you view the sun
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.060]   when it's at so-called low solar angle,
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.300]   when it's low in the sky,
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.180]   either in the morning or in the evening.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.360]   What does all this mean?
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.520]   It means, and here's the first protocol,
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.900]   and you've probably heard me say this before,
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.600]   but it is appropriate to this episode to say it again.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:32.300]   If you are not viewing the sun, sunlight,
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.100]   even through cloud cover for two to 10 minutes
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.380]   in the early part of the day
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.620]   when the sun is still low in the sky
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.220]   and doing the same thing again in the evening,
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.820]   you are severely disrupting your sleep rhythms,
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.140]   your mood, your hormones, your metabolism,
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.620]   your pain threshold, and many other factors,
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.760]   including your ability to learn and remember information.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.460]   The most central and important aspect of our biology
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.420]   and perhaps our psychology as well
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:04.600]   is to anchor ourselves in time,
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.360]   to know when we exist, okay?
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.720]   It sounds a little bit abstract and philosophical,
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.560]   but it's not.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:15.520]   And we don't know time as a real thing
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.740]   because of watches and clocks.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.360]   We know time at a biological level
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.320]   based on where the sun is and where,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.240]   which of course is where we are relative to the sun
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.800]   because the earth is spinning around.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.300]   Now, what does this mean for a protocol?
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.620]   It means see, get that light in your eyes early in the day
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.140]   and anytime you want to be awake.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.840]   So try and get as much sunlight in your eyes
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.160]   during the day as you safely can.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.260]   We'll talk about eye safety this episode in depth.
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.820]   And the blue light and the contrast of that blue yellow.
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.380]   Remember, we don't see blue.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.900]   This is all subconscious.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.100]   This is blue reflections coming off of sunlight.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.120]   Blue light, we've been told is so terrible for us.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.800]   It is absolutely essential and wonderful
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.280]   for waking up the brain,
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.300]   for triggering all sorts of positive biological reactions,
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.620]   but it needs to be viewed early in the day.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.940]   If you can't see sunlight because it's the thick cloud cover
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.380]   of say, you're in the UK and it's winter,
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.620]   then artificial lights, especially blue lights,
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.540]   would be very beneficial to you.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.920]   You need a lot of this light and its contrast with yellow
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.180]   in order to trigger these melanopsin cells,
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.540]   which would then trigger your circadian clock,
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.700]   which sits above the roof of your mouth,
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.780]   which will signal every cell in your body,
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.060]   including temperature rhythms, et cetera.
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.420]   So first things first,
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:33.420]   your visual system was not for seeing faces, motion, et cetera.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.060]   The most ancient cells in your eye,
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.920]   which are there right now as we speak,
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   are there to inform your body and brain about time of day.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.540]   So you want to get that bright light early in the day.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.100]   Absolutely essential, two to 10 minutes.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.100]   You can download the light meter app
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.700]   if you want to measure lux.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.220]   When I explained how to do that in earlier episodes,
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.060]   it got a little convoluted.
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.060]   Get that two to 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.460]   Now, here's another reason to do this,
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.700]   and I've never spoken about this before on any podcast,
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.460]   which is that there have been several studies now
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.980]   in thousands of subjects exploring what can be done
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.980]   to prevent myopia, nearsightedness, and other visual defects.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:22.480]   And it turns out in a series of large clinical trials,
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.000]   the conclusion has emerged that getting two hours a day
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.360]   of outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light,
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.920]   this blue light that everyone has demonized,
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.340]   getting that sunlight during the day for two hours,
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.960]   even if you're reading other things
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.920]   and doing other things outside,
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.560]   has a significant effect on reducing the probability
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.480]   that you will get myopia, nearsightedness.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.780]   Now, whether or not that's also due to the fact
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.840]   that myopia can be caused by viewing things
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.500]   up close too much, so if you're indoors,
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.300]   we tend to be looking at things more closely, right,
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.700]   unless you have a very large house
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.860]   with walls that are very far away from you.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:04.760]   But the effect does seem to be directly related
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.360]   to getting sunlight and not just to the distance
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.720]   that you're viewing.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.680]   I'm going to describe this study just briefly,
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.980]   but this is a second protocol.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.660]   So we have one protocol about getting sunlight
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.680]   to set your circadian clocks, meaning wake you up,
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.520]   establish your sleep will occur about 12 to 16 hours later.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.640]   That's all in the sleep episode,
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.800]   but also to enhance your mood, to enhance your metabolism,
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.920]   to optimize your hormone levels,
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.960]   and to optimize learning and dopamine levels,
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.660]   this feel-good neuromodulator that's essential
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.780]   to not getting depressed, et cetera.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.680]   But now's a second protocol, which is ideally,
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.860]   and this includes children,
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.540]   as long as they're not very small infants,
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.880]   ideally, we're all getting two hours of outdoor time,
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.660]   even if there's cloud cover.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.980]   Remember, we evolved mostly under outdoor conditions,
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.240]   not indoor conditions, and no artificial blue light
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:59.600]   will not replace this aspect of your visual system
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.460]   and offsetting myopia.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.240]   So I just want to briefly describe this study
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.440]   because it's a very important one
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.020]   and I don't think it's discussed often enough.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.520]   There are many studies exploring this,
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   but one of the ones I like the most looked at 693 students
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.780]   and a subset of them were encouraged
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:21.080]   to spend 11 hours a week outdoors, okay?
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.500]   So most kids are in school five days a week or so,
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.060]   so they're spending 11 hours a week outdoors.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.400]   They are sometimes reading outdoors.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.800]   They're not always just playing outdoors.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.000]   They might be reading books, et cetera.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.320]   They used eight different schools,
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.620]   and the reason they did this study,
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.520]   I probably should have mentioned,
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.520]   is that myopia, nearsightedness, is a global epidemic.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.820]   At least that's how it was referred to in the study.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.020]   I don't know who decides what's an epidemic or not.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.920]   I think there are thresholds for that.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:53.940]   This paper published in the journal Ophthalmology in 2018
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:58.580]   described the fact that being outdoors for two hours a day
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.340]   could significantly reduce the probability
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.580]   that these children would develop nearsightedness.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.020]   And it turns out, based on other studies,
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.460]   that adults who spend two hours a day outside,
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.380]   so that would be reading outside, talking outside,
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.140]   no, it does not include light coming
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.620]   through the windshield of your car.
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.360]   I'll explain why in a few moments.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:23.540]   Offset the formation of myopia.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.860]   Now, myopia or nearsightedness has to do
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   with the way that the lens focuses light onto the retina.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.540]   I don't want to get into a long description of this now,
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.100]   but basically the lens has to bring light to the retina,
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.500]   not in front of it, not behind it.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.220]   If it brings light to a position in front of the retina,
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.740]   then you won't see clearly.
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.020]   You will need corrective lenses.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.900]   If it brings light directly to the retina,
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.180]   then you will see clearly.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   That should be intuitive why that makes sense.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.300]   So you might say, why would being outside,
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.660]   getting this blue light or this blue-yellow contrast
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.540]   from sunlight actually offset myopia?
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.700]   Well, it probably, and I want to emphasize probably,
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.340]   has to do with the fact that these melanopsin ganglion cells,
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.120]   these intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.080]   are not just responsible for sleep
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.620]   and talking to your circadian clock,
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.720]   and that sort of thing.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.340]   They also make connections within the retina.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.420]   They connect to things like, this is for the aficionados,
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.420]   the ciliary body, the iris, the muscles,
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.760]   and the structures within the eye
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.180]   that actually move the lens and allow you
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:34.220]   to adjust your vision to things up close or far away.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.980]   And in doing so, they increase or improve the health
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.820]   of the little tiny muscles within the eye
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.860]   that move the lens.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.620]   And they probably, again, this needs a little bit more work
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.720]   in order to really tamp down the mechanism.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.700]   They're probably also involved in bringing growth factors
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:57.540]   and blood supply to the muscles and to the neurons
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:01.620]   that are responsible for this focusing mechanism
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.780]   within the eye.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.620]   So remember, your eye is an optical device.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.660]   You were born with lenses.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.360]   You don't have to use glasses, or maybe you do,
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.300]   because you have lenses in your eyes.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.780]   And those lenses need to move.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.440]   It's not a rigid lens like a glass lens.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.940]   It's a dynamic lens.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.620]   It has little muscles that pull on it and squeeze it
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.420]   and make it thicker or thinner
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.260]   as you look at things close and far away.
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.220]   And I'll describe how that works in a moment.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:30.100]   These melanopsin cells and their activation by sunlight,
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.500]   completely subconsciously, unaware, you're unaware of this,
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.180]   promote the health of this system within the eye
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.980]   and allow you to offset myopia, nearsightedness.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.220]   In other words, getting outside for two hours a day,
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.560]   each day, on average, even if there's cloud cover,
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.060]   without sunglasses on, will allow you
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.660]   to offset the formation of myopia.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.500]   Now, you might still form myopia
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.180]   if you have certain structural features
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.340]   or genetic basis for that.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.540]   We will talk about things that you can do as well.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.820]   But for everybody, we should be doing this.
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.220]   And that might seem like a lot,
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.620]   but this is the way that your visual system works.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.080]   Staying indoors, just getting artificial light,
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.700]   and looking at things up close, leads to visual defects.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.820]   It's a form of kind of like visual obesity.
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.580]   The posture of your visual system, if you will,
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.080]   is going to be unhealthy if you're just indoors
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.240]   and you're not getting sunlight early in the day
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.740]   and for at least two hours per day.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.820]   I want to talk a little bit more about how our eyes adjust
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.180]   to things that are close to us or far away.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.220]   This is an absolutely brilliant consequence
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.660]   of our nature and our design.
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.640]   And whenever I say nature and design,
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.420]   people always ask me, "What are you really trying to say?
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.920]   Are you trying to talk about creators?
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.400]   Are you talking about intelligent design?"
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.700]   Look, I want to be very frank with you.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.980]   I wasn't consulted at the design phase and neither were you.
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.120]   And so that is all very interesting,
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.220]   but it's not the topic of this discussion.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.620]   What is clear and what is the topic of this discussion
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:10.620]   is that the eye can dynamically adjust where light lands
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.200]   by moving the lens and changing the shape of the lens
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.740]   in your eye through a process called accommodation.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.780]   And if you understand this process of accommodation,
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.860]   you not only can enhance the health of your eyes
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.780]   in the immediate and long-term,
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.800]   but you also can work better.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.900]   You'll be able to focus better on physical and mental work.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.820]   You will be able to concentrate for longer.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.980]   And I want to emphasize that so much of our mental focus,
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.800]   whether or not it's for cognitive endeavors
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.140]   or physical endeavors is grounded
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.180]   in where we place our visual focus, okay?
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.960]   What we look at and our ability
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.900]   to hold our concentration there
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.780]   is critically determining how we think.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.900]   So in other words, if you can hold visual focus,
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.500]   you can hold mental focus, cognitive focus,
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.780]   but holding visual focus is challenging.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:06.780]   It's tiring because it requires movement of the lens.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:10.180]   And that movement of the lens requires activation of muscles
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.380]   and the activation of muscles,
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.900]   as you know from the physical performance episodes,
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.460]   if you saw them and even if you don't,
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.520]   is dictated by neurons.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.180]   So what is accommodation?
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:24.160]   Well, it's actually very simple and very elegant.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.880]   And again, this is another case
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.520]   where whenever I look at this stuff,
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.160]   even though I've been looking at it for years,
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.280]   learning about it for years,
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.860]   it still boggles my mind that we have these apparati
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.700]   built into our eyes.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.400]   So we have lenses in our eyes
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.700]   and we have these things called the irises.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.980]   You're all familiar with the iris
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.100]   because you'll see people's pupils get bigger or smaller.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.960]   And we intuitively think of eyes as having the pupils.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.080]   If you actually draw two circles on a sheet of paper
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.920]   and they look like two circles,
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.760]   but if you put little dots in the middle of them,
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.940]   they look like eyes.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.780]   Your brain recognizes those as eyes
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.080]   because one of the first things you see
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.960]   when you come into this world are eyes.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.520]   And actually if you put the little dots close together,
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.760]   it'll look kind of wrong, like it's cross-eyed.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.160]   And if you put them at different locations
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.040]   within those two dots, opposing locations,
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.080]   it'll look Google-eyed.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.160]   And so your brain is actually filling in all the face
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.820]   and other information, even emotional information,
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.360]   just based on this recognition of eyes.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.600]   And so there's clearly, we know this,
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.720]   there's real estate further up in the brain
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.340]   that's responsible for analyzing and recognizing faces
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.640]   and the eyes and the position of these little things
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.860]   we call irises and pupils, et cetera,
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.900]   is really important for how we interpret
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.480]   the status of others.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.980]   And that's why it's such a powerful thing
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:45.680]   just to put two circles and move the pupils around on paper.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.960]   In fact, I want to get into a combination,
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.220]   but if you think about it,
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.900]   if one of my pupils was up there
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:51.940]   and the other one was down there,
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.600]   one was really big and one was really small,
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.940]   that would actually be a sign of pretty severe damage.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.060]   If someone gets hit hard on the side of the head,
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.840]   you'll notice that they shine a light in one eye.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.760]   You know why they're doing that?
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.360]   They're actually looking at the other eye.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.400]   When you shine light of the eye,
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.800]   that pupil constricts to limit the amount of light
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.640]   that comes in so it doesn't damage the eye.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.780]   This also happens when you walk outside and it's bright.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.440]   It constricts,
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.120]   but we have what's called the consensual pupil reflex.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.060]   There's a connection deep in the brainstem,
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.460]   deep back here in the brain near my neck,
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:24.000]   that connects the pupil mechanism for the two eyes
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.040]   and they're looking at the other eye.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.020]   And if you shine light in one eye
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.120]   and that pupil constricts but the other one doesn't,
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.580]   there's a good chance there's brainstem damage.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.020]   This is what they do on the side of a football field
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.100]   or a boxing match
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.760]   or if someone unfortunately hits their head.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.700]   So two pupils and don't freak out
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.440]   if one pupil is a little bit smaller than the other,
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.980]   that doesn't necessarily mean brain damage.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.860]   But if you suddenly have one pupil bigger than the other,
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.820]   you absolutely want to go see a neurologist right away.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.600]   So the eyes and the pupils are indicative of things
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.780]   that are happening deep in the brain.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.540]   Now, accommodation is our ability to accommodate
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.060]   to things that are up close here or further away.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:06.020]   And the way this works is that the iris and the musculature
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.620]   and a structure called the ciliary body move the lens.
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.740]   So when you look far away,
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.280]   okay, when you see things far away,
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.280]   your lens actually relaxes.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.900]   It can flatten out.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:18.740]   So I want you to think about this.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.380]   When you look far away,
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.720]   when it may be anywhere from like 20 feet away from you
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:27.940]   out to a horizon that's miles or kilometers away from you,
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.420]   the lens can just relax.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.960]   It can flatten out.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.260]   And you'll notice that it actually is relaxing
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.060]   to look at a horizon.
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.820]   It's relaxing to look far away.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.940]   Whereas if I look at something up close to me,
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.660]   like this pen or my phone or a computer screen
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.820]   or this microphone, it takes effort.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.460]   You'll sense the effort.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.660]   Now, some of that effort is actually eye movements
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.340]   because you have muscles that can move your eyes
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.140]   within their sockets.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.640]   But a lot of the work, quote unquote, is neural work
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:59.280]   of the muscles having to move and contract
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.400]   such that the lens actually gets thicker
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.500]   in order to bring the light to the retina
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.220]   and not to a location in front of it or behind it,
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.240]   so-called accommodation.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.300]   There's also changes in the size of the pupil
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.760]   as things are closer and further away from you.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:18.320]   In fact, there's a simple way to think about this.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.920]   Healthy pupils are going to dilate
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.520]   when you look at something far away from you.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.600]   Now, when you see something that excites you
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.200]   or stresses you out, your pupils also get big.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.280]   Your eyes get wide.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.460]   But if you look at something far away,
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.680]   your pupils are going to dilate.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.140]   And when you look at things that are closer to you,
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.560]   when you move them up close to the pupils
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.600]   are going to shrink.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.520]   That's all part of this accommodation mechanism.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.960]   Now, you might say,
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.560]   why are you telling me about accommodation?
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.400]   This is crazy.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.240]   Why are you telling me about this?
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.700]   Well, these days, we're spending a lot of time
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.960]   looking at things, mainly our phones up close
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.760]   and computers up close, and we are indoors.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.880]   If you are a young person,
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.800]   and even if you are 25 or older,
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.480]   and you are spending a lot of time
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.280]   looking at things up close,
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.160]   and you are not allowing your vision to relax,
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.440]   in other words, you are not giving your lens
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.820]   the opportunity to flatten out
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:15.040]   and for these muscles to relieve themselves of this work,
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.760]   you may or may not have migraine headaches.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.760]   You may or may not have headaches.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.600]   You might, and that could be the cause of those.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:27.080]   But you are also training your eyes
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:32.840]   to be good at looking at things up close and not far away.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.920]   And as a consequence,
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.200]   you are reshaping the neural circuitry in your brain,
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.880]   and it is not good, it is not healthy,
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.640]   to only look at things up close.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.800]   Now, there are a lot of recommendations out there right now,
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.560]   especially with all the lockdowns of the last 12 to 18 months
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.580]   that people should look up from Zoom every once in a while,
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.700]   or maybe now I'm hearing that people should take calls
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.000]   instead of doing Zoom,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.580]   or you should look up from your computer screen.
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:59.680]   It's actually not going to solve the problem
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.620]   just to look up from your computer screen.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:02.860]   You need to go to a window,
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.400]   you need to look out at a distance.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.120]   Ideally, you would even open the window
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.480]   because those windows actually filter out
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.400]   a lot of the blue light that you want during the daytime,
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.520]   a lot of the sunlight.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.100]   It's actually 50 times less gets through.
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.440]   You want to get out onto a balcony.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.540]   You want to relax your eyes and look out at the horizon.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.400]   You want to go into what's called panoramic vision
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.000]   and let your vision expand.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.280]   You want this lens mechanism to be very elastic.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.200]   You don't want it to get stuck in that configuration
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.300]   of looking at things up close.
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.260]   Accommodation is a wonderful feature of your visual system,
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.160]   but you don't want to push that too hard,
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.620]   too often or for too long.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:44.000]   You want to view the horizon.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.320]   You want to get outside,
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.720]   not just to lighten the load on your mind
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.980]   or to think about other things,
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:53.440]   but to maintain the health of your visual system.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:58.760]   In other words, you want to exercise these muscles
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.140]   and that involves both the lens moving
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.640]   and getting kind of thicker and relaxing that lens.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.920]   And the relaxation of the lens
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.560]   is actually one of the best things you can do
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.920]   for the musculature of the inner eye.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.800]   So what's the protocol?
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.920]   How often should you do this?
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.820]   You might be surprised,
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.060]   but for every 30 minutes of focused work,
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.200]   you probably want to look up every once in a while
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   and just try and relax your face and eye muscles,
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.420]   including your jaw muscles,
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.360]   because all these things are closely linked
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.900]   in the brainstem and allow your eyes
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.580]   to go into so-called panoramic vision
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.320]   where you're just not really focusing on anything
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.800]   and then refocus on your work.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   At least every 90 minutes of looking at things up close
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.840]   or even if you're looking at a television screen
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.040]   or you're watching a movie or you're indoors,
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.140]   for every 90 minutes of that,
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:53.480]   you ideally would have at least 20,
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:57.380]   probably more like 30 minutes of being outside ideally,
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:02.040]   but if you can't be outside, of non up close vision.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.140]   Now you might say, "That's impossible.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.440]   "How am I supposed to do that?
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.940]   "I'm in an office or I'm in a building."
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.520]   Get to a window, get outside if you can do it safely,
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:13.900]   get onto a balcony and just let your eyes relax.
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:17.020]   Many people are experiencing severe vision problems
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.160]   because they're not getting enough sunlight during the day.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.360]   They have sleep problems
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.640]   because they're not viewing sunlight early in the day.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.840]   And as I've mentioned in previous episodes,
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.140]   they're getting a lot of artificial stimulation,
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.680]   artificial light stimulation of the eye
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.760]   in the middle of the night.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.880]   All of this is through the visual system.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:40.880]   So migraines, fatigue, challenges with your eyesight
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.120]   getting worse as you age or even in young people,
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.520]   there's at least according to the articles,
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.480]   they described it as this epidemic of myopia
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.460]   can largely be dealt with by getting outside,
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.280]   going into panoramic vision,
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.800]   experiencing some distance division,
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.000]   look at things off on the horizon.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.940]   If you're walking or hiking or biking,
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.500]   not looking at your phone the whole time
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:03.600]   that you're doing that.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.240]   If you're at the bus stop or you're commuting,
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.940]   certainly not looking at your phone
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.200]   the entire time you're doing that.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.480]   So this is vital.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.720]   And I want to emphasize another protocol,
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.320]   although I don't want to get into it in too much depth
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.500]   'cause I want to make sure that I also talk about
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.500]   a number of other important aspects of the visual system
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.320]   that are more related to sight.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.920]   But getting into optic flow is very important
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.220]   for de-stressing your system.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.720]   When you move through space,
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:34.560]   whether or not it's through walking, biking, even swimming,
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.480]   if it's self-generated optic flow,
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.080]   so probably not driving or motorcycling,
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.800]   but yes, bicycling or I don't know, unicycling.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.960]   I don't know why I thought about unicycling.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.260]   There used to be a graduate student at Stanford
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.640]   who was a really impressive unicycler.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.740]   Those are pretty rare.
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.920]   As long as it's self-generated optic flow,
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.520]   meaning you're generating motion of your body
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:58.800]   and the visual images around you are passing by on your eyes
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.900]   that is very good for the visual system.
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.960]   And it's very good for the mood systems
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.080]   and the neuromodulator systems of the brain and body
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.280]   that regulate mood.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.200]   This is well-established.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.280]   So I'm not telling people to get away
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.400]   from their phone and their computers.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.640]   I spend a lot of time staring at a page,
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.520]   drawing, writing, texting, et cetera, just like you do.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:20.040]   But we're really talking about some very simple protocols
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.200]   that aren't just designed to improve your sleep
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:26.200]   but are really designed to bolster and enhance your vision.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.980]   And of course, because it's this podcast,
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.120]   we will also talk about things that you can take
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.000]   to improve your vision.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.120]   But if your visual behavior isn't right,
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.320]   and I do believe we should always start with behaviors
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.880]   and then think about nutrition, supplementation, et cetera.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.120]   If your behaviors around vision aren't right,
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.240]   you cannot expect to have good healthy eyesight
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.560]   for a long time, meaning throughout your lifespan.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.360]   And if your vision is already poor,
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.820]   many of these things that I'm talking about today,
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:56.480]   perhaps all of them will improve your vision to some degree.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.020]   And if your vision is starting to go,
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:02.500]   then doing these behaviors is likely to really enhance
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.920]   the quality of the vision that you will build
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.620]   and maintain over time.
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.780]   And all of these are essentially zero cost, okay?
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.740]   If you live in a very dark environment,
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.740]   like a cave or outer space,
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.520]   it's going to be hard to do some of this stuff.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.580]   But if you're on planet earth, even if there's cloud cover,
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.020]   chances are you can do some or most, or even all of these,
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:26.060]   some, most, or all days.
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:29.280]   What I'm about to describe next is going to seem so silly
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.120]   on the face of it, but has deep mechanism to support it.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:37.900]   Put simply, when you get tired, your eyelids close.
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:41.300]   And when you're alert, your eyelids are open.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:46.440]   That is because you have neurons in your brain
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.080]   that depending on your level of alertness
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:52.160]   will make it easy or hard to keep your eyes open.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:55.200]   Now that's a complete duh,
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.300]   except that we don't often think about the relationship
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.400]   between alertness and where we are looking and our eyelids.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.240]   Now, I learned this from a colleague of mine in psychiatry
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.480]   who happens to work on hypnosis.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.920]   I'm not going to hypnotize you right now.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.320]   That's actually for a future episode.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.520]   But what happens when we get tired?
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.140]   Our eyelids close and our chin moves down.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.060]   We tend to nod out this way.
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:22.880]   If you have ever been in a classroom,
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.040]   certainly not one of mine,
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.900]   but if you've been in a classroom
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:29.680]   and the lecture is kind of drawing on or it's the afternoon,
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.200]   what you'll notice is that a number of students,
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:35.320]   their heads are kind of, their eyelids are closing
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.480]   and their chin is dropping,
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.160]   and then you'll see a bunch of heads bouncing back up.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.560]   I was definitely one of those people in class.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:44.660]   If it was post-lunch in the afternoon, it's warm,
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.400]   the hum of the air conditioner or whatever it is,
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.220]   and I just out, okay?
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:53.340]   When we're wide awake, the opposite happens.
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.440]   Our eyelids are open all the way
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.360]   and our chin happens to be up.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:01.260]   And no, this is not me telling you to have good posture.
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:04.720]   However, what I learned from my colleague at Stanford
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:08.580]   is that these circuits actually act in loops.
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.880]   When we look up,
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.640]   maybe it's because these melanopsin cells
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.660]   are in the bottom of our retina, they are,
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.220]   and maybe it's because they're there
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:21.720]   in order to view sunlight, which is overhead, which it is,
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.380]   but that system of alertness
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.580]   is linked to the position of our eyes.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.520]   So when we look up and our eyelids are up,
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:31.520]   it actually has a purpose.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.760]   It actually creates a wakefulness signal for the brain.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.900]   And so while this might seem like the silliest
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:41.260]   and simple tool that I might ever describe on this podcast,
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.060]   if you are feeling tired,
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.840]   it actually can be beneficial
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.520]   to the wakefulness systems of the brain,
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.900]   including the locus coeruleus
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.020]   and these areas that release norepinephrine
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:54.620]   to actually look up, to actually look up toward the ceiling.
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.380]   You don't want your chin all the way back,
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.500]   but to look up and to raise your eyes toward the ceiling
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.940]   and to look up and try and hold that for 10 to 15 seconds.
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.760]   So this isn't looking up and closing your eyes
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:07.120]   like on a nice sunny day, that's relaxing.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:11.120]   This is looking up and actually looking up at the ceiling.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.680]   It actually triggers some of the areas of the brain
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.400]   that are involved in wakefulness.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.220]   So if you're somebody who's falling asleep at your work,
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:20.220]   this can be very beneficial.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:25.220]   Likewise, many people are looking at their phone all day
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:28.380]   and their chin is down,
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.860]   and then they're sitting at a computer
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.000]   that's positioned below them
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.980]   and they're having trouble staying awake or focusing.
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:36.140]   It can be very, I tell Costello this all the time
[00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:37.140]   'cause he's always falling asleep
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.380]   while he's trying to do his work.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:42.880]   Positioning your computer screen up at eye level,
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.380]   or sometimes having it actually above eye level
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:49.100]   can actually create wakefulness and alertness
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:50.400]   for the work that you're going to do.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.220]   This is simply because of this connection
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.920]   between the brainstem circuits and the other neural circuits
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:00.920]   that control wakefulness and eyelids opening and looking up.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:04.500]   Okay, so again, it's remarkably simple,
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:05.680]   almost laughably simple,
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.600]   but it's grounded in some of the most hardwired,
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:12.140]   meaning present from birth aspects of our neural circuitry.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.480]   And norepinephrine released from locus coeruleus
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.940]   isn't just a mouthful.
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:20.980]   It's a really interesting and powerful mechanism
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.620]   for how the rest of the brain wakes up.
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.260]   Locus coeruleus hoses the rest of your brain
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.980]   with norepinephrine in order to wake up those circuits
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:30.220]   for work and attention.
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:34.200]   And so eyes up is actually a way,
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.560]   a route into increased alertness.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.500]   Eyes down is a route into sleepiness,
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.520]   into reduced alertness.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:45.320]   And I have only one friend that texts up here,
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.480]   like on the street, holds his phone up here.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.000]   It looks ridiculous.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   And yet, if we were trying to create more sense of alertness,
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.300]   if that's your goal,
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:58.520]   positioning computer screens up high, chin up,
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.400]   looking up if you need to kind of create
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.280]   an alertness signal,
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.600]   not always being chinned down and texting
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.760]   or working into typewriters or reading below us,
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.400]   is actually going to send a recurring wakefulness signal.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.820]   When things are up, we tend to be alert.
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:14.160]   When everything's focused down, including our eyes,
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.680]   it tends to have a more suppressive
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.440]   or sedative type signaling
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.140]   to the deeper centers of the brain.
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:22.120]   Now, before we move on to the science and tools
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.660]   and protocols related to pattern vision,
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.060]   I want to mention another study
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:28.420]   that was done by the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:31.700]   They have a terrific group there that works on sleep
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.380]   that made an important discovery
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:35.780]   that I think everybody should know about,
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:39.920]   which is that children that sleep in rooms
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:43.500]   that have a nightlight or dim lights
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:47.540]   are much more likely to develop myopia, nearsightedness.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:53.080]   Conversely, children that sleep in very dark rooms,
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:57.600]   so either very dim nightlights or a complete black,
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.420]   they have a much lower, statistically speaking,
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.160]   a significantly lower probability
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.120]   of developing myopia, nearsightedness.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.960]   Now, why is that?
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.400]   It's because the wavelengths of light that matter
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.120]   for these melanopsin cells
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.600]   oftentimes can get through the eyelids.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.880]   And that's particularly true
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.760]   for children and people that have thin eyelids.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.360]   Some people, like me, have very thin eyelids.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.940]   I've been told this before.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.140]   Not many people touch my eyelids,
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.520]   but among those that have, they have very thin eyelids.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.780]   I notice I have very thin eyelids compared to, say, Costello.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.200]   Now, Costello's eyes droop.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.580]   He can't even close his eyes all the way.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.620]   They're so droopy.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.620]   But many people have thin eyelids,
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.660]   and those people are going to be even more prone
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:48.240]   to light coming in through the eyelid.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.540]   So for parents, for kids, and for adults,
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.940]   you really want to try to get to a place
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.380]   where you can sleep in a completely black
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.940]   or dark environment.
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:00.900]   One little exposure to light, no big deal.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.600]   But this ties back to the other protocol
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.420]   that I've described before in the mood and sleep episodes,
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.260]   which is that viewing light, even a very low intensity,
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.420]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.460]   it's extremely detrimental to the dopamine
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:17.140]   and other mood-producing systems of the brain.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.700]   It can negatively impact learning and immunity
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.360]   and even blood sugar and make people type 2 diabetes prone
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.120]   by way of communication from these melanopsin cells
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.660]   to a structure in the brain called the habenula.
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.500]   Why am I throwing out all this verbiage?
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.420]   Well, because people have asked for more mechanisms.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.200]   So if you really want to know when you look at blue light
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.980]   or if blue light is getting in through your eyelids
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.280]   in the middle of the night,
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.940]   it is likely distorting these lens accommodation mechanism
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:47.220]   in the eye and leading to myopia in some cases.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.640]   So that's one reason to avoid blue light exposure
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.480]   and bright light exposure,
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.720]   even nightlight exposure in the middle of the night.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.320]   Viewing any light of bright intensity
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.000]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   on a consistent basis is going to suppress dopamine
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.640]   because of the way that that light
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.120]   activates these melanopsin cells
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.720]   and the habenula and the dopamine system.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.640]   So it's all very simple.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.240]   Get as much bright light as you can safely, right?
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.760]   You never want to look at any light so bright
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.720]   that it's painful to look at during the daytime.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.920]   Try and go without sunglasses unless you need them.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.080]   Now I wear sunglasses for sake of sport
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.140]   and sake of when it's really bright out,
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.200]   but I try to get two hours a day of working outside
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.820]   or being outside, even if there's cloud cover,
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.680]   that's going to offset myopia.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.280]   It's going to help you get better sleep.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   It's going to support mood and metabolism, et cetera.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.440]   And at night, if you're sleeping
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.520]   with a lot of lights in the room,
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.400]   and especially if there are kids that need a nightlight,
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.860]   you should try and wean them off that nightlight
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.040]   because it's going to be beneficial for their vision
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.260]   to wean them off that nightlight
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.220]   and put them into a darker environment.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:50.840]   Obviously you want to get them emotionally comfortable
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.440]   with that first.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.160]   Now let's talk about pattern vision,
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.000]   actual seeing things like faces and colors, et cetera.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.240]   I'm presuming that some of you out there are colorblind.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   We can all help the red-green colorblind folks out there.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.640]   By not using red in slides and diagrams
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.200]   and on menus and things of that sort,
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.000]   try and use magenta instead.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.440]   They can see the contrast between magenta and green better
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.960]   than if there's red and green.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.120]   So be kind to the colorblind folks out there.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.040]   It's actually a fair percentage.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.360]   And there are a lot of different kinds of colorblind.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.280]   I should just mention some people are true monochromats.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.660]   They see the world in black and white.
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.200]   That's exceedingly rare.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:35.120]   Most colorblind people, colorblind in quotes,
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.880]   are red-green colorblind,
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.640]   meaning they lack red-cone photopigment,
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.100]   meaning they can't see long wavelengths of light,
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.520]   so they see the world much as a canine or a cat does,
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.160]   where they don't get the green-red contrast.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.500]   That's why we call it red-green colorblind.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.960]   They have the green cones,
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.000]   but they can't do the contrast comparison
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.680]   that I described at the beginning of the episode.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.420]   So use magenta and they will be able to see things.
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.400]   You wonder why stop signs and stop lights
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.880]   and things aren't in magenta.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.360]   Well, because the world is unkind
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.760]   to the red-green colorblind individuals
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.080]   and they have to learn the position
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.360]   of those lights in the street lights
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.400]   and they have to learn the shapes of signs,
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.320]   which they can do readily
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.720]   and it usually says stop on it as well.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.600]   But if you care about colorblind folks, which I do,
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.960]   then we could all do them a service by,
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.600]   I think by law actually in the US,
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.320]   menus are required to be colorblind accessible.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.480]   How can you improve your vision?
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.980]   How can you get better at seeing things?
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:36.780]   Well, one way is to make sure that you spend
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.360]   at least 10 minutes a day total,
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.280]   at least, viewing things off in the distance.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.360]   So that would be well over half a mile or more.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.720]   Try and see a horizon.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.080]   Try and get your vision out to a location
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.000]   that's beyond the four walls of your house or apartment
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.660]   or the doors of your car and the windshield of your car.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.360]   I know that can be hard to do, but it's very valuable.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.940]   If you live in a city like New York
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.820]   and it's skyscrapers everywhere,
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.100]   you've probably experienced
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.700]   the incredible sense of relaxation.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.060]   And it's aesthetically beautiful
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.240]   when you are walking down one of these long avenues
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.560]   and you turn,
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.080]   and I think they have a name for this in New York,
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.560]   where the sunset is suddenly visible
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.320]   along a long avenue between some skyscrapers.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.640]   And it's just very relaxing to be able suddenly
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.700]   to see at a distance.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.880]   And that's actually because this eye mechanism
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:30.880]   relaxing the lens and relaxing some of the musculature
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.260]   around the eyes.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.020]   Send signals deep into the brainstem
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.420]   that release some of the centers
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:39.060]   that are involved in alertness, AKA stress.
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.880]   And it's very pleasant for a reason.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.240]   It's not a placebo effect, if you will.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.540]   There are a bunch of neurochemicals
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.300]   and things that are associated with that.
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.820]   So try and see at a distance
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.380]   because it's good for your eyesight.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:54.020]   It'll keep this lens nice and elastic
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.660]   and the muscles nice and strong that move the lens.
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:00.460]   And it has this relaxing component to it.
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:05.200]   Now, our visual system is exquisitely tuned to motion,
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.080]   not just our self-generated motion,
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.840]   but the motion of things around us.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.000]   And one of the things that it does
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.740]   is something called smooth pursuit.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:18.740]   Smooth pursuit is our ability to track individual objects,
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.480]   moving as the name suggests, smoothly through space
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.800]   in various trajectories.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:29.800]   You can actually train or improve your vision
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.980]   by looking at smooth pursuit stimuli.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.000]   And that sounds really boring.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.500]   What you can do is, and I'll provide a link
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.060]   to some that I think are pretty good
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:39.420]   that are used in various clinics,
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:42.360]   ophthalmology and optometry clinics.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.000]   You can actually take a few minutes each day,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.640]   or maybe if you don't do it each day,
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.880]   you could do every third day or so,
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.460]   and actually just visually track a ball.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.580]   Sometimes it's moving in and kind of an infinity symbol.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.880]   Sometimes it's more of a sawtooth.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.680]   Sometimes it's changing speed.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.780]   Sometimes the cue that you're following,
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:03.340]   the little target, is dilating and contracting.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.520]   This is going to keep the muscles, I want to be clear,
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.400]   this is going to keep the extra ocular muscles
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.200]   conditioned and strong,
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.460]   and allow you to have a healthy, smooth pursuit system.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.520]   Remember, the brain follows the eye.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.680]   It follows the movements of the eye.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.840]   It has to deal with that.
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.580]   And the neural circuits within the brain
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.560]   have to cope with changes in smooth pursuit.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.560]   So if you're doing a lot of reading up close,
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.680]   you're not viewing horizons,
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.720]   you're not getting a lot of smooth pursuit type stimulation
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.900]   from your life,
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.920]   or you're just getting it within the confines
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.320]   of a little box on your phone,
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.540]   like your smooth pursuit is over millimeters,
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:43.060]   or what we always talk in terms of visual angle,
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.880]   but the amount of degrees of visual angle.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.320]   But if you're just looking at smooth pursuit
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.020]   in this little tiny box on your phone
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.360]   or on your computer screen,
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.420]   and you're not looking at objects in your environment,
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.940]   like swooping birds and things like that,
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:53.920]   which I'm guessing many of you
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.560]   are not spending your time doing,
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.360]   well, these mechanisms for smooth pursuit
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.420]   will get worse over time.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:07:59.540]   Your vision will get worse.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:02.160]   And so while I prefer that people get out
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.080]   into the real world and experience
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.060]   smooth pursuit tracking of visual objects,
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.800]   and maybe it's a good reason to go to a hockey game
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.080]   or try and keep your eye on the puck,
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.880]   which I can never seem to do, move so fast.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.520]   Or I guess this is a good reason to watch live sports,
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.620]   if that's your thing,
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.880]   or watch a tennis match like a cat, like a kitten,
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.940]   watching the ball go back and forth.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:25.040]   Whatever, watching kids play, it doesn't really matter.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:29.960]   The idea is that you want to use the visual system regularly
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.020]   for what it was designed for,
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:35.120]   and smooth pursuit is a great way to keep the visual
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.420]   and motion tracking systems of the brain and the eye
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:38.820]   and the extraocular muscles
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:41.100]   working in a really nice coordinate fashion.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:46.100]   I would say five to 10 minutes, three times a week,
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.940]   will be great if you care about your vision,
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:50.180]   you can train your vision in this way.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:53.540]   The other one is to train accommodation.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.180]   There are a lot of videos out there,
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:57.000]   I want to be clear, on the internet,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.320]   some of which are from clinicians, some of which are not,
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.600]   some of which are from scientists,
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.580]   some of which are from other sources,
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:08.380]   talking about things you can do to make your vision better,
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.560]   to improve your vision.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.100]   Most of those are geared toward
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.420]   improving the extraocular eye muscles.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:18.120]   But I did consult with our chair of ophthalmology
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine, Jeff Goldberg,
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:23.780]   who's an MD and a PhD, a phenomenal scientist
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:25.620]   and a phenomenal clinician,
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.360]   and incidentally, a phenomenal chairman as well,
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:33.180]   about what sorts of things, tools are actually beneficial
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:35.180]   for pattern vision and sight,
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.440]   because there's just so much out there on the internet,
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:40.940]   not all of which is accurate or good, frankly.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.940]   And he agreed that a smooth pursuit stimulus,
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:47.920]   that kind of training, as well as, or exercise,
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.700]   as well as near far.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.280]   So spending a few minutes,
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.860]   you might even just do this for two minutes,
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.920]   of looking at something up close,
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.140]   that's going to activate these accommodation mechanisms,
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.240]   and then moving it at arm's length
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.940]   and focusing on it for five, 10 seconds, maybe more,
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:03.840]   maybe 15 or 20 seconds,
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.460]   then slowly moving it into a location and then out.
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.700]   This is actually a lot like the visual training
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:13.740]   that's done post-concussion to try and repair,
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.300]   actually repair some of the balance and motor
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:20.340]   and visual and cognitive aspects of the brain.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:23.100]   And we are going to have a guest on in a future time
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.580]   that to deal with concussion
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.560]   and some post-concussion training,
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.160]   a lot of post-concussion recovery and training centers
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.380]   around the visual system,
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:33.780]   not just because people are trying to recover their vision
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.540]   and their sense of balance,
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.300]   but because, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.460]   the brain's ability to make sense of its environment
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.840]   and the brain's ability to parse time,
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.800]   not just on the day/night schedule,
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.220]   but also shorter time intervals, follows the visual system,
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.140]   something we'll turn to a little bit more at the end.
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.060]   So what does this mean?
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:56.840]   The tool is spend two to three minutes doing smooth pursuit.
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.000]   There's some programs on YouTube.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.840]   You can just look up smooth pursuit stimulus,
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.220]   and I'll provide a link to a couple I like as well.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.600]   You could do this with a pen if you wanted.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.160]   You could do this, someone else could hold a wand,
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.000]   and you could do that
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.540]   if you've got someone that can do that for you.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.260]   Practice accommodation for a few minutes,
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.360]   maybe every other day, just bringing something in close.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.240]   You'll feel the strain of your eyes doing that.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.540]   I can feel it right now.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.980]   Move it out.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.520]   You'll feel a relaxation point.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.200]   Move it past that relaxation point
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.220]   where you will have to do what's called a virgin side movement
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:28.620]   to maintain focus on that location as it moves out.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:30.060]   Bring it back in.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:32.720]   At the point where you actually have to go cross-eyed,
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.940]   this will differ for different people
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.840]   depending on how far apart your eyes are,
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.540]   so-called interpupillary distance.
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.300]   So for me, I have been teased before.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.480]   I have a very short interpupillary distance.
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.300]   I'm not a cyclops, but I'm heading there.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.040]   Some people are more wall-eyed like a flounder.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.820]   Well, depending on your interpupillary distance,
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.740]   the point at which things get blurry and cross-eyed
[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:56.600]   will vary, but for me, you know, as I get about,
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:59.340]   oh my gosh, I guess it's about six inches from my nose,
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.420]   it's really hard, I can't accommodate any longer.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.980]   I move it out another inch and everything's in nice focus.
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.940]   Try and see whether or not you can get things closer.
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.300]   Now, you don't want to get cross-eyed.
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.020]   Remember what your parents told you,
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.220]   or my parents told me that if you cross your eyes
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.500]   when you're young, that they can stay that way.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.040]   Actually, they won't necessarily stay that way,
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.940]   but your brain can start losing information
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:21.820]   and the ability to see binocular depth,
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:22.960]   something we'll talk about in a moment.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.560]   But for now, the protocol would be two to three,
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.400]   maybe five minutes, just practice that,
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.400]   practice accommodation,
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.880]   and then be sure to give your eyes some rest.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.500]   Get outside, look at a horizon, or do nothing.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.280]   Just kind of let your eyes go soft.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.120]   Guess what the yogis would call soft gaze.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.760]   Just kind of relax your eyelids.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.020]   Not this, not eyes closed, just relax.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.060]   Panoramic vision, try and see the walls around you
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.900]   without moving your head.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.280]   Exercise your eye muscles,
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.940]   exercise the accommodation mechanisms of your eyes.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:53.160]   Practice a little bit of smooth pursuit.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.580]   You don't have to be neurotic about this,
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:56.240]   but if you do this often enough,
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.660]   meaning every other day, every third day or so,
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.280]   you can be the strange person on the plane
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.460]   or in the classroom doing this.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:06.360]   People might chuckle or look at you funny or tease you,
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.780]   but that's okay because you'll be able to see
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:11.040]   when they are losing their vision.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.000]   So you'll get the last laugh.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:13.920]   Please don't laugh at them,
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.420]   but maybe you can help them at that point.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:16.920]   You can hold the pen for them.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.280]   It's worth doing.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.200]   It's really worth preserving your vision.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.600]   And again, if you're a young person, this is great
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.920]   because then you can actually build
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.260]   an extra strong visual system
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.600]   using all the tools that we're describing.
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.160]   I do want to talk about a new set of findings
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.920]   that are related to red light
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.960]   and offsetting age-related macular degeneration.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.940]   There are a lot of ways in which our visual system
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:40.780]   gets worse over time,
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:44.020]   but one is so-called age-related macular degeneration.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.160]   Glenn Jeffrey at the University College London,
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.260]   somebody I've known for decades because he's a scientist,
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.020]   has done beautiful work on development
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:53.040]   and function of the visual system,
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.720]   has published a number of papers recently.
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:59.600]   One that got a particularly high amount of attention
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.520]   in the press was one that showed that flashing red light
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.360]   into the eyes early in the day, not late in the day,
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.240]   early in the day can help offset
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.180]   some age-related macular degeneration,
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.120]   presumably by enhancing the mitochondrial function
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.680]   in the photoreceptors.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.920]   There does seem to be some evidence for that,
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.480]   although it's still early days.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.760]   I want to emphasize you don't want to shine
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.200]   really bright lights into your eyes.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.620]   You never want to look at any light that's so bright
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:26.860]   that it's painful,
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.700]   and you never want to force your eyelids to stay open.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.980]   If you need to close your eyes in order to be comfortable,
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:33.380]   well, then chances are that light is too bright.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:35.540]   But doing just a couple minutes a day,
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:38.640]   like two minutes a day of flashing this red light
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.500]   into one eye and then the other,
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:44.420]   as long as it was early in the day before noontime,
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.080]   and as long as it was in individuals
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.860]   that were 40 years or older,
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.620]   did seem to have a significant effect
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.780]   in offsetting some of the age-related macular degeneration
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.580]   that would otherwise occur.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:56.860]   Again, these are early findings.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.180]   If you want to do this, please be careful.
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:02.600]   Please talk to your optometrist and/or ophthalmologist.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.620]   Your eyesight is precious, you don't want to damage it,
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.460]   but it is interesting, and it does seem like red light
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.280]   can improve the function of the mitochondria.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.820]   These photoreceptors have a lot of mitochondria,
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:14.540]   the energy-producing organelles within the cells,
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:17.720]   because they are some of the most metabolically active cells
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.940]   in your entire body.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.940]   Your photoreceptors are active all the time
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:21.780]   as you're looking around,
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.840]   and even when your eyes are closed, they're active.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.420]   In fact, through a weird twist of the biology,
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:29.080]   and please look this up if you're really interested in this,
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.540]   your photoreceptors are actually most active in the dark.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:33.380]   This is so weird.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:37.060]   It's a twist of biology, the way the system's arranged,
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:40.120]   that when light comes on, they shut off their activity.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.920]   So actually, whether or not you see something in front of you
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.220]   like this pen or my face is because
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:49.060]   the way your photoreceptors are turning off, not turning on,
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.240]   it's a really cool twist.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:53.540]   And I don't want to go too far down that rabbit hole,
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.100]   but check it out if you're interested
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.120]   in how photoreceptors work.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.000]   It's absolutely incredible literature.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.640]   Just Google, excuse me, look up on the web.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.980]   We are not partial just to Google.
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:06.020]   I happen to use Google, but use your web browser
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:10.260]   to look up a photoreceptors hyperpolarization site,
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.460]   and you can learn a lot about that
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:14.160]   if you're a real nerd for this stuff like I am.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.160]   Okay, so red light to the eye can perhaps, it seems,
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.740]   help maintain vision, doing smooth pursuit exercises,
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:25.340]   and accommodation near-far exercises.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:27.860]   Some people suffer from poor eyesight
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.760]   simply because their eyes get dry.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.940]   There are incredible, believe it or not,
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:34.380]   lubricating mechanisms for the eye,
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.220]   not just tears, but thin sheet of oil.
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:38.060]   I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.980]   Unless you have some sort of corneal abrasion,
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:42.700]   the cornea is the clear stuff on the outside of your eye,
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.960]   corneal abrasion, when you blink, it's smooth.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.220]   You don't feel it.
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:48.660]   It's just really, really smooth.
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.880]   And yet, if you've ever had a corneal scratch,
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.420]   I've had this, it's really rough.
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.060]   It is so painful.
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.580]   You have a ton of pain receptors in the cornea.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.780]   The lubrication of the cornea is supported by blinking.
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.060]   And while it seems a little silly,
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:09.940]   some people actually benefit from doing some,
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:12.380]   five or 10 or 15 seconds of blinking
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:15.020]   and then doing their focused work.
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.660]   Some people, their eyes are drying out because as we focus,
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:20.500]   if we're trying to do something, our eyelids stay open,
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.720]   the eyes can dry out, but it also can make it such
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.380]   that when we blink the next time,
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.900]   there's a kind of a need to focus
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.960]   because there's some distortions in these oils and liquids
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.020]   across the corneal surface.
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.640]   If you're somebody who suffers from dry eye,
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.140]   I do hope they'll find a treatment or a cure for dry eye
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:37.880]   soon, there isn't one at present.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:39.600]   Someone stands to make a lot of money out there
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.060]   if you can find a cure for dry eye,
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:44.980]   let the companies know or start a company.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:47.100]   Right now, it's still a mystery as to how to do that,
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:49.820]   but blinking for five to 15 seconds, probably slowly,
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.480]   not as quickly as I'm doing here on video,
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.120]   but just maybe a blink every second or two for 15 seconds
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.260]   can lubricate the eyes and that's not directly related
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.840]   to anything neural, it's just going to allow the optics
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.780]   of your eye to be clear, just like when the screen
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:05.060]   of your phone gets dirty, like when Costello is texting
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.960]   on my phone and I pick it up and it's like covered
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.580]   with smudge to clean it off in order to see things clearly,
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:12.060]   the same thing is happening for these optical devices
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.980]   on the front of your brain, remember, these are brain.
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:19.780]   Okay, so a lot of protocols today, almost all of them,
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:25.280]   behavioral protocols, I do want to talk a little bit more
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.640]   about vision and how it works internally
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.520]   and then I also want to talk about some of the foods
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.880]   and supplements that have been shown to support vision
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.400]   and offset visual loss
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.940]   and maybe even reverse some visual loss.
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:40.100]   Let's talk about binocular vision and lazy eye.
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:44.560]   I'm very familiar with lazy eye because when I was a kid,
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:48.240]   I went swimming one day, one day and I didn't have
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.600]   my goggles and so something must have been happening
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.880]   as I recall with the eye moving down through the water,
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.620]   I've always had this problem that I can only do
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.580]   the freestyle stroke off to one side,
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:00.240]   the people I swim with are always laughing,
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.880]   somehow I kind of move toward drowning when I try
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.000]   and breathe on the right side, I think there's some asymmetry
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.780]   in the way I'm organized, anyway, I was off to my left
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.240]   and my eye kept going in and out of the water
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.400]   and there was chlorine in the water
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.460]   and it was making my eye uncomfortable,
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:16.760]   so I just closed my eye, I just decided, you know,
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.840]   I knew more or less how to swim straight-ish,
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.640]   might have bounced off the lane lines a few times
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.240]   but I just used the other eye to kind of steer
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:26.520]   for that mark on the wall, got out of the pool,
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.280]   took a shower, dried off and then completely lost
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.240]   binocular vision for three days, completely.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:37.120]   The young brain up until about age seven
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.260]   but maybe even extending out until about age 12
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:45.180]   is extremely vulnerable to differences in ocular input
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:48.340]   between the two eyes, my scientific great grandparents
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:50.300]   won the Nobel Prize for discovering
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:52.220]   so-called critical periods, periods of time
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.500]   in which the brain is more plastic, more able to change,
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.900]   those two guys, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel,
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:00.440]   thank you David and Torsten, forever changed the face
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.820]   of visual neuroscience and forever changed the way
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:06.740]   we think about treatment of the young brain,
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:08.880]   it used to be thought that you wouldn't want to do a surgery
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.100]   on a young kid because of risk of anesthesia
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:15.020]   in young individuals but we now know that you need
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:18.980]   to repair these imbalances that even a few hours,
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.980]   okay, I don't want to scare anybody, I'll talk about reversal
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:24.520]   but a few hours of occluding one eye early in life
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.660]   can lead to permanent, unless something's done,
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:30.260]   permanent changes in the way that the brain perceives
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:32.500]   the outside world such that when that eye
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.420]   is opened up again, the brain actually can't make sense
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:36.380]   of anything that's coming through it,
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.580]   it shuts down that visual pathway somehow
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:41.260]   so what happened to me was I actually was,
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:43.820]   my eye was fine, I got out of the pool, I opened my eye
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.420]   but I couldn't see through that eye,
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.200]   everything was blurry, double vision unless I covered
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.780]   this eye and then I could see perfectly fine.
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:53.200]   Fortunately, I went to an ophthalmologist
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:57.680]   who understood the literature, thank you Dr. Mark Lurie,
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:02.500]   who understood the literature and made it clear
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:05.660]   that what I needed to do was to occlude the other eye,
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.460]   the eye that was working very well,
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.340]   clearly he understood the work of Hubel and Wiesel,
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:11.180]   now again, you don't want to start playing games
[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:12.500]   with this kind of stuff when you're a kid,
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.820]   if you wear, let's say you have a Halloween costume
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:17.100]   and you wear an eye patch, you're a pirate or something
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.840]   for Halloween and you cover it up on one side,
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.660]   probably for the night of Halloween, it's okay,
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:25.120]   I do not recommend doing that recreationally
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.180]   if you don't need that, if you're a young child
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:29.900]   or for your child to do that because indeed,
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.420]   you create imbalances in the brain machinery
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.900]   that compares information coming in through the two eyes
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:37.980]   and it can shut down the neural information
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.420]   for the occluded, the closed eye.
[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:42.220]   Now I was able to reverse this issue
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:44.220]   but my binocular vision has never been terrific,
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:47.020]   I'm much better at the dartboard and still not very good
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.380]   if I close one eye, I'm much better at the pool table
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.280]   if I close one eye and I still am terrible.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.900]   I was the kid in the outfield,
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:57.500]   the ball's coming towards me, the ball's coming towards me,
[01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:58.320]   I'm going to catch the ball
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.500]   and like a hit me square in the lip.
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.980]   My binocular vision isn't great
[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:05.740]   as a consequence of this early event
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:09.920]   and I have a hard time with those binocular stereograms,
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.140]   those images that are kind of,
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:12.200]   you're supposed to look at them
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.480]   and then the binocular depth image like pops out,
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.900]   all the other kids were going,
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:18.620]   there's the whatever, the Statue of Liberty,
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:21.340]   there's the American, I see dots, okay?
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:24.580]   So I have binocular vision but I use other cues,
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:27.400]   I use the near far cues that I talked about before,
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.700]   motion parallax, the fact that things are closer to me
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.000]   or moving faster than things further away
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.740]   in order to judge depth.
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.540]   And years later when I got involved in,
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.580]   and I don't suggest this for most people,
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:40.820]   I got involved in boxing and martial arts
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:43.440]   when I was younger, sometimes we'll see fighters,
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.060]   this is a slip to avoid getting punched,
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.140]   it's also generating motion parallax.
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:52.660]   Many animals judge depth by moving their head,
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:56.380]   not by using other mechanisms of accommodation, okay?
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:59.180]   So a lot of birds and monkeys and animals
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:02.620]   will judge depth by moving their head like this
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:04.520]   or they'll move from side to side.
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.420]   Animals that will undulate sometimes
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:08.340]   are actually doing a depth measurement
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:10.060]   because as you move from side to side,
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.500]   the brain is able to do the math of depth.
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.340]   So what does this all mean in terms of protocols?
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:16.180]   If you're a young person, do your best
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.540]   to get really good binocular vision,
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.980]   not just at level of your phone or your tablet
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.060]   but also at distance.
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:25.660]   You will build strong binocular visual machinery
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:28.100]   in the brain and at the level of the eyes
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:30.060]   and the eye musculature.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.780]   Now, if you're somebody who did have an occlusion,
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:35.140]   what's needed is to cover up the other eye
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.020]   to create an imbalance so that the weak eye,
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:40.380]   the so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred to as amblyopia,
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.060]   that eye has to work harder.
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:46.180]   So for me, they patched this other eye and made this eye,
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:47.740]   eventually I got vision through that eye back,
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.100]   then they opened them both up.
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.820]   Now, you might ask,
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:53.300]   what happens if you cover both eyes early in life?
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.680]   And this is where it gets interesting.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.240]   You might think, well, if covering one eye
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:00.380]   leads to poor vision for that eye after that eye is open,
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:03.080]   covering both eyes will probably make you blind, right?
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.100]   Actually, that's not what happens.
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:08.300]   What Hubel and Wiesel discovered and what's been affirmed
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:11.500]   many, many more times over in subsequent studies
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.900]   is that it's competitive, that the two eyes are competing
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.460]   for real estate up in the brain.
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.740]   So if you actually cover both eyes,
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:23.060]   you actually extend the period of critical plasticity.
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.660]   This is a really interesting aspect
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.860]   that other people are starting to leverage now
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.440]   in terms of how to reopen plasticity later in life.
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.260]   But please don't go around
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:33.040]   with your eyes covered for too long.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.140]   There are some retreats and stuff where people go into caves
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:39.300]   with absolutely no vision, creates hallucinations.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.440]   We'll talk about why that is in just a moment.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.100]   But here's my suggestion.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.460]   Try and get balanced visual input through the two eyes.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.760]   Almost everybody has a dominant eye.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:50.280]   It usually doesn't relate to your dominant hand,
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.400]   although it can.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.900]   And so for me, if I cover up my right eye,
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:56.960]   I see much less well, much more poorly.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.420]   It's a little bit fuzzy and I have to work harder
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.540]   in order to see the camera, for instance,
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.220]   than if I cover up my left eye,
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:04.860]   it's actually really easy for me to relax.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:06.900]   I have a dominant eye.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:08.200]   Yeah, you can balance that out
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.900]   by covering up the dominant eye a little bit each day.
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:15.900]   But I would warn any young people, meaning 12 or younger,
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:18.080]   against creating these imbalances
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.320]   if there isn't a clinical need to do that.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.700]   And if you do have strong imbalances between the two eyes,
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:27.500]   which can be caused by cataract and lens issues,
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.900]   can be caused by neuromuscular issues, et cetera,
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:32.700]   to try and get those dealt with as early as possible
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:35.380]   by contacting a really good ophthalmologist
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:37.660]   and ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.180]   It is very normal.
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:42.100]   I should say it's very common for young children,
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:45.340]   babies to have an eye that, with strabismus,
[01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:47.980]   that either deviates out or that deviates in.
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:50.140]   It is important to correct that.
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:53.180]   If you would like to have balanced vision
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:56.140]   between the two eyes and for the brain to respond
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.080]   equally to the two eyes and to have,
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.460]   I would say, high-fidelity quality vision.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.860]   Although some people who have an eye that drifts
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:06.580]   can function normally in life,
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:09.180]   you have an opportunity early in life to rescue that.
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:11.700]   I won't do, well, maybe I will do this,
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.500]   but I can actually relax this eye.
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.120]   It's so weak in some cases
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.460]   that it actually can start to deviate.
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:18.380]   Here, I'll just do this here.
[01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:19.220]   It's not crossing my eyes.
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:22.260]   So I actually can move, I can misalign my eyes
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.940]   because I have to fight very hard
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:26.580]   to have the musculature for this eye,
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.700]   keep that eye aligned with the other eye.
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.920]   And that's because I've been doing eye exercises
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.340]   since I was in my 20s
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:34.220]   'cause I noticed when I would study a lot,
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:35.300]   this eye would start to drift in.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:36.460]   I'd start to see double in.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:38.600]   And then next thing you know, I was just covering the eye up.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.900]   It was getting weaker and weaker,
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.780]   just like the atrophy of a muscle.
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:43.100]   So I went to the doctor.
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:43.920]   What did they do?
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.620]   They did the exact wrong thing.
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:47.820]   The optometrist I went to gave me a prism,
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:50.020]   which adjusted it so that I could see things normally,
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.780]   which just made the eye weaker and weaker.
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:54.600]   It's like putting a weak arm into a sling.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.720]   So I had to spend at least three years of 10 minutes a day,
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.800]   that's what I recommend,
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:03.940]   doing near far, covering up my good eye,
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:05.880]   doing near far with my bad eye.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:09.360]   And now it's been about 10, 12 years
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.440]   that I have pretty decent binocular vision.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.400]   Now, many of you aren't dealing with this
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.440]   or have these early childhood issues.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.240]   Some of you might be experiencing challenges
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.060]   with fatigued eyes or with differences
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:24.260]   in focus with the two eyes.
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:26.860]   These eye exercises of near far smooth pursuit
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:29.960]   and checking for dominant and non-dominant eye
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.700]   can be very beneficial.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:32.820]   Again, I'm not a clinician,
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:35.740]   so I don't want to give you protocols
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:37.380]   or enforce protocols on anybody.
[01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:39.340]   You need to figure out what's right and safe for you,
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:42.060]   giving your vision history.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:44.340]   I do recommend talking to a really good ophthalmologist
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:46.640]   if you have severe vision problems of any kind,
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.760]   or if you want to offset vision problems of any kind.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.160]   An optometrist as well,
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.940]   but ideally it would be a neuro-ophthalmologist.
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:56.560]   Okay, I did mention hallucinations
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.000]   and they're fun to talk about and think about.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.460]   For years, people have asked,
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:03.280]   why do people get visual hallucinations?
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.600]   Costello's in sleep right now.
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.680]   You can probably hear him snoring, he's snoring so loud.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:09.800]   He's probably having hallucinations about rabbits, pizza,
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.400]   and those are mainly his favorite, and sleep.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.360]   He's dreaming about sleep in sleep.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:18.440]   Hallucinations are a property of the visual system
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.940]   and it was always thought that hallucinations arise
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:24.280]   because of over-activation or activation
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.820]   of certain aspects of the visual system.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:27.420]   I just briefly want to mention a paper
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:28.740]   that was published by my good friend
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:33.040]   and phenomenal scientist and physicist for that matter,
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.580]   Chris Neal, who's up at the University of Oregon in Eugene.
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:38.920]   They studied LSD-like compounds
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.260]   and discovered that hallucinations actually occur
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:46.200]   because portions of your brain become underactive.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.020]   The visual portions of your brain are understimulated.
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:52.540]   This is probably why when people go into these cave retreats,
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:55.180]   something I've never done, I don't think I ever will do,
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:56.760]   where it's completely black,
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.900]   pretty soon they start hallucinating.
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.860]   They start seeing things, even though there's nothing there.
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.880]   The visual system is desperate to make guesses
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.020]   about what's out in the world.
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:07.520]   It's like the eager beaver of your brain.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.620]   It's like, what's out there, what's out there,
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:10.220]   what's out there?
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.940]   Even in low to no vision people, blind people,
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:15.540]   their brain is going to be making guesses
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.180]   about what's out there in the auditory world.
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:18.180]   What sounds are there?
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:20.740]   What touch sensations are there?
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:23.380]   For sighted folks, it's going to be
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:24.940]   what's out there in terms of light.
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:26.160]   Light is the dominant way.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.180]   Vision is the dominant way
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:29.220]   that we evaluate the world around us.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.740]   So it turns out that hallucinations
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:34.220]   are an underactivation of the visual system
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:35.580]   and then a compensatory,
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:37.980]   a compensation by which the visual system
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:41.020]   creates activity and hallucinations.
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:42.640]   So if you're in the dark long enough,
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.660]   you start to hallucinate and see things.
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:47.680]   So that's a little note about hallucinations.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.860]   One of the things that you can do to improve your vision,
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:51.500]   and it's also kind of fun,
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.980]   is to put a Snellen chart in your home.
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:57.240]   A Snellen chart is that list of letters.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.840]   If you go to the dreaded Department of Motor Vehicles,
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.120]   actually I'm up for renewal soon,
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.560]   so I love the Department of Motor Vehicles.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.680]   The Department of Motor Vehicles
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.280]   will have you cover up an eye,
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.420]   read the letters on the chart.
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:11.060]   The letters, of course, get smaller and smaller.
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:13.600]   They're trying to figure out roughly what your vision is.
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.480]   Cover up the other eye, you'll do that.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.580]   Some people, including nerdy vision scientists like me,
[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:22.020]   have had Snellen charts in their office
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.240]   or in their home for many years now,
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.220]   and you can just practice,
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:26.240]   and you can see how you're doing
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.900]   sitting at a particular distance.
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:31.200]   This is something that's not often mentioned,
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.540]   but your performance on the Snellen chart will vary
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:36.140]   depending on time of day,
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:37.980]   because your level of fatigue
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:39.900]   and your ability to control that accommodation
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.520]   and other mechanisms of the eye muscles will vary.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.540]   So you can take it as an average.
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:46.380]   It's also a good thing
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:48.100]   if you're going to get your vision tested
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.640]   for corrective lenses,
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.520]   or maybe you're going to do laser surgery
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.540]   or something of that sort,
[01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:53.780]   if you're thinking about any of that,
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:55.620]   to really get it measured by a professional.
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:57.820]   The ones that you get in those supermarkets
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:00.980]   or in many eyeglass stores,
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:02.220]   apologies to the eyeglass stores,
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:05.420]   are often wrong by an order of magnitude.
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:08.900]   And then when you start putting corrective lenses on
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:12.340]   that are over-correcting or under-correcting,
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:14.340]   but more often are over-correcting,
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:16.180]   then you're essentially weakening the system.
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.860]   It's like putting a prosthetic on a limb
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:21.220]   that you didn't necessarily need or a robot arm
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:23.620]   when you didn't need the use of the robot arm.
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.720]   Although now there's so much excitement about robots,
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.780]   I think people are going to be doing that.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:30.060]   Anyway, nonetheless, get your vision tested
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:32.100]   by somebody who really understands vision,
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:34.740]   like an ophthalmologist or a really good optometrist.
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:38.860]   If you put a Snellen chart in your home,
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.380]   you can do that as part of your visual training.
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:43.380]   Now, this might seem excessively nerdy,
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:46.760]   but what is more important than your eyesight, right?
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.020]   Eyesight is so vital.
[01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:49.420]   It's right up there with movement
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:51.340]   and our ability to move, to generate,
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:53.360]   to get up out of chairs and to walk and to run
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.240]   and to take care of ourselves.
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.860]   Eyesight and movement are the main ways
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:00.620]   that we are able to take care of ourselves
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:01.780]   and take care of others.
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:03.980]   When you start having compromised eyesight
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:06.660]   or compromised movement, people need to take care of us
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:08.700]   and we become much more challenged
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:10.320]   in moving through our daily life.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.360]   So while it might seem nerdy
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.440]   to have a Snellen chart in your home
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:16.520]   or to do a smooth pursuit exercise a couple of times a week
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:18.100]   or to get outside for a few hours a day
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.800]   and do your reading or your laptop work there,
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.220]   preserving your eyesight and preserving your vision
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:25.640]   is one of the most life enhancing
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.920]   or quality of life enhancing things that you can do.
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.580]   And if you're a young person
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:32.820]   and you can build some of this into your framework
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:36.300]   of exercise or brain training, if you want to call it that,
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.560]   that can be immensely beneficial
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.900]   and will really set you up to have really good vision
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:41.240]   over a long period of time.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:42.940]   Now, of course, there are genetic factors
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:45.300]   and there are injury related factors
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:48.500]   that can compromise eyesight and our ability to see.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:51.620]   And of course, the things I'm talking about today
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.500]   aren't going to solve all those issues,
[01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:57.000]   but they can have a tremendous positive impact
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.900]   if you're willing to do just a little bit of work
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:02.660]   and none of this is involving any cost, right?
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.320]   It's just time cost.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.840]   So I do want to talk about a few other things
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.360]   that can perhaps improve vision.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.340]   I want to dispel a few myths about stuff to take
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:13.540]   to improve vision.
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:15.780]   And then I want to just close
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:19.800]   by talking about how we perceive time using our vision,
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:21.460]   because that will nicely set the stage
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:23.980]   for what we're going to talk about next episode.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:27.560]   So now you understand a lot about the biology of vision.
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:29.540]   You understand that light has to arrive at the retina
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:32.020]   and get converted into electrical signals.
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:36.420]   That process requires things like vitamin A,
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:38.540]   a fat soluble vitamin.
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:42.060]   It requires things like the carotenoids.
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:45.440]   That metabolic cascade, the biochemical cascade
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:47.820]   is essential for vision.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:49.220]   And this is why you've been told
[01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:50.900]   that carrots help you see better
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:52.500]   'cause they're high in vitamin A.
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.340]   There are a few simple things you can do
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:56.820]   to support your vision.
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:01.820]   First of all, it is true that eating vegetables,
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:05.060]   the dark leafy vegetables and things like carrots
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:08.020]   that have vitamin A in abundance
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:11.160]   and eating them in close to their raw form,
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:14.740]   so naturally occurring foods that contain a lot of vitamin A
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:19.420]   in their raw form can help support vision.
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:21.400]   Now, does that mean that if you ingest
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.540]   super physiological amounts of that stuff
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:25.800]   that it's going to make your vision that much better?
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.580]   No, but you do need a threshold level of vitamin A
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:33.740]   in order to see and in order to see well.
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:36.560]   Now, there's a lot of excitement nowadays
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:39.300]   about supplementation to help support
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:40.740]   the health of the visual system.
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:43.060]   And I'm somebody who's pretty open
[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:45.180]   to novel forms of supplementation.
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.220]   You've probably gathered that
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:48.800]   if you've been listening to this podcast for a while.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:51.760]   You have to determine what's safe and economical
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:55.660]   and right for you, what your risk tolerance is, et cetera.
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:58.620]   But I want to talk about a molecule
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.700]   that's in a lot of supplements to support vision.
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.900]   And there are some really good data on and that's lutein.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.600]   Now, the study I want to describe
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:11.300]   is actually published in 2016.
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:12.980]   It's from the Journal of Ophthalmology.
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:15.060]   It's a good journal.
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:18.360]   And the title of this paper might catch your attention.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.020]   It's increased macular pigment optical density.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.080]   That just means that the macula
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.900]   is an area of the eye for central vision,
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:28.080]   for high acuity vision.
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:31.180]   Pigment density there is good.
[01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:32.860]   You want pigment there.
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:35.760]   Increased macular pigment optical density.
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.980]   And visual acuity.
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:40.420]   Visual acuity is your ability to see things in fine detail.
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:43.060]   Following consumption of a buttermilk drink
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:45.680]   containing lutein enriched egg yolks.
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:47.460]   Remember raw foods?
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:49.160]   Lutein enriched egg yolks.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.420]   Sounds like a Rocky movie
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:52.820]   where he would drink the raw egg yolks.
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:56.160]   A randomized double blind placebo controlled trial.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:59.460]   Now I'm not suggesting you go out and eat raw egg yolks.
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:00.580]   There's the risk of salmonella.
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:01.740]   Although I did hear this.
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:02.740]   Someone correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:06.040]   but the salmonella is actually on the outside of the egg,
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.680]   not actually in the egg itself.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.860]   It's on the shell for reasons that relate
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:13.280]   to how that egg got into the world.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.120]   That's where the salmonella lives.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.300]   But I could be wrong about that.
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:19.700]   But raw egg yolks are not something
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:21.920]   that most people want to consume.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:23.240]   What is this lutein stuff?
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:27.540]   Well, lutein is in the pathway that relates to vitamin A
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:31.920]   and the formation of the opsin, the photopigment,
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.820]   that captures light in the back of your eye,
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:37.460]   literally absorbs light, pigment in your eye,
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:39.300]   and converts that into electrical signals
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:40.680]   and allows you to see.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:42.340]   And there is some evidence.
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:44.320]   I spoke to our chair of ophthalmology.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:48.080]   There is some evidence through quality peer reviewed studies
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:53.080]   that supplementing with lutein can help offset
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.260]   some of the detrimental effects
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:58.760]   of age-related macular degeneration.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:03.100]   But, I want to emphasize but, or emphasize however,
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:07.100]   only for individuals with moderate
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:09.520]   to severe macular degeneration.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.600]   For people that have normal vision
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.600]   or with just a low degree of macular degeneration,
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.300]   these studies did not see a significant improvement
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.980]   of vision from supplementing with lutein.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:23.960]   So I'm not going to tell you to supplement with lutein
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:24.800]   or not.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:28.000]   I don't think any study is holy,
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.620]   but it does seem that if you have moderate
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:32.600]   to severe macular degeneration,
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:33.800]   talk to your physician, of course,
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:35.140]   talk to your ophthalmologist.
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:37.540]   I'll always say that and I'll say it three times.
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:42.960]   Supplementing with lutein could perhaps support vision
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.000]   and offset some vision loss in that case.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.960]   Probably also talk to your ophthalmologist
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.280]   or consider the red light therapy
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.720]   that I talked about earlier.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:51.920]   Whereas if you have normal vision
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:55.500]   or a low amount of macular degeneration,
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.480]   it does not seem, at least from these studies,
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.720]   that lutein can have much of an effect.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:03.820]   Now I know and I confess I'm sort of of the mind
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:08.820]   that if I personally had age-related macular degeneration
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.680]   or a propensity for it in my family,
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:11.920]   which fortunately I don't,
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:16.560]   but in that case, I would think that supplementing
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.880]   with lutein, provided it's safe,
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.520]   could perhaps be of benefit
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.440]   and you might want to consider a low dose of that.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.040]   So again, I'm not pushing any of this on anybody
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:27.160]   by any means, but you should know
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.000]   that under certain conditions
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.460]   of severe macular degeneration
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:31.800]   or moderate macular degeneration,
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.400]   it does seem like lutein can be beneficial.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.040]   It does not have to be consumed through raw egg yolks,
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:39.880]   although that is the highest density source.
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:43.440]   Cooking your eggs, if you like your scrambled eggs dry
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:48.360]   or you like your eggs not easy over or whatever, not runny,
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.000]   then you aren't going to get the benefits of the leucine.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.360]   There are other sources of leucine,
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.880]   non-animal sources of leucine as well.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.980]   You can look those up on the internet.
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:00.800]   Now, there are other compounds that have been shown
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.000]   to perhaps be important for offsetting
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.440]   or helping different forms of vision loss.
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.400]   One is, I'm going to spell this out,
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.400]   I-D-E-B-E-N-O-N-E, indebenone, indebenone, indebenone.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:17.400]   I can never pronounce these compounds, forgive me,
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:20.440]   unless I've worked with them.
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.600]   There is evidence that it can be beneficial
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:27.520]   for Leber's congenital eye disease.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.980]   I would definitely go onto examine.com,
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:32.700]   put in I-D-E-B-E-N-O-N-E,
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:36.560]   and for things like Leber's optic neuropathies,
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:39.660]   which is a degenerative condition of the eye.
[01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:42.100]   Whether or not people should just be taking this stuff anyway
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:43.220]   is still an open question.
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.260]   There aren't a lot of studies about it.
[01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:47.460]   A lot of people that are interested in taking things
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:50.460]   to support their vision are taking leucine
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:53.020]   as a preventative measure.
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.360]   I don't pass any judgment one way or the other.
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.360]   Typically, those supplements also include the zeaxathins
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.520]   and the astaxyns.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:05.640]   Okay, the pronunciation of this is terrible, I'm sure,
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.020]   but that's not too far off.
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:12.020]   But basically, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:13.840]   Let's see why it's hard to pronounce.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:18.840]   Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N, and the other one is A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:23.840]   Both of these have been shown, excuse me,
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:27.740]   both of these have been shown to offset
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:32.740]   some of the disruption in vision that occurs with aging.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:35.320]   What is astaxaxthin?
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.420]   It's a really interesting compound.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:41.120]   It's the red pink pigment found in various seafoods.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.880]   So shrimp, I'm not a big seafood fan,
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:47.180]   but like certain fish, like you'll see at the fish market,
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:49.480]   will have that red pink pigment,
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.740]   and it's also in the feathers of flamingos.
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:54.240]   Please don't eat the feathers of flamingos,
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.320]   and please also don't eat flamingos.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:59.520]   It's structurally similar to beta carotene,
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:02.000]   so it's very pro vitamin A,
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.680]   but it has some chemical differences
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:05.860]   which may make it safer than vitamin A.
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:09.180]   Remember, vitamin A is a lipid-soluble vitamin,
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:12.680]   so it can be stored in our body for long periods of time.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.520]   What is the deal with this astaxaxthin?
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.440]   What are its drawbacks?
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:20.760]   Well, we can go to our ever-favorite examine.com.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:21.600]   What does it do?
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.400]   Well, it has a number of different effects,
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:24.380]   a huge number, in fact,
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.800]   but it does seem to notably increase,
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.600]   it's now been shown in three studies,
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:32.800]   the antioxidant enzyme profile.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.820]   It has a number of different effects,
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:36.780]   but the most notable for sake of this episode
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:39.140]   is the one on ocular blood flow.
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:41.900]   It does seem to increase the amount of ocular blood flow,
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:43.680]   so the blood supply to the eyes,
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:46.080]   so that makes it an interesting compound.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:49.820]   Has a number of other effects for whatever reason.
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:51.760]   It also has a notable effect,
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.720]   several studies have shown this,
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.560]   on fertility in males,
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:59.600]   so it seems to at least double the pregnancy rate
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:02.340]   when men take astaxaxanthin
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:06.880]   and works, in particular, it seems here,
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.600]   in men that were previously infertile.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:11.240]   So I don't know if that has something to do
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.360]   with the blood flow to the eyes, probably not.
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.200]   It probably has something to do
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.620]   with something unrelated to the eyes.
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:19.100]   Nonetheless, that's an effect of this molecule.
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:21.800]   It's also been shown to have positive effects
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:24.280]   on things like skin elasticity, skin moisture,
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.800]   skin quality, et cetera,
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.760]   probably due to its effects on blood flow.
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:33.760]   So lutein, astaxanthin, A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N,
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:37.340]   and for people who have concerns
[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:39.400]   about Leber's optic neuropathies,
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.720]   which is going to be a small percentage of people out there,
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:44.080]   but that is a pretty severe condition,
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:46.960]   there are supplements that are available out there.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.200]   I do encourage you, as always,
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:51.580]   to talk to your ophthalmologist and physician about them.
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:53.600]   And I will say that there are a number of people
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.120]   that take lutein and some of these other things
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.240]   as a precautionary measure in order to bolster their health,
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:01.520]   in the same way that some people take vitamins and minerals
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:02.360]   to bolster their health,
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.260]   and some people are very, health, excuse me,
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:05.880]   and some people are very averse
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:07.080]   to taking vitamins and minerals
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.640]   'cause they feel like they can get all that
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:10.080]   from healthy whole foods.
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:13.840]   And of course, you can get these things from whole foods.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.160]   The question is whether or not you can get them
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.280]   in concentrations that are sufficient.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.200]   I do think that in the years to come,
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:22.720]   we are going to see more about lutein.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.240]   I think we are going to see more
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:28.280]   about some of these other compounds like acetaxaxone,
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.760]   and hopefully by then I'll be able to pronounce it.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.160]   But at present, these things are more or less
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.920]   in the kind of experimental or self-experimental phase.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:39.200]   There are some good double-blind placebo-controlled studies
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:41.840]   like the egg yolk buttermilk study of all things,
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.480]   published in really good journals.
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:47.920]   Journal of ophthalmology, journal investigative ophthalmology
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:50.400]   and vision sciences, these are good journals.
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:53.360]   These are journals that are peer-reviewed by experts.
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.920]   The study that I mentioned earlier about keeping rooms dark,
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:59.880]   that was also published in an excellent journal.
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.920]   I think it was JAMA, I'll go back and look.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:04.880]   It's not on my screen any longer, but very easy to find.
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:06.420]   And there've been some follow-up studies as well
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:09.600]   from the University of Pennsylvania and other universities.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:13.000]   So everything I've talked about today relates to studies
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.520]   that were done and published in quality peer-reviewed
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.800]   journals, that doesn't necessarily mean you want to run out
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.920]   and start taking the stuff that I've described,
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.640]   or even doing the protocols I've described.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:24.640]   I've given you an array, a pallet, a buffet, if you will,
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.720]   of things that you could do to try and enhance
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:29.840]   or support your vision, depending on how good your vision
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:33.320]   is, your family history of vision and vision loss,
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.320]   your occupational hazards.
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:38.600]   People that work with metal filings that are flying
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.480]   out of machines are going to have a higher degree
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:46.080]   of risk to their visual system than will people
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:47.080]   who just do office work.
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.960]   Although if you're doing a lot of office work,
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:51.660]   chances are you're not getting a lot of long view vision,
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:53.480]   your accommodation mechanisms are going to start
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:54.480]   to suffer over time.
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:56.640]   I think we can reliably predict that.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:59.520]   So I've tried to give you an array of behavioral tools
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.080]   and we did touch upon some supplementation tools.
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.040]   I'd be remiss if I didn't say that because blood flow
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.120]   is so critical for the neurons of the eye,
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:10.120]   remember these are the most metabolically active cells
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:12.760]   in your entire body, the cells within your retina,
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:15.080]   because blood flow is required to get them the energy
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:16.240]   and nutrients they need.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:19.360]   Having a healthy cardiovascular system, right?
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:22.440]   Doing endurance work, doing strength training work
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:25.780]   regularly is going to support your eyes and your brain
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:26.620]   and your vision.
[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:28.860]   It's indirect, but it's essential, right?
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:31.740]   It's necessary, but it's not going to be sufficient.
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:33.560]   You're going to have to do other things to support
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.860]   your eyesight as well.
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:36.720]   But having a healthy cardiovascular system
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:39.420]   because it's going to deliver blood and oxygen
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:42.500]   and nutrients to this incredible apparati
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:45.900]   on the front of your face, these two pieces of brain,
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:48.420]   is going to support your overall brain health
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:50.080]   and vision over time.
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.700]   So early in the podcast, I talked about how the optimal
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.680]   window for learning is 90 minutes.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:57.440]   That's the so-called ultradian cycle for learning.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:59.480]   That's why we held our episodes to about 90 minutes.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.140]   They're now starting to extend into the hour and 50 minute
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:03.680]   and two hour mark.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:06.040]   That simply reflects my enthusiasm and excitement
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:07.700]   about these topics and my desire to give you
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:10.980]   as much information as I possibly can in each episode.
[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:12.400]   Please remember, you don't have to listen
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.060]   to the whole episode all at once.
[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:15.160]   Everything is timestamped.
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.940]   Everything is captioned in English and Spanish.
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:20.200]   The captions take a few days on YouTube.
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:22.600]   We apologize for that, but in order to have them done
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.900]   correctly, it takes a few days after it's posted.
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:29.480]   So if you need those captions, please check back
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:33.420]   maybe 24 or 48 hours after the episodes are released.
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:36.020]   If you're enjoying this podcast and the information,
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:37.480]   if you're finding it beneficial,
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.400]   there are a couple of things that you can do
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.860]   that are totally zero cost that really help us
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:44.260]   and help you get this information going forward.
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:46.740]   One is if you don't already subscribe on YouTube,
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:48.400]   please do subscribe.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:50.540]   We release episodes every Monday and hopefully soon,
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:53.180]   more often than that, shorter episodes as well.
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.820]   But every Monday we release an episode,
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:56.780]   please do subscribe.
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:59.240]   If you don't already subscribe on Apple and Spotify,
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:01.720]   that's very beneficial, please do that.
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.000]   That helps us as well.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.900]   If you could give us a five-star review on Apple,
[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:06.780]   if you feel that that's what we deserve
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:08.660]   and Apple also gives you the opportunity
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.640]   to give us comments, feedback about the episodes.
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:13.660]   If you have suggestions about episodes,
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.660]   feedback of any kind,
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:19.120]   please put it in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:20.960]   Routinely throughout the week after the release
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.580]   of each episode, I cover content in shorter format
[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:26.100]   and in more depth on Instagram @hubermanlab.
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:31.860]   Every episode is also indexed and searchable
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:34.820]   in the search function on our website, hubermanlab.com.
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:37.820]   That's also where we post links to various studies
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:40.620]   and downloadable protocols, all zero cost.
[01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:42.760]   And as I mentioned, you can search for different topics
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:45.180]   and it will bring you to the particular episodes
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:48.020]   that contain the information on those topics.
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:50.500]   If you'd like to support us on Patreon,
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:51.620]   we have a Patreon account.
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:54.780]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:57.400]   There you can support us at any level that you like.
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:59.540]   As well, if you'd like to support us,
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.020]   please check out our sponsors.
[01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:02.180]   The sponsors that we discussed
[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:04.380]   at the beginning of the podcast are a vital way
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:06.500]   to keep the information being distributed
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.980]   at zero cost to everybody.
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:11.820]   We only work with sponsors that we really love
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:14.020]   their products and that we really respect the people
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:15.520]   that we're working with there.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:18.220]   And of course, there's no obligation to purchase
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.900]   or to even check out those sponsors.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:21.300]   But if you're in a position to do so,
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:23.040]   that really does help us.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.520]   Routinely throughout the podcast, we talk about supplements.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:26.780]   There are a lot of supplement companies
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:28.940]   and sources of supplements out there.
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:30.700]   The one that we work with and that we partnered with
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:33.160]   is Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.340]   because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:38.280]   in terms of what they say is in their supplements
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.380]   is actually in their supplements
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:41.220]   because it's independently tested and verified,
[01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:44.200]   as well as the amounts that they list on the bottles
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:47.620]   actually are matched by what's in the capsules and tablets.
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:49.800]   That's a serious problem in the supplement industry.
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.880]   And Thorne deals with that problem by being very truthful
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:55.200]   and very accurate about what's in their supplements
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:56.820]   and how much of those things are in there.
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:58.660]   If you want to see the supplements that I take,
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:00.720]   you can go to thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:04.340]   .com/u/huberman.
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:06.580]   There you'll see all the supplements that I take.
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:08.820]   You can get 20% off any of those supplements,
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:11.300]   as well as 20% off any of the other supplements
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:13.040]   that Thorne happens to make
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.740]   if you happen to navigate into their website
[01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:16.340]   through that portal,
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:19.860]   thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:21.260]   And last but not least,
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:23.380]   I want to thank you for your time and attention today,
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:25.940]   your willingness to learn about vision in the visual system
[01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:27.560]   and the various things that you can do
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.360]   to help support the health and functioning
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.780]   of your visual system.
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:31.920]   And of course, I want to thank you
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:33.260]   for your interest in science.
[01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:35.840]   [upbeat music]
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:38.420]   (upbeat music)
