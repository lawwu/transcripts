[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.520]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while

[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.800]   My guest today is Keturah Free.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.160]   Keturah is a personal finance blogger and she's a wife and mother.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.920]   And today she's here to share some of her experience and some of her knowledge and insight
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.080]   into how you can save money by learning to more effectively cook at home.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.520]   Keturah, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.520]   Thank you.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.520]   Thanks for having me.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:41.160]   So I've invited you on, secret society of Radical Personal Finance guests, to talk today
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.240]   about meal planning and meal preparation.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.920]   I know this is something that you care a lot about, you write a lot about on your website,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.920]   freetocook.com.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.280]   And I'd love for you to start though by simply sharing your story.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.480]   What's your personal story as it relates to money?
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.160]   Our personal story is I am a mother of four.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.200]   My husband and I, a handful of years ago, we were kind of doing what we like to call
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.280]   hot bunking where my husband...
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.680]   That's a military term.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.680]   I like it.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.040]   My husband worked nights and I worked during the day.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.600]   So our bed was constantly hot from someone being in there.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:38.280]   That made it very difficult for us to have good quality family time.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.680]   So a lot of times, we would just kind of do whatever.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:52.400]   But the days that he was off, it was really important for us to have family meal time.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.240]   A while back, we had read some stuff from a therapist that had kind of talked about
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.920]   how family meal time is actually very beneficial.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.600]   Not only does it save you money from eating at home instead of eating out, but just that
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.080]   you have a lot of psychological benefits from eating as a family.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.840]   So that's kind of how we started things.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:28.680]   Obviously, we like to save money by eating at home as well.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.800]   And then recently, within the last year, we have decided that it's going to be more beneficial
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.360]   for our family for me to be a stay-at-home mom and also blog instead of working outside
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360]   of the home.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.440]   So that also kind of worked with our budget and all of that to try and keep a lot of our
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.840]   meals in our house.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.840]   So.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.440]   Were you always good at, like in the time that both of you guys were working, were you
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.160]   good at saving money and eating at home or was this a transformation of some kind that
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.480]   you went through?
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:14.920]   I would say we were starting to eat out a lot just because life gets busy and instead
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.280]   of spending that time at home, it was just, "Oh, well, that was so much easier to do this
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.680]   as we were taking the kids from here or there or running to the next place."
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.560]   A lot of times for my husband and I, we would go out to lunch a lot since that was kind
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.440]   of like his in-between time of where he was going to work and I was, at least I was
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   off for lunch.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.440]   So we would kind of do a lot of the out to eat for lunch, which is not a whole lot more
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.000]   expensive or less expensive to tell you the truth.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.400]   So we were still spending a lot of money doing that kind of stuff.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.360]   Did you track since you started making a focused effort to eat at home more, did you track
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.960]   the difference that that made in your family budget by any chance?
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   You know, I don't think we did like a huge like, "This is how much we're saving each
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.840]   month," because our family, we had also added on two children in that time frame.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.640]   So it's kind of hard to figure out because we're not really comparing apples to apples
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.840]   at that point.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:28.040]   But I would say, you know, more recently, we were at least going out to eat one night
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.840]   a week as a family.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.240]   Give or take, we were even going to like Chick-fil-A and stuff like that.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   Well, even with our family of six, going to Chick-fil-A is $35.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:49.880]   So $35 times four in a month, we're still spending $130, $140 give or take just to go
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.640]   out to Chick-fil-A once a week.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.720]   So for us, we're at least saving that much.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.560]   What do you do to encourage other people to eat at home more?
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.520]   I personally make a weekly menu.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:17.800]   I put that on my blog each week just to kind of help encourage others to eat at home.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.160]   A lot of my menus include recipes that I've already had on the blog.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.160]   So it's kind of like, "Here's something that you can make along with me."
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.960]   And when I'm making my menus each week, I base it off of our weekly ad and we shop at
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.960]   Publix.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.980]   So I just go on there and make our meals based off of things that they have on sale each
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:51.240]   week or if I have things in our pantry that we've gotten in other sales and things like
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   that.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.760]   So that's kind of what I do and then if somebody doesn't like that recipe, we'll put something
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   else in place.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.360]   Publix is the greatest southern treasure that a quarter of the US gets to experience.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:14.800]   So my wife and I, we always find this area to be challenging and it seems like – we
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   don't eat out very much.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.960]   Generally, if we eat out, it's planned and it's a specific location.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.960]   But I still find it – we find it challenging just simply to control the grocery bill.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.240]   I often feel when I go through our budget, I'm like, "Man, it just seems like we
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.000]   shouldn't have to spend as much as we do in this category."
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.200]   So I'm always looking for ideas and ways that we can get better but it's challenging
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.520]   because we're all busy and it takes time.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.400]   As with anything, it takes time to be proactive, to be ahead of the game in order to make progress
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.680]   in this area.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.800]   When you sit down and look at a sale flyer from the grocery store, how do you convert
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.680]   that into a menu?
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.960]   I would say for someone who's just kind of starting out is just to maybe just make
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.160]   a list of all of the meals that you like.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:16.960]   Now for me, when I first started dating my husband, I kind of made that a challenge where
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.920]   I did not want to make the same thing for him for a year which that's a little bit
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.320]   much for most people and that's not to say that I didn't make some of his favorites
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.440]   every now and then or whatever but that's kind of how I had challenged myself.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:41.600]   The average person though, if you come up with even 30 meals that you can rotate in,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.000]   in that way it's pretty easy for you to go through a flyer and say, "Okay, chicken's
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.120]   on sale.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.400]   We like chicken enchiladas," for example.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.760]   Then what I can do also with some of my meals that I have posted on the blog, like chicken
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.720]   enchiladas is a perfect example.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.160]   That for our family makes two pans.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.600]   I make one tonight and then I freeze the second one so that if we come up short on another
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.720]   week or whatever the case may be, if I need something quicker where I don't need all
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.800]   the meal prep, then we can just pull it out and then throw it in the oven and we're
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   done.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.360]   I think that's really helpful too to kind of just have a handful of meals that you can
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:37.760]   either make doubles of and it's not really that hard to do that or if you're having
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.720]   company over and you need those two pans, then you have two pans.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.240]   I would say that's probably the big thing for a lot of people is to kind of know what
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.600]   meals your family likes so that you can kind of rotate them in a month or whatever as you're
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   looking at the ads.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.120]   What's the hardest thing for people who are intentionally focusing on this goal of
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.120]   eating at home more?
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.660]   What's the hardest, what's the biggest complaint that people have, the biggest thing
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.760]   they find difficult to make this transition?
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.740]   I would say that it's time.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:22.040]   Our society has made it seem like dinner is just this big huge task and it's going
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.920]   to just take so much of your time away and all of that and it's really not true.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:37.720]   A lot of things, if you can just prep ahead of time, then it won't take near as much
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.400]   of your time.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.720]   Just like I was talking about with the chicken enchiladas, if you prepped that ahead in the
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.360]   week, you had that already in your refrigerator or your freezer and you could just pull it
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.640]   out, well that took out so much of your time there.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   It's just a little bit of prep time that if you could do that ahead of time or even
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:07.280]   just cutting your vegetables ahead and putting them away in your refrigerator already pre-cut
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.520]   and things like that where you're just taking that time off earlier in the week instead
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.520]   of having to do those things ahead of time.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.480]   I think that's one of the things that people really, when they look at having to eat at
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.640]   home more, it just seems so big.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.920]   They think that they have to make these elaborate meals and stuff and it's really not even about
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   that.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.320]   What do you think about the once a month freezer cooking idea?
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.560]   I think it's great.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:47.960]   I believe it was Dave Ramsey that even said that it's a huge money saver if you can shop
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:54.280]   more at one time than going small times all the time to the grocery store.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.020]   My husband actually works in the grocery store industry and one of the things that they bank
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:06.640]   on is that each trip you come, you're going to grab something else that you did not need
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.200]   that was not on your list and that's an add-on situation.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.800]   Each time, it doesn't really seem like you're grabbing something that's really such a big
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.480]   deal and it's going to break the bank.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.400]   Oh, it's just a Coke, okay, or something like that.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:30.080]   If you look at that over time, then that is adding so much more to your budget each month
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.360]   by just adding on one little thing.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.800]   If you can even do even a week at a time, two weeks at a time freezer meals and things
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.840]   like that, then that's such a big help to cut down on your budget because that's more
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   trips you're not taking to the grocery store.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.480]   Yeah, a lot of times it's just cooking and working.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:59.880]   For so many people, it's an endless cycle because if you have a dual parent household
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.720]   where both parents are working outside of the house and especially if you had kids in
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:12.320]   the mix, that evening time from 5 to 7 is the most stressful time of the day.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   Absolutely.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.400]   The kids are at the end of their rope because they're hungry and they're tired and they're
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.720]   cranky.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.480]   And then mom and dad are tired from working all day and then just the mental energy to
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.600]   say, "Well, I'm going to go home and whip up a beautiful, fresh, home-cooked meal out
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.960]   of fresh ingredients."
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.080]   It doesn't happen.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:37.120]   But because it doesn't happen, then you wind up swinging by Boston Market or swinging by
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.280]   wherever and picking up a meal to go or going out.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.200]   Well then you keep yourself stuck with high expenses and because of the high expenses,
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.720]   you look at the budget and say, "Well, there's nothing we can cut here.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.200]   We've got to make this money."
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   And it's an endless cycle.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.800]   It's got to at some point change somewhere.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.760]   And I think especially for parents who are working during the week, freezer cooking has
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.880]   a lot of potential for many families.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.360]   Yes, definitely.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.280]   And I mean, just looking up recipes in general where you know that you can put them in the
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:15.160]   freezer and it doesn't necessarily have to be all like crockpot meals.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:22.600]   I had a friend that when she was pregnant actually, she had limited freezer space and
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.560]   we kind of worked with her freezer space and said, "Okay.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:33.880]   Well, you can put this one in your freezer flat and then as you take it out of the freezer,
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.080]   put it in the refrigerator, it thaws out.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.280]   All you have to do is put it in the pan and it's done."
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.000]   So it doesn't necessarily always have to be crockpot meals too because a lot of times
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.720]   think, "Oh, I don't even have a crockpot," or whatever.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.840]   It's not always about that.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:54.800]   I think sometimes it's just even if you make batches of spaghetti sauce or chili, you can
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.080]   make lots of things with chili ahead of time too.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.840]   Nachos, hello.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:06.800]   So I think a lot of that too, people just think that it has to be the thing that you
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.200]   put it in there for.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:14.160]   Spaghetti sauce actually makes a really great base for homemade pizza.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.280]   Things like that, just kind of looking outside of the box where you can do other things with
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.280]   what you have.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.960]   Any other tips for those who are looking to transition things that you've learned that
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.760]   have helped you be able to make progress here?
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:39.120]   When we first started this, we just looked at cutting one day out a week of going out,
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.920]   one meal.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:47.520]   And I think sometimes if you tell somebody, "Listen, the average household spends $232
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:56.960]   a month on going out to eat," and you could drop that down considerably and just do little
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   things.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:04.280]   Maybe if you go out like we were right before we go to church on Wednesday nights to drop
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.000]   the kids off, we were doing that once a week.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.640]   Well, just like I had said before, that saved us $120 at the very least a month just doing
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.440]   one meal, taking one meal out and eating that at home.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.880]   And I think sometimes if you just tell people, "Oh, you need to stop eating out," I don't
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.160]   think that's really realistic.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.720]   You're going to have the times where you have a birthday party or you need to run out because
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.760]   something happens.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:40.120]   You need to still have that in your budget, but just to give your budget something realistic.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.680]   It's a realistic amount that you're going to stick to.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.800]   And if you look at it too where this is your overall food budget and this is how much you
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:57.600]   can spend on food, whether it be out to eat or at home, I think sometimes that gives you
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.400]   a little bit of motivation too.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:04.640]   What was that average dining out number you cited?
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.280]   I don't know that number.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.640]   What was it?
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:18.240]   The average household spends $232 a month, that's $2,700 a year, eating out, quick snacks,
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.240]   coffee.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.960]   Coffee is our biggest in our house.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.920]   That's our biggest thing.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.880]   If you looked at how much coffee we drink, you would understand why we are such happy
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.880]   people.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.960]   But yeah, I mean that's a huge difference.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:39.520]   The average household meal at home is only $10 and that's more than the average meal
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.600]   for one person out.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:48.720]   Restaurants are bumping whatever they spend on their food.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.520]   It's like three times that is how they come up with their number for how much to charge
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.520]   you.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.600]   How do you guys handle coffee expenses?
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.520]   What's your family routine?
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:08.320]   Well, it's kind of a treat for us now.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:17.160]   I do love a good coffee out but when I look at how much that coffee costs and how much
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:24.040]   we could save in a week, just doing that at home is so much cheaper.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.320]   So now it's kind of part of our date night routine.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.440]   That's kind of more of a special thing.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.920]   We don't get out much because we have four children.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:44.280]   So it's a treat when we do get to go drink coffee out.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.200]   One question about you mentioned that you recently, you were talking about how you recently
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.720]   made this transition to being a stay-at-home mom.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.840]   How has that affected your family's lifestyle?
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.160]   It's been a huge difference for us.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:12.040]   We had to be intentional about where we were spending our money.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:19.080]   It's hard sometimes to look at the budget and think, "Oh my, we cannot trim this down
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.040]   anymore than we already have."
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.080]   For us, it took a lot.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:34.960]   I kid you not when I tell you that I studied our budget for like a month and really looked
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.120]   at everything and said, "Okay, where can we cut out?
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.960]   What can we do differently?"
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.220]   For us, some of that was us eating at home.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.720]   We took out that Chick-fil-A night.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.920]   Kids were a little bit upset but they got over it.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:59.840]   The other things that we did was I went to go cancel our cable.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.560]   Our cable was like, "Well, hold on.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.800]   Why are you canceling?
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.600]   You've had us for three years."
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.080]   "Yep, you're right."
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.160]   They had bumped our price up over time as they do.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.920]   They said, "Is it the price?
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.560]   Because if it's the price, we can cut it in half."
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.840]   That was just out of a phone call.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.520]   All I did was try to cancel it and they cut it in half.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.880]   You're wishing you'd done it two years previously.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.880]   I know.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.520]   That's the thing.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.320]   It never occurred to me to do that before.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:42.120]   We have really had to look at our budget very differently and see what things could be taken
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.120]   out.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.520]   We do not live these just lavish lives.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.360]   We don't have car payments.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.640]   That can't be taken out.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.480]   You can't not take the kids to school one week to save the gas or something.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.320]   It has to be other things that you can do things about.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.120]   The other thing too is I really started shopping around for homeowner's insurance.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.400]   We own a home.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.640]   That was something else too that had never really occurred to me.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:20.800]   We just got the homeowner's insurance that we had always had and didn't ask questions
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   on how much it would cost anywhere else.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.760]   We ended up cutting that in half also by switching to a different company.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:36.480]   I just think that you have to be really intentional about looking at your budget.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.960]   It has to be an each month thing.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.180]   What can we do better with this next month?
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.440]   Can we cut something else out?
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:53.360]   One other idea, even eating at home, can you take meat out of one of your dinners one night?
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.160]   Just eat a meatless dinner.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   A lot of times they call them meatless Mondays.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.600]   Can you do something like that to even take your meal costs down?
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:09.080]   At our house, you'll see it a lot on the blog, we have what we call a family buffet night
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:15.280]   where we clean the whole refrigerator out of all of the leftovers that we've had.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:21.160]   You may get one spoonful of whatever, but a lot of times that's all you really want
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.440]   is just one spoonful.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.120]   "Just one more bite of that one meal.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.160]   It was so good the first time.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.840]   Let's just have one more bite."
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.880]   Those are the ways that we've done things around here.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.120]   I think that's really been very beneficial for us.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:45.920]   Any other resources, websites, blogs, books that you have found really inspirational in
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.200]   your learning?
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.160]   I would say my husband and I love Dave Ramsey.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.120]   I think who doesn't?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.400]   I think he has been very good.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:05.160]   We had gone through one of his books a couple years back and really felt like that was going
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.640]   to be the way that we needed to go.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:13.200]   I also follow MoneySavingMom.com.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:21.720]   She is very great at just coming out with out-of-the-box kind of things that maybe I
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.280]   hadn't thought about before.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:30.000]   I think that those two things, I would say, have been the most beneficial for our whole
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   process with this.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.440]   What have you learned from blogging?
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.440]   Blogging.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:43.960]   You're rolling in riches now because you started a blog, right?
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.200]   Not quite.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:55.840]   I would say blogging to me has really been kind of fun, to tell you the truth.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:04.000]   A lot of my friends have always thought that I was a bit crazy with my food.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.760]   I talk about it a lot on the blog.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:13.040]   I have become, I would say over the last year or so, I've become like the dessert person.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:21.000]   I don't know how that is, but I would say that I make almost one dessert for an event
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.280]   almost every week now.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:30.040]   Actually, I'm making two this weekend, so that should count for something.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.040]   I would say that's been kind of a thing.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.160]   That's also been a little bit of a challenge for me, too, because I'm trying to not make
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.840]   the same dessert over again for my women's Bible study.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:48.400]   I think that's kind of fun for me to try and come up with new things that I haven't made
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.200]   for them before or things that I think that they would like.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.520]   So I think that's been kind of fun.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:07.080]   I am not rolling in riches with the blogging, but I think in general it's just been fun
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.640]   just to kind of see how many recipes I've come up with.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:19.480]   I came up with close to 100 this past year to put on the blog, which is more than some
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.000]   people know altogether.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.360]   So I think that's kind of fun, kind of challenging to see when I'll run out.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.880]   Did you ever have a class in home economics in school?
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.240]   I did.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.520]   I was always really interested in that.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:42.440]   Actually, at the high school that I went to, they even had a restaurant class as well.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:50.320]   So I did that as well where we kind of did more of catering things.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.800]   So I think I've always kind of liked food.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.760]   I talk about food quite often, so it makes sense to write about it too.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:07.640]   It seems to me like a lot of what we talk about is the core foundation of home economics
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.400]   and of the skills of being a homemaker.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.880]   And it seems like very few people these days know anything about the skills of being a
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:22.520]   homemaker, but all these things that you describe are skills, are skills that can be learned
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:28.840]   and they're skills that we used to have classes on that these days have been, for the most
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:34.080]   part, disposed of in favor of more academic skills.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.880]   But I look at it and I say, "What makes a difference?"
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.600]   It makes a difference to be able to know how to shop for good deals.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.280]   It makes a difference to know how to repair something.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.160]   It makes a difference to be able to know how to do these basic things yourself and it makes
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.160]   a big difference in your family's budget.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.160]   Absolutely.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:57.440]   And I think, you know, who I call my littles on the blog are four years old and three years
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:06.520]   old and you teach them how to do fractions and things like that even at that age when
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.920]   they're helping make cookies and you're telling them it's a third a cup or a half a cup, you
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:20.080]   know, that was another way for me to kind of help even my fourth grader with fractions
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:25.400]   because fractions is one of the hardest things in school even now for teachers.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.560]   They say the same thing.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.600]   It's just hard to teach fractions.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.800]   And in recipes, that's a perfect example of how you can do that and they don't even know
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.400]   you're teaching them that.
