[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we're going to kick off another sponsor.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.160]   Sponsor of the day today is SoFi.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.000]   On today's show, we're going to hear an extensive interview with Dan Macklin, one of the co-founders
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   of SoFi.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.360]   I think you're really going to enjoy this.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.360]   SoFi is a unique new company that's trying to modernize the world of lending and they
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:41.320]   might be able to save you some money.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.280]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.040]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.040]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.040]   Today, I'm going to work to help you save some money.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.040]   Saving money is important.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.120]   Lowering costs is always a good thing.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.760]   And SoFi, I think, might be a way for some of you to do that.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.480]   Might be useful to those of you with student loans, might be useful to those of you with
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:13.640]   personal loans and maybe even to some of you who are taking out mortgages.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.520]   I first heard of SoFi, I was about to call it social finance, I think that's where the
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520]   name comes from.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.840]   I first heard of SoFi quite a while ago.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.240]   I pay attention a little bit to the world of online finance and started seeing this
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.480]   name SoFi crop up and the way that these things are usually launched as far as the world of
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.440]   online media and online financial blogging and things like that is it'll launch in the
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.040]   form of a review and usually that review leads to an advertisement or to an affiliate relationship,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.040]   things like that.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.440]   And so I started reading them and I started checking out the reviews and checking out
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.840]   the story and I was favorably impressed with a lot of the things that I saw.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.120]   And then a couple of months ago and I was up in Charlotte for FinCon 2015, I was able
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.720]   to connect with the guys there, meet them there face to face, talk with them and we
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.920]   struck up a deal where I decided that they would make a good fit for supportive radical
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.920]   personal finance.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.400]   If you're not familiar with SoFi, SoFi is a really interesting story.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.200]   I'm not going to spoil it here in the intro because you're going to hear the entire story
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.040]   right now in the interview that I'm about to play for you.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.160]   But SoFi might be a really good fit for some of you to be able to refinance your student
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   loans and gain the ability to cut your costs.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.280]   And as those of you who have seen the Building a Framework for Wealth presentation, which
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.000]   by the way, I often refer to these five points, ten words.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.760]   I haven't talked a lot about that on the show.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.800]   You can see it on the website or if you want the comprehensive overview, it's the presentation
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.920]   that I put out for all the patrons to see.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.120]   So if you're a patron of the show, one of your benefits is you get access to that presentation
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.920]   where I lay out the five-part framework for wealth.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.320]   But part number two is decrease expenses.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.600]   Anytime you can decrease expenses, that's always a good move, period.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.040]   And so especially when it comes to things like debt refinance, that can be really useful.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.720]   If you can decrease your expenses, that can be a good move.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.280]   So if you can cut interest rates, it's going to help you financially.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.120]   So sit back, relax, enjoy this interview with Dan Macklin, one of the co-founders of SoFi.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.920]   I think you're really going to enjoy it and it should provide some useful insight and
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.680]   I'll be back at the end to answer a couple of additional questions.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.800]   Dan, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   Joshua, great to be here.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.360]   So we're here today to introduce SoFi as a brand new sponsor of Radical Personal Finance
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.400]   and I'm excited about talking with you because you guys are making quite the press.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.000]   You've got quite the story and I think this will be a fun discussion.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.040]   I'd like you to start by sharing a little bit of your personal story as it relates to
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.040]   SoFi.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.360]   Walk us through your personal career journey and how that eventually led to your being
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.800]   involved with the founding of SoFi as a company.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   Okay.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.200]   So as you may be able to detect from my accent, I'm not from around these parts.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.920]   I'm from the UK.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.920]   You're from Alabama, right?
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.600]   I hear that Southern drawl.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.320]   Just east of Alabama somewhere.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.480]   And I worked for a big international bank, Standard Chartered Bank in the UK, Singapore
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.200]   and China for about 12 or 13 years.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   That was great.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.560]   And then I thought I'd like to get the US experience and do what effectively is a one-year
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.560]   MBA.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.880]   There's a course at Stanford that do full-time one-year MBAs for people with slightly more
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.700]   gray hair than the younger people doing the regular MBA.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.880]   So I fitted into the gray hair category, did that.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.000]   This is back in 2010 with the intention of having a nice year in California and then
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.040]   probably going back to Asia somewhere.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.000]   I was sponsored by my old bank.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.260]   But really fell in love with the place, Silicon Valley and the country at large and the opportunities
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.560]   that existed here and tried to come up with an excuse to stay.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.720]   By this time, I have a wife and two kids and we thought this is a nice place to bring up
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.480]   a family.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.160]   And fortunately, I got into a group with some of my classmates, including Mike Cagney,
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.600]   who is the CEO of SoFi.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.020]   And four of us, we came together and had some ideas for how we thought personal finance
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.800]   could be done a little bit differently.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.240]   And we had some ideas and then we thought, OK, why don't we make this into a company?
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.760]   So I resigned from my old bank back in April of 2011.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.720]   We graduated in late May, I think it was, on the Saturday and we started the company
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.620]   on the Monday.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.400]   So that was just a shade over four years ago and then it's been a fun ride since then.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.280]   So this is the quintessential Silicon Valley entrepreneur story.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.960]   What a cool background.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.160]   What was the market opportunity that you saw at that time that you guys wanted to exploit?
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.880]   OK, so I'll answer this in two ways.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.800]   I think at a very high level, we saw the financial services industry and all of us had come from
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.200]   that industry prior to going to Stanford.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.160]   We saw an industry that hadn't really changed, we didn't think, that much given the new technology
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.160]   that was available.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.920]   We were in a place surrounded by very cool companies doing very cool things.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.480]   And if you just think about what Apple and iTunes have done to music and Amazon has done
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.080]   to retail, the world of print media has been turned on its head.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.080]   All of these industries have been turned upside down and disrupted, whatever the word is you
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.240]   want to use.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.520]   But finance was still being done generally in much the same way.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.400]   Lots of intermediaries, lots of-- or a lack of transparency.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.360]   And at the end of it, you have people investing and not necessarily earning a great return
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.040]   or depositing money and not earning a great return.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.500]   And then banks lending that money at a much higher rate.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.840]   So we thought, why couldn't you put the users and the people that need the money closer
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.840]   together?
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.840]   And this was in the infancy of the peer-to-peer world.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.960]   So that was our kind of high-level vision.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.720]   But at a more ground-level view, we were at a place, one of the best schools in the country,
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.420]   depending on which ranking table you care to believe in.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.860]   And we saw that people were borrowing huge amounts of money to go to school.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.260]   And these were creditworthy people.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.420]   These were people that had great jobs prior to going to business school and the chances
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.900]   are would have great jobs after leaving business school.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.300]   Yet they were still borrowing at 7% or 8%.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.700]   So as we dug into it, because student lending was not an area that any of us had any expertise
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.940]   in prior to SoFi, but as we dug in, we realized that student loans and student lending in
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:45.460]   general was a huge industry, if you can call it that, over a trillion dollars second only
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.340]   behind mortgages in terms of debt in the US.
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:55.940]   And even despite this huge size of it, there were very few options for people to borrow.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.740]   Everyone was borrowing at the same rate, generally very bad levels of service.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.060]   And we just didn't understand why.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.620]   So that was the origins for the business.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.500]   And that's why we started SoFi and why our first product was in the student lending area.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.180]   Did it begin as a peer-to-peer product?
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.180]   It did.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.180]   It did.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.140]   So at the time, I'm sure some of your listeners are familiar with Prosper and Lending Club
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.260]   and these companies have gone on to grow very quickly in recent years.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260]   But back then in 2010, they were still at their infancy.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.380]   But there was this beginning of a peer-to-peer movement.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:39.820]   So our first fund, our pilot fund, if you like, we had 40 people, alumni from Stanford
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.660]   invest about $50,000 each.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.260]   So that created a $2 million pool.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.020]   And we then lent that money out to about 100 students at Stanford.
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.080]   So there was that peer-to-peer element.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.140]   Since then, we've moved, we've evolved a bit.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.860]   We take in institutional money as well as individuals, really just to allow us to scale,
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.460]   to keep up with the demand for the loans.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.180]   But back then, it was a little bit more of a pure peer-to-peer model.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:15.940]   So now, do you still allow individual investors to send money or has the peer-to-peer aspect
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.940]   gone away?
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.020]   No, we do.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.280]   So now, it's limited to accredited investors.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.980]   So it's not necessarily for everybody.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.780]   But for accredited investors, they can invest in the loans that we're making.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.260]   And there are details on our website.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:40.020]   It is, I'd be honest, the bulk of the money is coming from institutions.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.020]   But it's a mixture.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:46.380]   It's a mixture of money coming from big banks and pension funds and small banks and hedge
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.220]   funds, not-for-profits, as well as individuals.
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:56.660]   So the actual loan products, now who are you targeting currently in 2015?
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:02.860]   So now, in 2015, we've expanded from just being a student loan company to offering mortgages
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.540]   and personal loans as well.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.820]   So our customers now, we call them members.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.300]   We are adding about close to 10,000 customers, members, every month now.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:22.260]   And that's split across three primary products-- student loan refinancing, mortgages, including
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.840]   new purchase and refinancing, and personal loans.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.900]   So across those three products, we're bringing close to 10,000 people every month who are
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.100]   enjoying significant savings and getting great service.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.300]   Still those student loans are the biggest percentage of your business?
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.020]   What's the makeup of the loans that you're writing in terms of different channels?
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.020]   Yeah, they are.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.420]   So at the beginning of the year, it was almost 100% student lending.
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.620]   And now, recording this, we're in October.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.460]   And we just finished September.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:59.580]   In September, about 60% of our loan volume, which was close to $500 million just in the
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:05.780]   month of September, about 60% was student loan refinancing in its various forms.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.560]   40% was mortgages and personal loans combined.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.460]   But they're fast catching up.
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:17.240]   So by the end of the year, we think student lending will be dipping below 50%.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.500]   One of the challenges is there seems to be various places that you can get money.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:28.580]   What in your mind or in your business plan documents, what's the competitive differentiator?
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.100]   What makes you different from other lending institutions?
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.740]   Good question.
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.500]   There's a few things.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.700]   I think at the heart of lending money, you have to have great rates.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.420]   So you can have the best service in the world and the slickest website, but ultimately,
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.360]   you got to have competitive rates.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.060]   So I think that's very important.
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:55.060]   And if we talk about student loan refinancing, our customers are coming to us paying about
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.100]   7% or 8% on average.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.340]   And they're bringing those rates down to 3%, 4%, or 5%.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:07.620]   They're refinancing around $75,000, which means they're saving around $14,000 on average.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.140]   Many are saving $20,000 or $30,000 or even more.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.940]   So that's probably the primary reason why somebody is coming to us, because of those
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:17.940]   savings.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.940]   I think that that's not the only thing.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:26.700]   You have to have an easy and intuitive experience, application experience, to allow people to
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.700]   get through.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.700]   People are busy.
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.380]   Even if you dangle a carat of $20,000 of savings, they still have to get there.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.980]   They still have to get through your process.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.700]   So we've put a lot of work into making our online application as quick and simple as
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.180]   we can.
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.540]   So you don't have to speak to a soul if you don't want to.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.020]   You can do everything online.
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.780]   You can take photos of your ID and upload that.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:54.240]   You don't have to fax or Xerox or physically mail us anything.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.020]   But alongside that technology exists real human beings sitting here in California, actually
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.300]   in the wine country.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.420]   We think happy people make for happy customers.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.380]   And it's bearing fruit, no pun intended.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:13.580]   So we have people at the end of the phone who can help you through if you have any questions.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:19.940]   So it's that mixture of technology but also real people on the end of the phone.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:27.660]   Why are you willing and able to lend money at 3 to 5% if the market rate is 7 to 8%?
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.340]   Well the truth is the market rate isn't 7 to 8%.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.460]   I guess it depends what you call market rate.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.940]   The existing rate they're paying is 7 to 8% because that was pretty much the only option
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.300]   they had when they took those loans.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.300]   But the market rate for this individual now is the rate that we're charging them, the
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.020]   3 to 5%.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.900]   Because these people have graduated, they have a job, they have an income, they have
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.580]   some kind of credit history.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.200]   They shouldn't be paying 8%.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:59.060]   So that is why we are able to charge them a lower rate.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.140]   So then where's the profit incentive for the investor?
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.540]   If the maximum rate, I don't know what the maximum rates are that you're charging, is
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:11.260]   3 to 5%, why would I, if I were an accredited investor, why would I be interested in investing
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:17.820]   through SoFi when there's not so much profit there at that 3 to 5% rate?
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.340]   So sure, the rates are lower than they could be.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:29.340]   But the truth is the credit quality of our customer base is extremely strong.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:36.300]   So now I think we've just gone above 60,000 customers and of those customers only 5 of
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.620]   them have defaulted on their loans.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:45.540]   And of those 5, 4 of them unfortunately passed away and we have a provision in our loan agreement
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.660]   that says if you pass away we'll wipe the debt.
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.900]   So if you exclude those people there's only really one person who's willfully defaulted
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.100]   if that's the right expression.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:03.820]   So it's a very strong book credit wise, financially speaking, of customers.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:08.140]   And therefore that, obviously we have to do a good job and continue to underwrite and
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.500]   approve people in that same manner.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.660]   And let's hope the economy – we're doing well.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.640]   The number of people that have defaulted is extremely low.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.720]   So even though the rates they're paying are relatively low, investors can still get a
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.540]   return given those very low levels of default.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.940]   How do you screen for applicants?
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:36.340]   Is it based on which school and you're a Stanford graduate and you've got an MBA so therefore
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:42.860]   in theory you have better job prospects than Joe Sixpack who just got a basic degree at
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.740]   the local community college or is it based on something different?
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.620]   How do you actually maintain those high levels of repayment?
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:56.860]   It's based on many different factors but the most important one is what we call free
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.420]   cash flow.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:05.020]   And what that boils down to is do you have enough money at the end of the month to pay
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.500]   your obligations including this loan?
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:13.020]   So that is driven by a combination of your salary or different forms of income that you
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.940]   have and then some sense for your general cost of living.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:22.620]   If you have different mortgage payments or whatever you have that have to go out, then
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.220]   we'll look at that.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.100]   So it's not driven from your credit score.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.980]   We do look at your credit history to see that you've been paying your bills on time and
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.380]   you haven't been bankrupt in the last couple of years for example.
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:42.220]   But the actual score itself is an extremely low determinant in working out whether we
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.860]   approve you.
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.260]   And then we do look at your school but more importantly really is your occupation.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.780]   So if you're in an industry that has very low levels of unemployment then that counts
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.780]   in your favor.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:59.620]   Nurses for example, there's a shortage of nurses in many cities in the US.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:05.580]   So if you're a nurse and you live in whatever city you do, then it's very difficult for
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.580]   you to be unemployed.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.660]   You have to be really bad at your job to be unemployed.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.980]   So we look at those kinds of things.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:18.700]   Obviously some industries fare better than others and all of those things combined allow
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.420]   us to make the decision as to whether we can approve you.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.260]   But we do approve more than 50% of the people that apply to us.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:32.020]   So it's a high bar but it's not unobtainable.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.220]   Who are your major competitors in this space?
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.380]   So this is a great question and I always struggle on how to answer it because we were the first
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.980]   company to refinance federal and private loans together.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.900]   So before we were doing it, there was no one doing it.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.900]   So in that sense, there wasn't any competition.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:56.180]   And since then, there have been some other companies coming in having similar business
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.860]   models and there are earlier stages but they're still doing something similar.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.900]   Obviously in mortgages, there's a lot more competition.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.720]   It's a very crowded market and personal lending as well.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.560]   It's a much more crowded market.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.900]   But I still believe and the answer I give to this question is that our biggest competition
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.260]   is lack of awareness.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.620]   I don't mean that to be glib but I say it because there are millions of people out there
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:28.420]   with debt of one form or another who could save money and could save money by coming
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.420]   to SoFi.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:34.180]   And it isn't that they're necessarily being competed for or we're not competing with lots
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.500]   of people to find them.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.100]   We just need to do a better job to make them aware.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.980]   So there are other players in the industry but more than anything, student loan refinancing,
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.900]   there's 40 million plus people with student debt.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:53.540]   I don't know how many million of them could refinance but it is millions of them and we
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.620]   only have a tiny fraction of that today.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.620]   Well done.
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:00.300]   That's an elegant answer to respond to an interview question.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.300]   What are your major weaknesses?
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.180]   Well, let me tell you a story about a weakness that's a strength.
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.180]   Well done, Dan.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.180]   I like the answer.
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.180]   Thank you.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:15.500]   On the mortgage market, do you offer – so clearly, the rates that we're talking about
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.020]   would relate to student loans.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:25.860]   What is your drive or your competitive differentiation from the perspective of mortgages?
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.660]   A couple of things here.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.420]   We started the mortgage product because our member base was telling us that they needed
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.800]   help with mortgages.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.740]   So these were lots of people that had recently come out of graduate school, undergraduate
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:46.500]   school, trending in their late 20s, early 30s, looking to buy their first home.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.300]   And they were creditworthy people because that's who SoFi customers are but the reason
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.500]   they hadn't been able to buy their first home was because they couldn't find a down
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.500]   payment.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.500]   Typically, most lenders are requiring 20%.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:06.620]   And if they can get away with less than 20%, they'd be stuck with huge mortgage insurance,
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.620]   PMI.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.100]   So we looked at it and we didn't think that that needed to be the case.
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.020]   So we came up with a mortgage where you only have to put 10% down.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.780]   The minimum is a 10% down payment.
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:22.140]   And importantly, there's no mortgage insurance on top of that.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:27.700]   So what we've allowed is many people that have otherwise been priced out of the market
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:34.020]   who otherwise would have to wait three or four years to save up that down payment, they've
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.260]   been able to come in and take a mortgage and buy a home sooner than they otherwise would.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:44.340]   So that's one of the big differentiators that we have versus the competition.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.220]   So it sounds like you're competing more based upon product design and appealing to a certain
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:57.660]   set of borrowers versus necessarily a real advantage in interest rates or a real advantage
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.660]   in an even process.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.900]   Although, I'm sure your process is much more elegant coming from Silicon Valley rather
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.620]   than Indiana.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.900]   But it sounds like you're primarily just focusing on a different segment.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.780]   I mean, there's not a real huge saving.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.460]   I'm sure your mortgage rates are simply competitive.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.460]   Is that accurate?
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.500]   No, they are.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:22.580]   So what I mentioned was for a certain demographic of people, but you hit it on the nail there,
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.420]   Joshua, in terms of the service.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.740]   Many people at SoFi had been through the mortgage experience ourselves with other lenders.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.580]   And I don't think any of us were willing to tell our friends about it because it was very
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.340]   painful and long.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.900]   And what we're trying to do at SoFi is shorten that and make it easier.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.780]   And a real example of that is you can take out your phone now.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:48.900]   You can apply for a SoFi mortgage in 90 seconds and be approved with a customized rate for
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.900]   you.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:55.060]   And you can dial up using your finger on your phone the amount of down payment and see how
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.700]   that affects your rate.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.660]   Obviously, as the down payment goes up, the rate can go down.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:05.860]   But that kind of instantaneous decisioning is just not provided elsewhere.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.580]   People have to apply and wait in many cases weeks for a bank to come back and say you've
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.860]   been approved.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.420]   So the process is extremely important to us.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.500]   The number of days that people are in the process is very important to us.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.500]   And that's, again, another big differentiator.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.580]   And on the pricing, obviously, we have to be extremely competitive.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:32.460]   But we're particularly competitive for the people that have only 10% to put down because
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.340]   there's a real lack of options out there.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:39.060]   But also on the refinancing side, if you have a decent amount of equity in your home already,
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.060]   then we're extremely, extremely competitive.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.700]   I have a so-fi mortgage, so I can speak from the heart on this one.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.700]   Nice.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:51.220]   Now, it's definitely the mortgage industry in many ways does seem to be-- it seems to
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.560]   be slow to have accepted and brought in innovation.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.460]   When you think back and look at the background of it, me going through the process a few
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.900]   years ago, it's really frustrating.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.700]   And the challenge is when you're working with an individual, how do you assure that you're
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.060]   getting the best scenario, the best product?
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:13.220]   I still see-- I know some companies are offering competitive illustrations, but I still see
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:18.860]   the value of somebody bringing more transparency to the market so people can be confident that
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.700]   they're getting the best choice.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.620]   It's a challenging market, so I'm glad to see you bringing some competition there.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:32.460]   I'm interested, Dan, in what you've learned as far as your entrepreneurial story over
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.460]   the last five years.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:40.700]   What's been the growth rate as far as employees and what's been the experience like in five
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.100]   years of running a Silicon Valley startup?
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.980]   It's been great.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.860]   It's the first startup I've been involved with.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:52.660]   My previous company had 80,000 people, so a very different type of company.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.060]   And obviously, there are challenges that come with that.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.820]   There's a lot of uncertainty at the beginning.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.620]   When you start, you don't really know where your customers are going to come from.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.780]   You don't know where the funding is going to come from.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:09.740]   You're not quite sure if the business model is good enough and works.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:15.060]   So that's a challenge, but that's what you get when you start a new company.
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:19.940]   And we've been fortunate enough to grow pretty quickly.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.140]   So in terms of people, we're now up to over 400 people.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.300]   I think we'll be at 500 by the end of the year and probably by the end of next year,
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.060]   something like 1,500.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:36.820]   And I think the loan growth that we've experienced so far gives you an idea of the growth.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:41.820]   So if you just indulge me for a second, it took us, I think, three years to lend our
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.820]   first billion dollars.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.540]   So we got to a billion dollars after three years.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.700]   And then each subsequent billion dollars has taken a much quicker amount of time to get
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.700]   to.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.700]   So we got to two billion.
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.060]   I think it took another five months.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.020]   Three billion, it took another four months.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.180]   Four billion, it took another three months.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.260]   And we're just about to hit five billion, which will be that last billion will be in
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.340]   just over two months.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.620]   So it's a real rapid growth.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.300]   Most of that growth has come during this calendar year, 2015.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   And I think that's the really fun thing about building a business.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.820]   It's tough at the beginning, but you get to some level, some level of scale.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:23.180]   And then I wouldn't say it just happens because it doesn't just happen, but you got the infrastructure
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.740]   set up and you can just do a lot more and help a lot more people.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:35.700]   Would I be correct in guessing that your equity stake in SoFi would be the largest
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.060]   value asset on your personal balance sheet at this point?
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.060]   Yes.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.660]   Yes, by a considerable way.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.100]   So feel free to be circumspect about numbers.
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.100]   And I know you're in a difficult situation running a company.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:53.060]   I'm not asking for any particulars, but I would like you to comment on this theme.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.700]   On radical personal finance, I talk a lot about entrepreneurship as simply being flat
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:03.820]   out the best potential investment for any person who's interested in building wealth.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:08.620]   And you come from the finance background, the banking background, depending on what
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:13.220]   aspect of the finance world you're in, you're accustomed at some level looking for good
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.220]   investments.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:22.140]   You chose to get an MBA at Stanford, which has a unique educational program there, has
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.660]   a unique culture with being there in Silicon Valley, and you've chosen to live in a unique
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.140]   part of the world.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.820]   And it seems like it's in the process of working out well for you.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.700]   From a risk-reward standpoint, it would seem like your risk, your personal risk – and
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.060]   I don't know how much money you put in, and again, feel free to say or not to say,
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.780]   but your personal risk was relatively low.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.620]   You were investing a lot of energy and hard work in an idea, and your personal return
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.140]   at this point seems like it's on track to be pretty substantial.
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:54.020]   Talk about the process of wealth creation through entrepreneurship and what you've
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.700]   learned by pursuing this path.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.700]   Sure.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.380]   So, I mean, a couple of points.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.980]   We're just starting here, so we're doing well, but we have a long way to go.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:09.980]   So I don't want anybody to think that we've done it and we've succeeded because we're
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.620]   doing well, but we have a lot more to do.
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.460]   There's a lot more people out there that need our help.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:20.940]   But coming back to your question, it was a very tough decision because I was being sponsored
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.460]   by my old company and I had a job to go back to.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:32.180]   I was living a nice expatriate life in Asia with my home paid for, my kids schooling,
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.420]   and health care and all that stuff.
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:40.820]   So to give that up for what was essentially just an idea, a PowerPoint deck, was a really
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.820]   tough thing.
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:47.460]   And as soon as I tell this story to lots of people, but that resignation email was the
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.860]   most expensive email I sent because as soon as I resigned from my previous employer, I
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.780]   had to pay them back for the education that they were paying for.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:28:01.020]   And I was giving up all kinds of equity and bonuses and stuff that I was no longer eligible
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.420]   for as a non-employee.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.940]   So that was a very expensive decision.
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:13.340]   So looking back on it, in some ways I'm surprised that I made it because the chances of a new
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.260]   company succeeding are very low.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.580]   Most startups fail.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.820]   That's just the way it works.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.660]   So I'm looking back, I'm pleased I made the decision, but I wouldn't necessarily say it
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:33.660]   was obviously the right decision for anybody at that time.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.020]   But it was the right thing for me and I'm very happy with that decision.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:45.180]   - Did you and your initial founding partners, did you guys fund the enterprise yourself
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:51.060]   or did you, as far as in the initial stages, or did you work to bring in investors from
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.060]   the early stages?
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.900]   - We did work to bring in investors fairly quickly.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:01.380]   So there were a few months where we weren't really being paid anything, but we weren't
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.980]   necessarily putting our own money into it.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.020]   It was more equity.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.620]   But that was a relatively short period.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:14.340]   We had the advantage of coming out of Stanford where we incubated the company effectively
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.400]   that we got to interact with lots of potential investors.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.460]   So fairly quickly after we graduated, we raised a round of financing.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.640]   It took a few months, but it wasn't a lifetime.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.220]   And then with that, we had some funding.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.220]   Even though we weren't paying ourselves salaries that we would otherwise be earning, we weren't
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.540]   going too far into the red every month.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:41.940]   - Could you have started SoFi or a similar type of company if you hadn't been involved
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:47.780]   in the Stanford program or if you hadn't been in Silicon Valley?
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.240]   - So hypothetically, yes.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.340]   It wasn't that the only people that could start a student loan refinancing business had
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.140]   to be in Silicon Valley or Stanford.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:03.700]   But practically, I wasn't in the US.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.700]   I was in China.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:09.020]   I wouldn't have come up with an idea for a US company and been able to move here and
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.380]   do it.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:16.980]   And I think the university environment, certainly Stanford Business School, fosters that collaboration
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.020]   and people coming up with ideas.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.180]   And we had a year really to work on something.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.580]   I think that's tough if you're doing a nine to five job and you have demands on your time
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.540]   through your family or whatever else you have in your life.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.340]   It's really tough then to get a few people to sit together and create a business.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.840]   And I think business school gives you that opportunity.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.140]   So it's not the only place it could have happened.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.020]   But for me, it wouldn't have happened unless I'd gone there.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.780]   I wouldn't have met my co-founders for one thing.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:49.820]   So that's, Stanford was instrumental in SoFi taking off.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.580]   - What was the most valuable aspect of the MBA?
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:31:03.740]   - I think it really is, for me, it was coming to a place and learning about a completely
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.620]   different world that I had been exposed to.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:13.820]   So I'd been more of a corporate nine to five kind of job, not nine to five hours, but salary,
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.500]   you get what I mean.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:20.860]   Whereas you come to Silicon Valley and San Francisco and everywhere around here, and
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.900]   almost everybody's involved in a new company.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.020]   So I think it just spreads that can-do attitude.
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.860]   We used to have people coming into classes, talking about their experience and how they'd
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.300]   built companies.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.660]   Many had succeeded, some hadn't succeeded.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.260]   But there was definitely an element of me thinking, well, if they can do it, why can't
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.940]   I?
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.700]   And there's an infrastructure to raise money.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.340]   There's an infrastructure to find employees.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.620]   People don't look at you as a brand new company that isn't making money and say, well, that's
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.620]   a bit strange.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.460]   That's a bit weird.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.500]   Because that's the norm here.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:32:00.780]   So I think just being in that environment was hugely beneficial for me.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:05.700]   Do you consider moving out of Silicon Valley or taking your company out of Silicon Valley?
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:11.980]   So we have offices, SoFi has offices now in five or six cities around the US.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:21.460]   So we only have about a quarter of our employees now actually in Silicon Valley or in San Francisco.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.660]   Everybody else is in different places around the US.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:31.660]   So the heart of the company is still here, but we're spreading our tentacles around the
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.980]   country.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.940]   What's the strategy behind that decision?
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.340]   I mean, a few things.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:44.140]   There are great employees in many places around the US and we don't necessarily just need
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.420]   to be hiring here.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:52.100]   From an operations perspective, there are advantages in having different operations
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:58.740]   units in different places in case of catastrophe or power outages or something.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.780]   You don't want to have all your eggs in one basket.
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:08.340]   We have our legal team out in DC where they're closer to some of the regulatory stuff that's
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.340]   happening.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:19.980]   So we have engineers in Montana, which is slightly less competitive than hiring engineers
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.980]   in San Francisco.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.780]   So there are lots of reasons why we're in different cities around the US.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:31.620]   Do you think being involved as a founder, and I know I'm asking you personal questions,
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:36.900]   feel free again to evade the question if you need to.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:43.580]   The journey of the entrepreneur, the journey of the last five years, have you enjoyed the
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.860]   journey?
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.780]   Are you enjoying it because of the goal?
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.940]   Is it more about the process of creation?
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.300]   Is it more about the money?
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.900]   What are you finding being involved kind of at the tip of the tiger, whatever the appropriate
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.740]   metaphor is, with just a massively growing company?
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:06.820]   What's been the real joy and what's been the real challenges as a founding member?
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.420]   So it's been really great.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:13.500]   I've been extremely fortunate that I think we came up with an idea that was at exactly
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.820]   the right time.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.900]   We were in the right place at the right time.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.420]   And there's a lot of luck involved in that.
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:24.820]   There's a lot of hard work and sweat and everything else, but there is an element of
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.820]   luck.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:32.940]   We formed the company at a time that we were probably two years, two, three years out of
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.980]   the worst element of the Great Recession.
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:39.740]   So people had started to invest again, but there still wasn't that much going on.
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:45.180]   Banks were still relatively reticent to get back into lending, and they continue to be
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.260]   really even today.
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:50.660]   So we've had this four-year period where I don't think you could have picked a better
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:54.600]   time to launch this business.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.760]   So that's been in our favor, but obviously there's a lot of hard work that goes along
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.100]   with that.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.580]   So I'm extremely pleased with the decision we made.
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.580]   It's a tough ride.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.420]   There are ups and downs.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.820]   As long as you're trending upwards, eventually that's the main thing.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:15.240]   But within that, that kind of disguises lots of daily ups and downs.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.240]   So it's not for everybody.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.180]   I tell this to people who are considering it.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:24.580]   It's not for everybody because if you don't like uncertainty, then you shouldn't join
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.140]   a new company.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.540]   You shouldn't start a new company because it's uncertain.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.860]   And some people thrive on that and some people don't.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:39.180]   And it's tough to know until you do it, but you have to go with your gut instinct, I think.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.180]   It's funny.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:47.140]   I feel sometimes when talking about entrepreneurship, I've got my own tiny little startup and I'm
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:51.100]   not trying to duplicate any kind of the scale of a technology company the way that you guys
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.100]   are.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.500]   But I generally discourage people from doing what I'm doing.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:59.100]   And one of the reasons that I discourage people is, number one, it's so difficult that if
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:05.180]   you don't really want it or you don't really have a clear vision, you're not going to follow
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.180]   through.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:11.460]   And I basically assume that the ones who should follow my advice to walk away and not do what
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:15.100]   I'm doing or not follow entrepreneurship, they'll get discouraged.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:20.620]   And the ones who have the tenacity to follow through will just simply ignore the advice.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.540]   And it seems even in what you're saying, I hear the same thing.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.580]   And I hear it as a constant theme with entrepreneurs.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.900]   It seems like most entrepreneurs discourage other people from doing what they're doing,
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:34.340]   knowing that the ones who probably should do what they're doing will just simply ignore
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.020]   their advice and do it anyway.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.020]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.900]   I think there's a lot of truth in that.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:39.900]   It's difficult.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.980]   So unless you really, really want to do it, it's probably not the thing for you because
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.900]   there are obstacles along the way.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:52.260]   And unless you have a real passion for it, then it's going to be tough.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.100]   But just going back to your question, Joshua, I think one of the things I'm really enjoying
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:02.180]   now is we're getting to the scale and my role at the company now, I'm getting to meet face
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.620]   to face a lot of our members.
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.420]   We go around the country and host events and just get to interact.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.460]   And there's not really an agenda there.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.780]   There's no sales pitch.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:16.340]   We just want to get to know them better and have a chance to say thank you.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:21.380]   And it's really powerful once you meet people and see how you're changing their lives.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.820]   We have the benefit of dealing with financial products that have a huge role in people's
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.820]   lives.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.940]   If you can refinance their student debt and save them $20,000, that's big.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.500]   And there's great stories.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:40.180]   Just last week, I was at a dinner and there was a couple there who didn't feel like they
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.260]   could start a family because they didn't feel like they had their personal finances in order.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:48.540]   They refinanced with SoFi, saved lots of money, got their finances in order, and now they're
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:53.820]   going through the adoption process because they believe that they've got things under
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.420]   control at home.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.980]   And I think when you meet people like that and you hear stories like that, it's great.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:04.060]   It's moving because you're now changing people's lives in a very meaningful way.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.740]   So that was always the intention and it takes a while to get there.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:10.820]   But now we're doing that each and every day and that means a lot to us.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.680]   That's really special.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.380]   Two final questions, Dan, and we're done.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:22.220]   Number one, I'm interested in your perspective from an insider's view, coming from an outsider
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:27.780]   from the UK, from Asia, coming in and then trying to understand and deal within the US
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.980]   financial regulatory environment.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.180]   You have different state laws.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.340]   You're working with different products.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:36.780]   Some are regulated at the national level, some at the local level.
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:42.180]   What's your overall perspective on the US financial regulatory framework?
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.980]   What's been your experience working within it?
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.020]   Okay, so first of all, disclaimer, I'm no expert on this.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:52.900]   We have very well qualified and well paid legal experts in the SoFi team that handle
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.900]   most of this stuff.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:00.100]   But what I would say is the – I mean, there has to be regulation.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.420]   There has to be regulation in finance because it's such an important industry and you
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:09.980]   can't have people just investing in anything and losing all their money because the economy
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.260]   and people's lives are at stake.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:18.140]   I think sometimes that regulation can get in the way of innovation.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.460]   We are trying to – we are not a bank.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.080]   We are a non-bank lender.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.840]   So we have licenses in each state in which we lend and we have to obtain those licenses
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.820]   for every lending product that we wish to offer.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.900]   And mortgages, for example, is a tougher license to get in some of the states.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.380]   So it just takes longer to get them.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:44.060]   And while we understand that, it's frustrating when you have people that want to use your
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.220]   product but they happen to live in the wrong state and can't use your product.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:55.500]   So we work very closely with the regulators to make sure that we're obviously fully compliant.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:01.780]   But just that, those differences across states, it makes it a little bit wonky in your offering
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:06.060]   because you can't offer the same things to all people on your website.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:11.700]   Do you find the regulatory environment to be tilted at all in favor of the big dogs,
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:17.180]   the large financial institutions that are already covering the market?
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:21.020]   That's a tough one.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.980]   I think if you look at the number of new companies that have started in the finance area, particularly
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:32.060]   in the last five years, SoFi included, it's really heating up now.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.060]   There are lots of new players coming in.
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:41.100]   And in general, we have very supportive and great relationships with the regulators.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.300]   So no, I wouldn't be able to say that.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:49.100]   I think there's a lot of thirst for innovation and new ideas and competition, which I think
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.100]   is great.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.100]   Last question.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:55.060]   You've talked, here's your softball.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:01.380]   Go through, and in a moment after the interview, I'll go through the Radical Personal Finance,
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:05.340]   SoFi relationship in detail, all the terms of the offers that we'll be making.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:11.140]   But talk through who would you like to see research SoFi to see if SoFi can help them
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.620]   save money and who would you want to steer away as far as we're going to guess that if
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.660]   you're in this situation, we probably wouldn't be able to serve you the best.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:25.860]   So in general, it's creditworthy people, which is a fairly vague statement.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.260]   But if you have, looking at student loans, if you have student loan debt and you're paying
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:35.540]   north of 5% on it, then there's a very real chance that we can save you money by refinancing
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.540]   that debt.
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:41.340]   Mortgages, if you're looking to buy a home for the first time, particularly if you don't
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:47.780]   have 20% down payment, we offer great rates and offer the ability for that 10% down payment
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.780]   option.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.220]   And then personal loans, we haven't spoken too much about that.
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:56.780]   But if you have any kind of credit card debt that's north of 10%, then our personal loan
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.900]   rates are in the 5% to 10% range.
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:05.140]   There's no reason to be paying 15% interest on a credit card if you can pay 7% through
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.900]   a personal loan.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:14.100]   So creditworthy people, people who are employed, people that have good credit histories, you
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.100]   should check us out.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.500]   And there are no commitments for any of our products.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:23.260]   There's no origination fees or funny fees lurking in the background.
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.420]   And when you apply, you're not committing yourself to anything.
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.020]   So have a look.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.020]   Have a look.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.020]   See what you think.
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:34.460]   But many, many thousands of people are applying every day.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:39.620]   And we've funded now over close to $5 billion in most of that this year.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.460]   So the word is spreading.
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:45.140]   But I'm always eager to make sure that there are more people out there that get a good
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.380]   deal when they can get one.
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.220]   Dan, thanks for coming on.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.220]   Where do you want people if they want to connect with you personally?
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.780]   Do you keep a blog, a company blog, Twitter?
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.460]   Where would you like people to connect with you?
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.300]   We do have a company blog and I write on that.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.860]   So Twitter, the handle is @macklindan.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.860]   I'm just starting.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.740]   I'm a newbie at Twitter but I'm making decent progress.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.620]   Dan, thanks for coming on.
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.140]   Joshua, thank you.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.020]   If you would like to try out SoFi, I have a tracking link.
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:19.820]   And the way that you can use my tracking link so that I get credit for your actions is to
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:23.100]   go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi.
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.940]   That's S-O-F-I, short for social finance.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.500]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:35.060]   The benefit of using that link is if you use that referral code, which automatically works
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:41.260]   if you go through that link, you will save $200 on the refinance of your student loans
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:44.540]   and $100 on the refinance of any personal loans.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:49.060]   So if you execute a personal loan with them, they'll give you $100 in your account and
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.660]   $200 on your student loans.
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:54.260]   Then I also receive a commission if you use that tracking link, which I would say thank
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.260]   you for.
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.860]   That's very useful and helpful to me and to the show.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.420]   So you can find that link at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.900]   I'm not going to belabor with details here, although of course if you have additional
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.140]   details I'd be happy to answer them.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:09.940]   The one thing I want to mention to you is those of you who are familiar with some of
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:14.620]   the other sponsors of the show know that we have a sponsor named Jay Fleischman.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:19.020]   Jay is a student loan attorney, and I have recommended that if you have student loans
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.100]   that you meet with Jay.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.860]   Just because SoFi is on here doesn't mean that I've changed that recommendation.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:24.860]   I mean it.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.020]   I sincerely recommend that you meet with Jay.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:30.860]   I was on the phone with somebody earlier today and I told him, "You need to call Jay Fleischman.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.860]   You have student loans.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:32.860]   Why haven't you called Jay yet?
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.860]   Do you not do what I tell you on the show?"
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.060]   I said it nicely, but that was the point.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.900]   I said call Jay.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:43.660]   The point is that refinancing student loans can be a very good thing to do.
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:47.140]   However, there are some reasons why you shouldn't, and how are you going to know whether you
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.140]   should just refinance directly or not?
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.340]   Well, you're going to get advice.
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.340]   Call Jay.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.340]   So that is the key.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.940]   Call Jay, and then if the best thing for you to do is just to refinance your student loans
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.900]   and you can do that and cut back your interest rates and improve your terms, then Jay will
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.720]   be the one to tell you that and he will recommend that.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.660]   He is a fan of SoFi and he will recommend that you do that if that is right for you.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:12.860]   So your best method of procedure here is call Jay or better – sorry, not call.
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.540]   Go to studentloanshow.com/radical.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.380]   Studentloanshow.com/radical.
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:20.740]   That will take you through to Jay Fleischman who is a sponsor of the show.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:25.380]   And then after reviewing your situation with Jay, then check into refinancing your student
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.700]   loans with SoFi or again if you have personal debt or perhaps some of you might be able
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.980]   to use their mortgage services as well.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.700]   And if you'd like to do that, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/sofi.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:35.700]   That's it.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:40.220]   That's all I wanted to cover for today's show.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.820]   Sorry if my timing in these intros and outros is a little bit off, feeling a little bit
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.940]   under the weather today, but I wanted to make sure to get the show out for you.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.260]   I thank each and every one of you who listens.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.140]   If you are listening to this in the current week, it is Thanksgiving week in the United
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.140]   States.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.260]   The show is going out on November 23, 2015.
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.980]   So here on Thanksgiving week, happy Thanksgiving.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.740]   I'll be releasing a number of shows for you and then we'll have a little break
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:04.860]   at the end of the week for Thanksgiving as we wind into the holiday season.
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:08.340]   I hope that 2015 has treated you well.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.900]   2015 has definitely treated me well.
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:15.020]   But I'm even more excited about 2016 than I am about 2015.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.180]   Lots of big changes coming.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.020]   So I hope the content has been useful.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:22.060]   I hope that it has gotten increasingly better and more useful for you.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.700]   Thank each and every one of you who listens.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.940]   Special thanks to those of you who support the show on Patreon.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:31.860]   That is the system where if you want to support the show directly, you can do so by patronizing
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:32.860]   our advertisers.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.860]   That's helpful.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.420]   Or if you want to skip the advertiser route or if you just find value in the content and
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.580]   you'd like to tell me that, then send me some money on Patreon.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.980]   The way you do that is go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:44.980]   Sign up to support the show.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.340]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron can be as little as a buck a month, as much as a
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.540]   couple hundred bucks a month.
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.600]   Various benefits there.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.660]   One of the benefits that you may enjoy is there is a presentation there.
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:58.360]   It's about a 25-minute video presentation.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.980]   At any level of support, even at a buck a month, you will gain access to that presentation.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:07.400]   And that will lay out for you the framework for wealth, which is basically in some ways
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.100]   is the broad outline of the book that I'm working on and this broad outline of everything
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.620]   I know about finance fits into that outline.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.980]   And so you can see that's one of the benefits of becoming a patron.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:20.860]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and you will find all of those details.
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.100]   Until tomorrow, thank you all so much for being here.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:52.260]   Appreciate each and every one of you.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.300]   Let's see what AI knows about football.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.740]   Hey, chatbot, should I bet on my team to win the big game this year?
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:03.100]   Bet on Valley High Toyota to get you a great deal on a new 2023 Toyota.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.100]   What?
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.260]   I'm talking about football, not a new car.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.060]   Well, your team is trash and will never make it.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.740]   Save your money and spend it on the car you need.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.740]   Ouch.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:17.180]   Score big on a new 2023 Toyota this season at Valley High Toyota.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.660]   It's way easier than you think.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.160]   (upbeat electronic music)
