[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.160]   Remember, Jack Bogle, you get what you don't pay for.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.880]   It's true.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.920]   So I want to convince you of two things.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.720]   Get real, and arithmetic still works.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.040]   Now, for get real, which is better,
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   earning 10% when inflation is 12%
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.040]   or earning 3% when inflation is 2%?
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.120]   Which do you think makes people happier?
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.960]   We like to see the balance go up even if the spending
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.040]   power is going down.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.640]   So stocks-- this is all speculative,
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.120]   but stocks may have a real inflation-adjusted return
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.480]   of, let's say, 5% annually.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.920]   High-quality bonds, maybe 1%.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.120]   So that means a 50/50 portfolio might, in the long run,
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.600]   beat inflation by 3%.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.560]   So how much of it do you want to give away?
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.160]   Now, I ran something by Mike Piper
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.120]   on a spreadsheet last night, but I should have run this by--
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.600]   3 minus 2 does equal 1, right?
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.520]   Mike agrees.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.680]   He's nodding.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.120]   So the most brilliant paper you'll ever read
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.320]   is three pages and incredibly simple
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.480]   by Nobel laureate William Sharpe,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.080]   Arithmetic of Active Management.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.680]   And what it says is that if the stock market--
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.800]   let's just define it as the US stock market--
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.480]   earns 10%, the average dollar invested
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.440]   is going to earn 10% less the fees.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.320]   And by the way, that's over any period of time--
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.920]   year to date, 20 years, et cetera.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.240]   And Rick is right.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.880]   Over the long period of time, the total stock funds
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.280]   do better and better and better.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.120]   So the doctor analogy-- the first time
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.720]   I met Gus Sauter, who was the chief investment
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.840]   officer of Vanguard and launched the Vanguard Total Stock Index
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.000]   Fund, he gave me this analogy.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.080]   If you needed heart surgery, would you
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.680]   find the cheapest heart surgeon or the best?
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.360]   What's wrong with this analogy?
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.320]   And by the way, he gave me this analogy
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.600]   as what other active managers were using.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:41.200]   My doctor wouldn't have to make somebody else die in order
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.360]   to make me live.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.520]   The stock market is a zero-sum game.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   We do not live in Lake Wobegon.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.160]   This is where 90% of us are above average.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.240]   So how much do you want to give up
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.360]   between fees, the expense ratio, hidden fees, bid-ask, market
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.960]   impact, hedging, et cetera?
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.880]   Advisor fees, my hourly rate is a drag on returns.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.640]   Emotions, taxes-- and remember, taxes
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.040]   are charged on a nominal basis, not inflation-based.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.520]   So I showed you this slide earlier.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.960]   And again, it's incredibly important,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.880]   the cost of emotions.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.840]   Those are very, very large--
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.920]   1.7%.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.560]   So if you think about it, if a 50/50 portfolio
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.520]   might earn 3% above inflation, if we pay 1% in fees
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.240]   to the fund managers, our financial planner, investment
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.920]   advisor, et cetera, we give up another 1.7% in emotions.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.800]   And the government taxes us.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.440]   That tax number is much lower because the active fund
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.520]   is going to have lower returns and be
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.240]   a little bit more tax-efficient from that standpoint, which
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.000]   is not a good thing.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.380]   So maybe the average investor loses 0.7% of spending power.
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.640]   This is illustrative.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.880]   So the Vanguard Total Stock Index Fund--
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.120]   Christine showed this slide.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.880]   Boy, I'm really glad that we both came out
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.840]   with 4,052 holdings.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.280]   An expense ratio of 0.03% plus Vanguard
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.320]   returns all the profits from securities lending.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.960]   So the net cost is even less than that.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.000]   The total capital gain distributions
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.680]   over the last 10 years is zero.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.660]   And by the way, a lot of active fund holders
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.340]   are going to get 1099s this year when their value has gone down
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.780]   because they've sold stocks within the portfolio.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.780]   So mathematically, the average dollar
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.460]   invested in US stocks over any period of time
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.780]   must be higher for Vanguard Total Stock
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.380]   than active funds, right?
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.440]   This next slide from a research company--
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.440]   I shouldn't have used their name--
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.760]   it was very, very stressful to me
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.520]   because what it shows is that the Vanguard Total Stock Index
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.880]   Fund underperformed its peers by 1.7%,
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.680]   and 73% year-to-date of mutual funds
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.920]   bested the Total Stock Index Fund.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.900]   I can't tell you how stressful that was for me
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.460]   and how much research I spent to get to the bottom of it.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.860]   And how I got to the bottom of it
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.140]   is what Rick showed is that the S&P 500 Index Fund year-to-date
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.780]   beat most of its peers.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.380]   And then there's another fund out there
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.460]   called the Extended Market Index Fund, which
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.740]   are every company based in the United States that's
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.980]   not in the S&P 500, and both of those beat their peers.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.400]   So how could the sum of the two beat their peers?
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.560]   And John Reckenthaler helped me get to the bottom of this.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.240]   Morningstar has changed the way it looks at the total market.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.560]   It used to be a third growth, a third value, and a third core.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   Now growth is much larger.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.080]   So I argue the market is the market.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.480]   It's neither growth nor value.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.600]   If you own everything, you own everything.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.840]   So John Reckenthaler is just absolutely brilliant.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.360]   And you really know somebody who's
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.920]   good when you disagree with them,
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   and they get to the bottom of things.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.560]   So as he puts it, owning a low-cost, market-cap-weighted
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.200]   index fund is both psychologically
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.760]   and mathematically superior.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.040]   So we hate to lose money.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.280]   I've lost money this year.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.440]   But I know that I've lost less money in the US market
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.320]   than most other people.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.000]   So the most important sentence I've ever written on investing
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.480]   is minimize expenses and emotions,
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.240]   maximize diversification and discipline.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.080]   It's that simple.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.760]   So conclusion, you can have a bad low-cost portfolio,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.480]   but you can't have a good high-cost portfolio.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.560]   I could have had everything in a low-cost Russian index fund,
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.440]   and that wouldn't have worked out all that well.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.240]   Not very diversified.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.800]   So John Bogle gave us access to low-cost and high
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.160]   diversification.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.000]   It's up to us to manage discipline and emotions.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.360]   Smart beta was the rage about 10 years ago.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.160]   Let's put everything in value, equal-weighted, small-cap,
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.400]   momentum.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.040]   And that's active investing.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.040]   I embrace dumb beta, which Christine was nice enough
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.160]   to interview me on The Long View and appropriately titled
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.280]   Why I Embrace Dumb Beta.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.040]   So understand what Jack Bogle meant
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.400]   by the tyranny of compounding, of costs
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.120]   on our financial freedom.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.680]   Costs must be low, diversification high.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.740]   you
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:24.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
