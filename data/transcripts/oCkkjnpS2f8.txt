[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   The following is a conversation with Stephen Kotkin,
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.440]   a professor of history at Princeton University
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.840]   and one of the great historians of our time,
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.040]   specializing in Russian and Soviet history.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.240]   He has written many books on Stalin in the Soviet Union,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.640]   including the first two of a three-volume work on Stalin,
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.980]   and he's currently working on volume three.
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.560]   You may have noticed that I've been speaking
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.440]   with not just computer scientists,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.600]   but physicists, engineers, historians, neuroscientists,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   and soon, much more.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.880]   To me, artificial intelligence is much bigger
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.560]   than deep learning, bigger than computing.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.480]   It is our civilization's journey
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.520]   into understanding the human mind
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.480]   and creating echoes of it in the machine.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.920]   To me, that journey must include a deep, historical,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.840]   and psychological understanding of power.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.760]   Technology puts some of the greatest power
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.600]   in the history of our civilization
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.580]   into the hands of engineers and computer scientists.
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.200]   This power must not be abused.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.600]   And the best way to understand
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.520]   how such abuse can be avoided
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.820]   is to not be blind to the lessons of history.
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.840]   As Stephen Kotkin brilliantly articulates,
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.480]   Stalin was arguably one of the most powerful humans
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.920]   in history.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.440]   I've read many books on Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Putin,
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.920]   and the wars of the 20th century.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.560]   I hope you understand the value of such knowledge
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.880]   to all of us, especially to engineers and scientists
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.040]   who build the tools of power in the 21st century.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.760]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.040]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.000]   give us five stars on Apple Podcast,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.600]   follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.680]   or simply connect with me on Twitter,
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.920]   @lexfriedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.060]   I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.720]   I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.320]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.520]   that can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.960]   I hope that works for you
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.200]   and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.760]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.120]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.940]   I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.640]   but you can also use it to buy, sell,
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.000]   and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.560]   Cash App also has an investing feature.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.600]   You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.840]   no matter what the stock price is.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.640]   Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.520]   a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   I'm excited to be working with Cash App
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.640]   to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.080]   best known for their FIRST Robotics and LEGO competitions.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.400]   They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.280]   in over 110 countries
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.740]   and have a perfect rating at Charity Navigator,
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.720]   which means the donated money is used
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.080]   to maximum effectiveness.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.960]   When you get Cash App from the App Store at Google Play
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   and use code LEXPODCAST,
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.920]   you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.000]   which again is an organization
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.720]   that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.440]   to dream of engineering a better world.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.760]   And now here's my conversation with Stephen Kotkin.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.140]   Do all human beings crave power?
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.080]   - No.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.000]   Human beings crave security.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.080]   They crave love.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.520]   They crave adventure.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.460]   They crave power, but not equally.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.840]   - Some human beings nevertheless do crave power.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.680]   - For sure.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   - Is that deeply in the psychology of people?
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.440]   Is it something you're born with?
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.600]   Is it something you develop?
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.000]   - Some people crave a position of leadership
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.600]   or of standing out, of being recognized.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.800]   And that could be starting out in the school years
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.320]   on the schoolyard.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   It could be within their own family,
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.980]   not just in their peer group.
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.840]   Those kind of people we often see
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.160]   craving leadership positions from a young age
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.840]   often end up in positions of power,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.560]   but they can be varied positions of power.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.760]   You can have power in an institution
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.320]   where your power is purposefully limited.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.400]   For example, there's a board or a consultative body
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.980]   or a separation of powers.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.640]   Not everyone craves power whereby they're the sole power
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.800]   or they're their unconstrained power.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.680]   That's a little bit less usual.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.260]   We may think that everybody does, but not everybody does.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.960]   Those people who do crave that kind of power,
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.600]   unconstrained, the ability to decide
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.780]   as much as life or death of other people,
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.560]   those people are not everyday people.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.480]   They're not the people you encounter
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.700]   in your daily life for the most part.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.160]   Those are extraordinary people.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.300]   Most of them don't have the opportunity to live that dream.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.200]   Very few of them, in fact, end up with the opportunity
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.360]   to live that dream.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.440]   - So percentage-wise, in your sense,
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.840]   if we think of George Washington, for example,
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.720]   would most people given the choice of absolute power
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.760]   over a country versus maybe the capped power
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.680]   that the United States presidential role,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.280]   at least at the founding of the country, represented,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.840]   what do you think most people would choose?
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.200]   - Well, Washington was in a position
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.860]   to exercise far greater power than he did.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.400]   And in fact, he didn't take that option.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   He was more interested in seeing institutionalization.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.960]   Of seeing the country develop strong institutions
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.500]   rather than an individual leader like himself
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.300]   have excess power.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.500]   So that's very important.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.760]   So like I said, not everyone craves unconstrained power
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.660]   even if they're very ambitious.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.860]   And of course, Washington was very ambitious.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.140]   He was a successful general before he was a president.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.720]   So that clearly comes from the influences on your life,
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.300]   where you grow up, how you grow up, how you raised,
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.780]   what kind of values are imparted to you along the way.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.100]   You can understand power as the ability to share
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.380]   or you can understand or the ability to advance something
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.060]   for the collective in a collective process,
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.100]   not an individual process.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.780]   So power comes in many different varieties
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.740]   and ambition doesn't always equate to despotic power.
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.280]   Despotic power is something different
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.280]   from ordinary institutional power that we see.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.440]   The president of MIT does not have unconstrained power.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.680]   The president of MIT rightly must consult
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.880]   with other members of the administration,
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.160]   with the faculty members,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.200]   to a certain extent with the student body
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.120]   and certainly with the trustees of MIT.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   Those constraints make the institution strong and enduring
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.780]   and make the decisions better than they would be
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.940]   if he had unconstrained power.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.140]   But you can't say that the president is not ambitious.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.980]   Of course, the president is ambitious.
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.580]   We worry about unconstrained power.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.720]   We worry about executive authority that's not limited.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.040]   That's the definition of authoritarianism
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   or tyranny, unlimited or barely limited executive authority.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.180]   Executive authority is necessary
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.260]   to carry out many functions.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.380]   We all understand that.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.440]   That's why MIT has an executive, has a president.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:56.620]   But unlimited or largely unconstrained executive power
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.620]   is detrimental to even the person who exercises that power.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.100]   - So what do you think, it's an interesting notion.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.660]   We kind of take it for granted
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.680]   that constraints on executive power is a good thing.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.140]   But why is that necessarily true?
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.580]   So what is it about absolute power
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.880]   that does something bad to the human mind?
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.900]   So, you know, the popular saying
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.300]   of absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.300]   Is that the case, that the power in itself
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.100]   is the thing that corrupts the mind in some kind of way
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.780]   where it leads to a bad leadership over time?
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.340]   - People make more mistakes when they're not challenged,
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.580]   when they don't have to explain things
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.140]   and get others to vote and go along with it,
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.180]   when they can make a decision
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.220]   without anybody being able to block their decision
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.460]   or to have input necessarily on their decision.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.540]   You're more prone to mistakes.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.940]   You're more prone to extremism.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.020]   There's a temptation there.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.780]   For example, we have separation of powers
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.380]   in the United States.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.140]   The Congress, right, has authority
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.380]   that the president doesn't have,
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.400]   as for example in budgeting, the so-called power of the purse.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.580]   This can be very frustrating.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.660]   People wanna see things happen
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.460]   and they complain that there's a do-nothing Congress
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.300]   or that the situation is stalemated.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.820]   But actually, that's potentially a good thing.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.100]   In fact, that's how our system was designed.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.500]   Our system was designed to prevent things happening
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.940]   in government.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.900]   And there's frustration with that,
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.100]   but ultimately that's the strength
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.340]   of the institutions we have.
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.460]   And so when you see unconstrained executive authority,
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.260]   there can be a lot of dynamism,
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.220]   a lot of things can get done quickly,
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.220]   but those things can be like, for example,
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.620]   what happened in China under Mao
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.620]   or what happened in the Soviet Union under Stalin
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.780]   or what happened in Haiti under Papa Doc and then Baby Doc
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.780]   or fill in the blank, right?
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.020]   What happens sometimes in corporations
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.780]   where a corporate leader is not constrained
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.540]   by the shareholders, by the board or by anything.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.940]   And they can seem to be a genius for a while,
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.620]   but eventually it catches up to them.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.100]   And so the idea of constraints on executive power
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.100]   is absolutely fundamental to the American system,
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:38.100]   American way of thinking, and not only America,
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.140]   obviously large other parts of the world
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.980]   that have a similar system, not an identical system,
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.500]   but a similar system of checks and balances
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.340]   on executive power.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.660]   And so the case that I study,
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.820]   the only checks and balances on executive power
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.900]   are circumstantial.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.460]   So for example, distances in the country,
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.180]   it's hard to do something over 5,000 miles
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.580]   or the amount of time in a day,
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.380]   it's hard for a leader to get to every single thing
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.620]   the leader wants to get to
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.260]   because there are only 24 hours in a day.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.700]   Those are circumstantial constraints on executive power.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.420]   They're not institutional constraints on executive power.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.060]   One of the constraints on executive power
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.420]   the United States has versus Russia
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.300]   may be something you've implied
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.620]   and actually spoke directly to
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.380]   is there's something in the Russian people
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.380]   and the Soviet people that are attracted
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.380]   to authoritarian power, psychologically speaking,
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.740]   or at least the kind of leaders
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.100]   that sought authoritarian power throughout its history.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.580]   And that desire for that kind of human
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.980]   is a lack of a constraint.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.100]   In America, it seems as people,
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.220]   we desire somebody not like Stalin,
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.020]   somebody more like George Washington.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.900]   So that's another constraint,
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.020]   the belief of the people,
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.620]   what they admire in a leader, what they seek in a leader.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.400]   So maybe you can speak to,
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.660]   well, first of all,
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.980]   can you speak briefly to that psychology of,
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.140]   is there a difference between the Russian people
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.700]   and the American people
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.900]   in terms of just what we find attractive in a leader?
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.180]   - Not as great a difference as it might seem.
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.900]   There are unfortunately many Americans
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.540]   who would be happy with an authoritarian leader
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.900]   in the country.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.380]   It's by no means a majority.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.380]   It's not even a plurality,
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.860]   but nonetheless, it's a real sentiment in the population.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.220]   Sometimes because they feel frustrated,
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.420]   because things are not getting done.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.100]   Sometimes because they're against
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.060]   something that's happening in the political realm,
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.940]   and they feel it has to be corrected and corrected quickly.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.220]   It's a kind of impulse.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.380]   People can regret the impulse later on,
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.020]   that the impulse is motivated
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.180]   by reaction to their environment.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.980]   In the Russian case, we have also people who crave,
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.940]   sometimes known as a strong hand,
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.980]   an iron hand, an authoritarian leader.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.860]   Because they want things to be done
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.860]   and be done more quickly that align with their desires.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.780]   But I'm not sure it's a majority in the country today.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.100]   Certainly in Stalin's time,
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.300]   this was a widespread sentiment.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.940]   And people had few alternatives
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.580]   that they understood or could appeal to.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.500]   Nowadays in the globalized world,
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.380]   the citizens of Russia can see how
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.900]   other systems have constraints on executive power.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.860]   And the life isn't so bad there.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.780]   In fact, the life might even be better.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.140]   So the impatience, the impulse of quality,
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.180]   the frustration does sometimes,
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.540]   and people reinforce their craving
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.060]   for the unconstrained executive
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.220]   to quote, "Get things done," or "Shake things up."
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.460]   Yes, that's true.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.100]   But in the Russian case, I'm not sure it's cultural today.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.100]   I think it might be more having to do
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.300]   with the failures, the functional failures
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.260]   of the kind of political system
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.900]   that they tried to institute after the Soviet collapse.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.260]   And so it may be frustration with the version
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.300]   of constraints on executive power they got
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.820]   and how it didn't work the way it was imagined,
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.500]   which has led to a sense in which
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.660]   non-constrained executive power could fix things.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.060]   But I'm not sure that that's a majority sentiment
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.540]   in the Russian case, although it's hard to measure
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.980]   because under authoritarian regimes,
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.980]   a public opinion is shaped by the environments
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.780]   in which people live, which is very constrained
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.700]   in terms of public opinion.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.900]   - But on that point, why, at least from a distance,
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.860]   does there seem to nevertheless be support
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.740]   for the current Russian president, Vladimir Putin?
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.180]   Is that have to do with the fact that measuring,
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.100]   getting good metrics and statistics on support
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.540]   is difficult in authoritarian governments,
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.180]   or is there still something appealing
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.660]   to that kind of power to the people?
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.660]   - I think we have to give credit to President Putin
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.860]   for understanding the psychology of the Russians
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.620]   to whom he appeals.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.420]   Many of them were the losers
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.260]   in the transition from communism.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.340]   They were the ones whose pensions were destroyed by inflation
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.420]   or whose salaries didn't go up
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.340]   or whose regions were abandoned.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.180]   They were not the winners for the most part.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.540]   And so I think there's an understanding
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.660]   on his part of their psychology.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.340]   Putin has grown in the position.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.940]   He was not a public politician when he first started out.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.700]   He was quite poor in public settings.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.300]   He didn't have the kind of political instincts
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.740]   that he has now.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.540]   He didn't have the appeal to traditional values
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.940]   and the Orthodox Church
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.940]   and some of the other dimensions of his rule today.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.580]   So yes, we have to give some credit to Putin himself
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.940]   for this, in addition to the frustrations
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.100]   and the mass of the people.
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.020]   But let's think about it this way in addition,
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.580]   without taking away the fact
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.780]   that he's become a better retail politician over time.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.860]   And that sentiment has shifted because of the disappointments
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.100]   with the transition with the population.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:55.420]   When I ask my kids, am I a good dad?
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:01.140]   My kids don't have any other dad to measure me against.
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.140]   I'm the only dad they know
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.380]   and I'm the only dad they can choose or not choose.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.380]   If they don't choose me, they still get me as dad, right?
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.420]   So with Putin today, he's the only dad
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.300]   that the Russian people have.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.980]   Now, if my kids were introduced to alternative fathers,
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.580]   they might be better than me.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:29.580]   They might be more loving, more giving, funnier, richer,
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.220]   whatever it might be, they might be more appealing.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.740]   There are some blood ties there for sure
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.460]   that I have with my kids,
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.100]   but they would at least be able to choose alternatives
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.700]   and then I would have to win their favor
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.740]   in that constellation of alternatives.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.140]   If President Putin were up against real alternatives,
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.100]   if the population had real choice
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.700]   and that choice could express itself and have resources
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.100]   and have media and everything else the way he does,
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.860]   maybe he would be very popular
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.540]   and maybe his popularity would not be as great
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.460]   as it currently is.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.600]   So the absence of alternatives is another factor
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.900]   that reinforces his authority and his popularity.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.220]   Having said that, there are many authoritarian leaders
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.660]   who deny any alternatives to the population
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.180]   and are not very popular.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.900]   So denial of alternatives
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.700]   doesn't guarantee you the popularity.
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.420]   You still have to figure out the mass psychology
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.100]   and be able to appeal to it.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:44.060]   So in the Russian case, the winners from the transition
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.060]   live primarily in the big cities
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:54.000]   and are self-employed or entrepreneurial.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.220]   Even if they're not self-employed,
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.900]   they're able to change careers.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.580]   They have tremendous skills and talent
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.660]   and education and knowledge,
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.000]   as well as these entrepreneurial or dynamic personalities.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.860]   Putin also appealed to them.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.700]   He did that with Medvedev, and it was a very clever ruse.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.700]   He himself appealed to the losers from the transition,
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.220]   the small towns, the rural,
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.220]   the people who were not well off,
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.620]   and he had them for the most part.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.620]   Not all, we don't wanna generalize
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.100]   to say that he had every one of them
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.100]   because those people have views of their own,
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.260]   sometimes in contradiction with the president of Russia.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.680]   And then he appealed to the opposite people,
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.940]   the successful urban base,
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.020]   through the so-called reformer Medvedev,
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.900]   the new generation, the technically literate
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.900]   prime minister who for a time was president.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.220]   And so that worked very successfully for Putin.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.700]   He was able to bridge a big divide in the society
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.060]   and gain a greater mass support
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.140]   than he would otherwise have had by himself.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.940]   That ruse only worked through the time
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:18.820]   that Medvedev was temporarily president for a few years
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.400]   because of the constitution,
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.300]   Putin couldn't do three consecutive terms
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.300]   and stepped aside in what they call castling in chess.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.060]   When this was over, Putin had difficulty
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.260]   with his popularity.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.480]   There were mass protests in the urban areas,
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.560]   precisely that group of the population
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.920]   that he had been able to win in part
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.540]   because of the Medvedev castling
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:51.580]   and now had had their delusions exposed
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.000]   and were disillusioned.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.500]   And there were these mass protests in the urban areas,
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.940]   not just in the capital, by the way.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.940]   And Putin had to, as it were,
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.300]   come up with a new way to fix his popularity,
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.460]   which happened to be the annexation of Crimea,
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.460]   from which he got a very significant bump.
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:15.460]   However, the trend is back in the other direction.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.820]   It's diminishing again, although it's still high
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.880]   relative to other leaders around the world.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.860]   So I wouldn't say that he's unpopular
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.220]   with the mass in Russia.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.480]   There is some popularity there, there is some success.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.060]   But I would say it's tough for us to gauge
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.500]   because of the lack of alternatives.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.640]   And Putin is unpopular inside the state administration.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.780]   - At every level, the bureaucracy of the leadership?
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.660]   - Because those people are well-informed
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.180]   and they understand that the country is declining,
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.180]   that the human capital is declining,
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.380]   the infrastructure is declining,
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.140]   the economy is not really growing,
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.200]   it's not really diversifying,
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.060]   Russia's not investing in its future.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.340]   The state officials understand all of that,
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.820]   and then they see that the Putin clique
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.180]   is stealing everything in sight.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.100]   So between the failure to invest in a future
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.180]   and the corruption of a narrow group around the president,
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.180]   there's disillusionment in the state apparatus
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.700]   'cause they see this more clearly or more closely
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.560]   than the mass of the population.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:32.420]   They can't necessarily yet oppose this in public
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:38.040]   because they're people, they have families,
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.660]   they have careers, they have children
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.940]   who wanna go to school or want a job.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.360]   And so there are constraints on their ability
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   to oppose the regime based upon what we might call cowardice
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.660]   or other people might call realism.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.820]   I don't know how courageous people can be
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:00.660]   when their family, children, career are on the line.
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.180]   So it's very interesting dynamic to see
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.340]   the disillusionment inside the government
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.500]   with the president, which is not yet fully public
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.980]   for the most part, but could become public.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.860]   And once again, if there's an alternative,
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.500]   if an alternative appears, things could shift quickly.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.080]   And that alternative could come from inside the regime.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.460]   - From inside the regime, but the leadership,
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.880]   the party, the people that are now,
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.380]   as you're saying, opposed to Putin,
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:34.200]   nevertheless, maybe you can correct me,
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   but it feels like there's structurally is deeply corrupt.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.960]   So each of the people we're talking about
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.180]   are don't feel like a George Washington.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.080]   - Once again, the circumstances don't permit them
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.080]   to act that way necessarily.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.800]   George Washington did great things,
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.500]   but in certain circumstances.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.360]   A lot of the state officials in Russia
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.540]   for certain are corrupt, there's no question.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.320]   Many of them, however, are patriotic.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:11.560]   And many of them feel badly
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.260]   about where the country has been going.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.120]   They would prefer that the country was less corrupt.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.060]   They would prefer that there were greater investment
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:24.180]   in all sorts of areas of Russia.
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.780]   They might even themselves steal less
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.880]   if they could be guaranteed
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.980]   that everybody else would steal less.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.980]   There's a deep and abiding patriotism inside Russia,
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.380]   as well as inside the Russian regime.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.280]   So they understand that Putin in many ways
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.840]   rescued the Russian state from the chaos of the 1990s.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.680]   They understand that Russia was in very bad shape
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.680]   as an incoherent failing state almost when Putin took over.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.840]   And that he did some important things
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.400]   for Russia's stability and consolidation.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.840]   There's also some appreciation
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.960]   that Putin stood up to the West
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.560]   and stood up to more powerful countries
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.760]   and regained a sense of pride and maneuverability
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.300]   for Russia and the international system.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.680]   People appreciate that and it's real.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   It's not imagined that Putin accomplished that.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.840]   The problem is the methods that he accomplished it with.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.200]   He used the kind of methods, that is to say,
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.280]   taking other people's property,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.480]   putting other people in jail for political reasons.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.320]   He used the kind of methods that are not conducive
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.040]   to long-term growth and stability.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.840]   So he fixed the problem, but he fixed the problem
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.800]   and then created even bigger
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.360]   long-term problems potentially.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.640]   And moreover, all authoritarian regimes
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.640]   that use those methods are tempted to keep using them
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.400]   and using them and using them
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.640]   until they're the only ones who are the beneficiaries.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.320]   And the group narrows and narrows.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.440]   The elite gets smaller and narrower.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.640]   The interest groups get excluded from power
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.360]   and their ability to continue
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.480]   enjoying the fruits of the system.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.520]   And the resentment grows.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.640]   And so that's the situation we have in Russia.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.920]   Russia is a place that is stuck.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.400]   It was to a certain extent rescued.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.080]   It was rescued with methods that were not conducive
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.880]   to long-term success and stability.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.080]   - The rescue you're referring to
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.720]   is the sort of the economic growth
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.560]   when Putin first took off the system?
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.600]   - Yes, they had 10 years.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.120]   They had a full decade of an average of 7% growth a year,
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.440]   which was phenomenal and is not attributable
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.020]   predominantly to oil prices.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.180]   During President Putin's first term as president,
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.960]   the average price of oil was $35 a barrel.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.300]   During his second term as president,
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.500]   the average price was $70 a barrel.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.040]   So during those two terms,
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.680]   when Russia was growing at about 7% a year,
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.680]   oil prices were averaging somewhere around $50 a barrel,
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.400]   which is fine, but is not the reason
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:28.400]   because later on, when oil prices were over $100 a barrel,
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.840]   Russia stagnated.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.840]   - So the initial growth,
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.240]   do you think Putin deserves some credit for that?
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.760]   - Yes, he does, because he introduced
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.160]   some important liberalizing measures.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.080]   He lowered taxes.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.620]   He allowed land to be bought and sold.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:50.160]   He deregulated many areas of the economy.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.000]   And so there was a kind of entrepreneurial burst
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.200]   that was partly attributable,
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.780]   partly attributable to government policy
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.800]   during his first term.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.980]   But also he was consolidating political power.
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:08.200]   And as I said, the methods he used overall
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.840]   for the long term were not able
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   to continue, sustain that success.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.360]   In addition, we have to remember
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.280]   that China played a really big role
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.360]   in the success of Russia
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.240]   in the first two terms of Putin's presidency,
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.480]   because China's phenomenal growth
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.240]   created insatiable demand for just about everything
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.160]   that the Soviet Union used to produce.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.560]   So fertilizers, cement, fill in the blank,
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   chemicals, metals, China had insatiable demand
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.120]   for everything the Soviet Union once produced.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   And so China's raising of global demand overall
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.940]   brought Soviet era industry back from the dead.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.360]   And so there was something that happened.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.920]   Soviet era industry fell off a cliff in the 1990s.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.360]   There was a decline in manufacturing
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.120]   and industrial production greater
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.860]   than in the Great Depression in the US.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:20.120]   But a lot of that came back online in the 2000s.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.960]   And that had to do with China's phenomenal growth.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.280]   The trade between China and Russia was not always direct.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.560]   So this was an indirect effect,
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.980]   but raising global prices for the commodities
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.880]   and the products, the kind of lower end,
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.000]   lower value products in manufacturing,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.260]   not high end stuff, but lower end stuff,
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:49.260]   like steel or iron or cement or fertilizer,
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.660]   where the value added is not spectacular,
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.760]   but nonetheless, which had been destroyed by the 1990s
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.640]   after the Soviet collapse, this was brought back to life.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.540]   Now you can do that once.
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.600]   You can bring Soviet era industry back to life once.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.240]   And that happened during Putin's first two terms,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.500]   in addition to the liberalizing policies,
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.280]   which spurred entrepreneurialism
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.000]   in some small and medium business.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.560]   The crash of the ruble in 1998,
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.900]   which made Russian products much cheaper abroad
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.020]   and made imports much more expensive,
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.040]   also facilitated the resuscitation,
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.500]   the revival of domestic manufacturing.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.500]   So all of this came together for that spectacular 10 year,
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:43.020]   7% on average economic growth,
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.660]   and moreover, people's wages after inflation,
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.580]   their disposable income grew more even than GDP grew.
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:57.400]   So disposable income after inflation, that is real income,
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.800]   was growing greater than 7%, in some cases 10% a year.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.920]   So there was a boom and the Russian people felt it,
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.440]   and it happened during Putin's first two terms,
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.540]   and people were grateful, rightly so, for that.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.880]   And those who don't wanna give Putin credit
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.140]   give oil prices all the credit.
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:23.520]   But I don't think that oil prices can explain this.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.600]   Having said that, that doesn't mean
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.240]   that this was sustainable over the long term.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.460]   - Right.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.500]   So you've briefly mentioned,
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.920]   sort of implying the possibility,
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.620]   Stalin held power for, let's say, 30 years.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.960]   You briefly mentioned that, as a question,
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.100]   will Putin be able to beat that record,
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.440]   to beat that?
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.000]   So can you talk about your sense of,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.840]   is it possible that Putin holds power
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.060]   for that kind of duration?
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:54.920]   - Let's hope not.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.660]   Let's hope not for Russia's sake.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:04.160]   The primary victims of President Putin's power are Russians.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.640]   They're not Ukrainians, although to a certain extent,
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.800]   Ukraine has suffered because of Putin's actions.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.400]   And they're not Americans.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.000]   They're Russians.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.240]   Moreover, Russia has lost a great deal of human talent.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.840]   Millions and millions of people have left Russia
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.120]   since 1991 overall.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.560]   Somewhere between five and 10 million people
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.800]   have left the country,
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.560]   and are beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.680]   So they left the Soviet space entirely.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.800]   Moreover, the people who left are not the poor people.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.240]   They're not the uneducated.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.760]   They're not the losers.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.680]   The people who've left are the more dynamic parts
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.080]   of the population.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.000]   The better educated, the more entrepreneurial.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.700]   So that human capital loss that Russia has suffered
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.340]   is phenomenal.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.600]   And in fact, right here where we're sitting at MIT,
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.360]   we have examples of people who are qualified,
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.600]   good enough for MIT,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.240]   and have left Russia to come to MIT.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.840]   - You're looking at one of them.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.640]   And the other aspect, just to quickly comment,
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.000]   is those same people, like me,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.720]   I'm not welcome back.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.360]   - No, you're not under the current regime.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:26.600]   It was a big loss for Russia if you're patriotic,
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.760]   but not from the point of view of the Putin regime.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.560]   That has to do also factors into popularity.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.740]   If the people who don't like you leave,
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.360]   they're not there to complain, to protest,
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.040]   to vote against you.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:46.040]   And so your opposition declines when you let them leave.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.100]   However, it's very costly in human capital terms.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.360]   Hemorrhaging that much human capital is damaging.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.920]   It's self-damaging.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.960]   And we've seen it accelerate.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.240]   It was already high, but we've seen it accelerate
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.080]   in the last, oh, seven to eight years
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.960]   of President Putin's rule.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.840]   And those people are not going back of their own volition,
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.480]   but even if they wanted to go back,
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.720]   as you just said, they'd be unwelcome.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.080]   That's a big cost to pay for this regime.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.560]   And so whatever benefits this regime might
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.960]   or might not have given to the country,
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.760]   the disadvantages, the downside,
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.200]   the costs are also really high.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.540]   So we don't want Putin lasting in power as long as Stalin.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.240]   It would be better if Russia were able to choose
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.680]   among options, to choose a new leader among options.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.120]   Many people speculate that President Putin
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.880]   will name a successor the way Yeltsin named Putin
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.440]   as his successor, President Boris Yeltsin.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.560]   And then Putin will leave the stage
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.400]   and allow the successor to take over.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.280]   That might seem like a good solution,
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.400]   but once again, we don't need a system
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.000]   where you hang on for as long as possible
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.600]   then nominate who's gonna take over.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.880]   We need a system that has the kind of corrective mechanisms
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:19.640]   that democracies and markets have along with rule of law.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.640]   A corrective mechanism is really important
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.400]   because all leaders make mistakes.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.380]   But when you can't correct for the mistakes,
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.580]   then the mistakes get compounded.
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.780]   Putin could well, he seems to be healthy.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.220]   He could well last as many years as Stalin.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:43.100]   It's hard to predict because events intercede sometimes
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.380]   and create circumstances that are unforeseen
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.580]   and leaders get overthrown or have a heart attack
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.420]   or whatever.
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.460]   There's a palace insurrection where ambitious leaders
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:36:00.460]   on the inside for both personal power and patriotic reasons
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.940]   try to push aside an aging leader.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.700]   There are many scenarios in which Putin
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.260]   could not last that long, but unfortunately right now,
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.580]   you could also imagine potentially him lasting that long,
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.820]   which as I said, is not an outcome if you're patriotic
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.780]   about Russia, is not an outcome
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.700]   you would wish out to the country.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.540]   - I guess a very difficult question,
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:29.540]   but what practically do you feel is a way out
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:34.640]   of the Putin regime, is the way out of the corruption
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.000]   that's deeply underlies the state?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.040]   If you look from a history perspective,
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.160]   is a revolution required?
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.920]   Is violence required?
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:53.960]   From a violence within or external to the country?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.160]   Do you see, or is a powerful,
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.560]   is a inspiring leader enough to step in
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:08.420]   and bring democracy and kind of the free world to Russia?
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.040]   - So Russia is not a failed country.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.660]   It's a middle income country with a tremendous potential
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.780]   and has proven many times in the past
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.920]   that when it gets in a bad way,
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.900]   it can reverse its trajectory.
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.820]   Moreover, violence is rarely ever a solution.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:33.180]   Violence rarely, it may break an existing trend,
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.420]   but it's rare that violence produces
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.720]   a non-violent sustainable positive outcome.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.060]   It happens, but it doesn't happen frequently.
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:47.060]   Societal upheaval is not a way always
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:51.620]   to institutionalize a better path forward
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.240]   because you need institutions.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.080]   People can protest as they did throughout the Middle East
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.580]   and the protests didn't necessarily lead to better systems
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:06.420]   because the step from protest to new, strong,
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.740]   consolidated institutions is a colossal leap,
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.740]   not a small step.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.060]   What we need and what we see from history
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.820]   in situations like this is a group
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.360]   within the power structures, which is a patriotic,
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.020]   that sees things going down,
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:29.420]   that is to say that sees things not being developing
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.560]   relative to neighbors, relative to richer countries,
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.580]   relative to more successful countries,
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.180]   and they want to change the trajectory of Russia.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.800]   And if they can, in a coalition fashion,
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.820]   unseat the current regime
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.060]   for a new power sharing arrangement,
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.960]   which once again can be frustrating
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.160]   because you can't do changes immediately,
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.700]   you can't do things overnight, but that's the point.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.420]   Constraints on your ability
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.080]   to change everything immediately
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.060]   and to force change overnight
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.720]   is what leads to long-term success, potentially.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.060]   That's the sustainability of change.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.880]   So Russia needs stronger institutions.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.880]   It needs court system as well as democratic institutions.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.000]   It needs functioning, open, dynamic markets
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.220]   rather than monopolies.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.820]   It needs meritocracy and banks to award loans
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.140]   on the basis of business plans,
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.700]   not on the basis of political criteria
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.860]   or corrupt bribery or whatever it might be.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:44.180]   So Russia needs those kind of functioning institutions
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:48.420]   that take time, are sometimes slow,
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.220]   don't lead to a revolutionary transformation,
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.060]   but lead to potentially long-term sustainable growth
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.180]   without upheaval, without violence,
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.020]   without getting into a situation
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:04.460]   where all of a sudden you need a miracle again.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.740]   Every time Russia seems to need a miracle,
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.640]   and that's the problem.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.300]   The solution would be not needing a miracle.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.900]   Now, having said that, the potential is there.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.020]   The civilization that we call Russia
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.280]   is amazingly impressive.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.240]   It has delivered world-class culture,
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.960]   world-class science.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.960]   It's a great power.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.080]   It's not a great power with a strong base right now,
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.460]   but nonetheless, it is a great power as it acts in the world.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.380]   So I wouldn't underestimate Russia's abilities here,
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.740]   and I wouldn't write off Russia.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.060]   I don't see it under the current regime,
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.340]   a renewal of the country.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.940]   But if we can have, from within the regime,
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.760]   an evolution rather than a revolution
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.580]   in a positive direction,
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.980]   and maybe get a George Washington figure
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:03.240]   who is strong enough to push through institutionalization
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.140]   rather than personalism.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:09.360]   - So if I could ask about one particular individual,
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.020]   it'd be just interesting to get your comment,
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.740]   but also as a representative of potential leaders.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:18.580]   I just on this podcast talked to Garry Kasparov,
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:23.220]   who I'm not sure if you're familiar with his ongoings.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.420]   So besides being a world-class chess player,
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.500]   he's also a very outspoken activist,
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.340]   sort of seeing Putin,
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.740]   truly seeing Putin as an enemy of the free world,
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.740]   of democracy, of balanced government in Russia.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:43.700]   What do you think of people like him specifically,
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.500]   or just people like him trying as leaders
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.460]   to step in to run for president,
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.320]   to symbolize a new chapter in Russia's future?
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.860]   - So we don't need individuals.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.740]   Some individuals are very impressive,
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.300]   and they have courage, and they protest,
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.980]   and they criticize, and they organize.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.820]   We need institutions.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.340]   We need a Duma, or a parliament that functions.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:15.220]   We need a court system that functions,
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.100]   that is to say where there are a separation of powers,
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.260]   impartial professional civil service,
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:27.940]   impartial professional judiciary.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.300]   Those are the things Russia needs.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.860]   It's rare that you get that from an individual
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.220]   no matter how impressive, right?
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.700]   We had Andrei Sakharov,
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.740]   who was an extraordinary individual,
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:45.620]   who developed the hydrogen bomb under Soviet regime,
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.140]   was a world-class physicist,
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:53.780]   was then upset about how his scientific knowledge
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.340]   and scientific achievements were being put to use,
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:02.340]   and rebelled to try to put limits, constraints,
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.580]   civilizing, humane limits and constraints
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:10.580]   on some of the implications of his extraordinary science.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.780]   But Sakharov, even if he had become the leader
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.500]   of the country, which he did not become,
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.140]   he was more of a moral or spiritual leader,
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.620]   it still wouldn't have given you a judiciary.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.140]   It still wouldn't have given you a civil service.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.020]   It still wouldn't have given you a Duma,
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.060]   or functioning parliament.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.180]   You need a leader in coalition with other leaders.
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.580]   You need a bunch of leaders.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.900]   A whole group, and they have to be divided a little bit
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:42.500]   so that not one of them can destroy all the others.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:46.340]   And they have to be interested in creating institutions,
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:50.180]   not just, or not solely or predominantly
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.180]   in their personal power.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:56.580]   And so I have no objection to outstanding individuals
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.620]   and to the work that they do.
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.380]   But I think in institutional terms,
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.420]   and they need to think that way too
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.380]   in order to be successful.
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.700]   - So if we go back to the echoes of that
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.860]   after the Russian Revolution with Stalin,
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.300]   with Lenin and Stalin, maybe you can correct me,
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.420]   but there was a group of people there
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:19.700]   in that same kind of way,
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.820]   looking to establish institutions
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.460]   that were built in a,
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:30.860]   beautifully built around an ideology
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.420]   that they believed is good for the world.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.620]   So sort of echoing that idea
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.140]   of what we're talking about what Russia needs now,
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.260]   can you, first of all,
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.420]   you've described a fascinating thought,
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.900]   which is Stalin is having amassed
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.860]   arguably more power than any man in history.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.900]   Which is an interesting thing to think about.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.980]   But can you tell about his journey
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:00.500]   to getting that power after the Russian Revolution?
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:05.020]   How does that perhaps echo to our current discussion
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.420]   about institutions and so on?
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.460]   And just in general,
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.100]   the story I think is fascinating
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.340]   of how one man is able to get more power
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.060]   than any other man in history.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:20.020]   - It is a great story.
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.300]   Not necessarily from a moral point of view,
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.980]   but if you're interested in power,
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.900]   for sure it's an incredible story.
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.340]   We have to remember that Stalin
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.420]   is also a product of circumstances,
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.860]   not solely his own individual drive,
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.100]   which is very strong.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:43.420]   For example, World War I breaks the Tsarist regime,
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.260]   the Tsarist order, Imperial Russian State.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:51.500]   Stalin has no participation whatsoever in World War I.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.900]   He spends World War I in exile in Siberia.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.860]   Until the downfall of the Tsarist autocracy
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.300]   in February 1917,
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:07.300]   Stalin is in Eastern Siberian exile.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.860]   He's only able to leave Eastern Siberia
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.420]   when that regime falls.
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.980]   He never fights in the war.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.740]   He's called up briefly towards the end of the war
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.540]   and is disqualified on physical grounds
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.660]   because of physical deformities from being drafted.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.700]   The war continues after the Tsarist regime
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.660]   has been toppled in the capital
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.180]   and there's been a revolution.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:39.580]   The war continues and that war is very radicalizing.
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:44.420]   The peasants begin to seize the land after the Tsar falls,
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:48.740]   essentially destroying much of the gentry class.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.500]   Stalin has nothing to do with that.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.140]   The peasants have their own revolution,
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.100]   seizing the land, not in law, but in fact,
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:00.060]   de facto, not de jure land ownership.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.540]   So there are these really large processes underway
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:09.660]   that Stalin is alive during, but not a driver of.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.860]   The most improbable thing happens,
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.380]   which is a very small group of people
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:18.740]   around the figure of Vladimir Lenin
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:22.700]   announces that it has seized power.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.900]   Now by this time in October 1917,
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:30.220]   the government that has replaced the Tsar,
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.020]   the so-called provisional government, has failed.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:36.940]   And so there's not so much power to seize
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.100]   from the provisional government.
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.220]   What Lenin does is he does a coup on the left.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:48.060]   That is to say, Soviets or councils,
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.020]   as we would call them in English,
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.980]   which represent people's power
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.540]   or the masses participating in politics,
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.500]   a kind of radical grassroots democracy,
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.740]   are extremely popular all over the country
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.860]   and not dominated by any one group,
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:08.020]   but predominantly socialist or predominantly leftist.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.380]   Russia has an election during the war,
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.820]   a free and fair election for the most part,
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:20.740]   despite the war, at the end of 1917, in December 1917,
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:25.540]   and three quarters plus of the country votes socialist
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.820]   in some form or another.
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.740]   So the battle was over the definition of socialism
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:35.180]   and who had the right to participate in defining socialism,
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:39.300]   not only what it would be, but who had the right to decide.
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:43.540]   So there's a coup by Lenin's group known as the Bolsheviks
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.100]   against all the other socialists.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:50.340]   And so Lenin declares a seizure of power
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.820]   whereby the old government has failed,
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:57.140]   people's power, the councils known as the Soviets
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.580]   are gonna take their place,
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.420]   and Lenin seizes power in the name of the Soviets.
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.900]   So it's a coup against the left,
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.940]   against the rest of the left,
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.900]   not against the provisional government
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.060]   that has replaced the Tsar, which has already failed.
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.900]   And so Stalin is able to come to power along with Lenin
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:22.580]   in this crazy seizure of power on the left
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.940]   against the rest of the left in October 1917,
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.740]   which we know as the October Revolution,
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:33.580]   and I call the October coup as many other historians call.
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:38.540]   The October Revolution happened after the seizure of power.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.940]   What's interesting about this episode
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.780]   is that the leftists who seize power
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.580]   in the name of the Soviets, in the name of the masses,
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:51.300]   in the name of people's power, they retain their hold.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.580]   Many times in history,
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:56.340]   there's a seizure of power by the left, and they fail.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.980]   They collapse, they're cleaned out by an army
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.420]   or what we call forces of order,
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:04.700]   by counter-revolutionary forces.
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:08.900]   Lenin's revolution, Lenin's coup is successful.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:12.580]   It is able to hold power, not just seize power.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.140]   They win a civil war,
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:19.060]   and they're entrenched in the heart of the country
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.300]   already by 1921.
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.580]   Stalin is part of that group.
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.580]   Lenin needs somebody to run this new regime
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.220]   in the kind of nitty gritty way.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.900]   Lenin is the leader,
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:34.240]   the undisputed leader in the Bolshevik Party,
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:38.060]   which changes their name to Communists in 1918.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:42.820]   He makes Stalin the general secretary
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.380]   of the Communist Party.
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:49.860]   He creates a new position, which hadn't existed before,
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:54.740]   a kind of day-to-day political manager, a right-hand man.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.540]   Not because Lenin is looking to replace himself,
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.300]   he's looking to institutionalize a helpmate,
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.360]   a right-hand man.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.660]   He does this in the spring of 1922.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.460]   Stalin is named to this position,
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:12.460]   which Lenin has created expressly for Stalin.
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:14.860]   So there's been a coup on the left,
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:18.980]   whereby the Bolsheviks, who become Communists,
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.900]   have seized power against the rest of the Socialists
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.220]   and Anarchists and the entire left.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.660]   And then there's an institutionalization of a position
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:31.780]   known as General Secretary of the Communist Party,
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.180]   right-hand man of Lenin.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.620]   Less than six weeks after Lenin has created this position
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:41.460]   and installed Stalin, Lenin has a stroke,
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:48.060]   a major stroke, and never really returns as a full actor
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:54.060]   to power before he dies of a fourth stroke in January 1924.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.220]   So a position is created for Stalin
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.260]   to run things on Lenin's behalf,
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.940]   and then Lenin has a stroke.
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:07.420]   And so Stalin now has this new position General Secretary,
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.740]   but he's the right hand of a person
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:14.740]   who's no longer exercising day-to-day control over affairs.
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.380]   Stalin then uses this new position
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.040]   to create a personal dictatorship
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.900]   inside the Bolshevik dictatorship,
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.740]   which is the remarkable story I tried to tell.
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.180]   - So is there anything nefarious
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:31.080]   about any of what you just described?
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.260]   So it seems conveniently
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:37.080]   that the position is created just for Stalin.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.540]   There was a few other brilliant people,
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.500]   arguably more brilliant than Stalin
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.100]   in the vicinity of Lenin.
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.700]   Why was Stalin chosen?
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:50.620]   Why did Lenin all of a sudden fall ill?
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:53.700]   It's perhaps a conspiratorial question,
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.140]   but is there anything nefarious
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:59.840]   about any of this historical trajectory to power
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.740]   that Stalin took in creating the personal dictatorship?
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:05.940]   - So history is full of contingency and surprise.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:11.580]   After something happens, we all think it's inevitable.
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.740]   It had to happen that way.
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.180]   Everything was leading up to it.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:20.620]   So Hitler seizes power in Germany in 1933,
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:24.900]   and the Nazi regime gets institutionalized
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:29.180]   by several of his moves after being named chancellor.
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.940]   And so all German history becomes a story
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:35.220]   of the Nazi rise to power, Hitler's rise to power.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:40.220]   Every trend, tendency is bent into that outcome.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:43.400]   Things which don't seem related to that outcome
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.700]   all of a sudden get bent in that direction.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:50.780]   And other trends that were going on are no longer examined
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.420]   because they didn't lead to that outcome.
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:57.700]   But Hitler's becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.340]   was not inevitable, it was contingent.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.840]   He was offered the position
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.500]   by the traditional conservatives.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:05.900]   He's part of the radical right,
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:08.840]   and the traditional right named him chancellor.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.380]   The Nazi party never outright won an election
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:16.620]   that was free and fair before Hitler came to power.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.280]   And in fact, its votes on the eve
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.700]   of Hitler becoming chancellor
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.260]   declined relative to the previous election.
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.480]   So there's contingency in history,
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.220]   and so Lenin's illness, his stroke,
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:36.460]   the neurological and blood problems that he had
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:40.020]   were not a structure in history.
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.740]   In other words, if Lenin had been a healthier figure,
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:47.780]   Stalin might never have become the Stalin that we know.
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:50.820]   That's not to say that all history is accidental,
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.020]   just that we need to relate the structural,
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:57.720]   the larger structural factors to the contingent factors.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.000]   Why did Lenin pick Stalin?
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.800]   Well, Stalin was a very effective organizer,
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.280]   and the position was an organizational position.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.360]   Stalin could get things done.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.520]   He would carry out assignments no matter how difficult.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.880]   He wouldn't complain that it was hard work or too much work.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.600]   He wouldn't go off womanizing and drinking
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:22.120]   and ignore his responsibilities.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.860]   Lenin chose Stalin among other options
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:28.000]   because he thought Stalin was the better option.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.260]   Once again, he wasn't choosing his successor
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:33.800]   because he didn't know he was gonna have this stroke.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.840]   Lenin had some serious illnesses,
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.620]   but he had never had a major stroke before.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:44.100]   So the choice was made based upon
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:47.260]   Stalin's organizational skills and promise
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.960]   against the others who were in the regime.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.660]   Now, they can seem more brilliant than Stalin,
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.180]   but he was more effective,
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.780]   and I'm not sure they were very brilliant.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:01.980]   - Well, he was exceptionally competent,
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:04.420]   actually, at the tasks for running a government,
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:07.200]   the executive branch, right, of a dictator.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.680]   - Yes, he turned out to be very adept at being a dictator.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.260]   And so if he had been chosen by Lenin
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:17.740]   and had not been very good,
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.080]   he would have been pushed aside by others.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.800]   You can get a position by accident.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.860]   You can be named because you're someone's friend
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:32.240]   or someone's relative, but to hold that position,
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.460]   to hold that position in difficult circumstances,
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:38.140]   and then to build effectively a superpower
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.580]   on all that bloodshed, right,
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:44.020]   you have to be skilled in some way.
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:47.900]   It can't be just accident that brings you to power,
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:52.140]   because if accident brings you to power, it won't last.
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:54.580]   Just like we discovered with Putin,
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:57.100]   he had some qualities that we didn't foresee
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:01.260]   at the beginning, and he's been able to hold power,
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.780]   not just be named.
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.180]   Now, Putin and Stalin are very different people.
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.260]   These are very different regimes.
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.900]   I wouldn't put them in the same sentence.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.560]   My point is not that one resembles the other.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:17.920]   My point is that when people come to power
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.820]   for contingent reasons, they don't stay in power
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.900]   unless they're able to manage it.
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.580]   And Stalin was able to build a personal dictatorship
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.140]   inside that dictatorship.
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:33.660]   He was cunning, he was ruthless, and he was a workaholic.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.020]   He was very diligent.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.580]   He had a phenomenal memory,
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.640]   and so he could remember people's names
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   and faces and events, and this was very advantageous for him
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.620]   as he built the machine that became
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.060]   the Soviet state and bureaucracy.
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:52.580]   - One of the things, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:57.100]   but you've made me realize is this wasn't some kind
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:02.100]   of manipulative personality trying to gain more power solely,
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.340]   like kind of an evil picture of a person,
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:07.440]   but he truly believed in communism.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:12.020]   As far as I can understand, again,
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.140]   you can correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:15.740]   but he wanted to build a better world
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:20.740]   by having, infusing communism into the country,
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:26.020]   perhaps into the whole world.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:31.020]   So maybe my question is what role does communism
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:35.460]   as an idea, as an ideology play in all of this,
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:39.240]   in his rise to power, in the people of the time,
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.160]   in the Russian people, actually just the whole
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.260]   20th century?
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:44.440]   - You're right.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:47.960]   Stalin was a true believer, and this is very important.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:51.660]   He was also hungry for power and for personal power,
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:55.120]   but just as you said, not for power's sake,
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.840]   not only for power.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:01.720]   He was interested in enacting communism in reality,
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.520]   and also in building a powerful state.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:08.040]   He was a statist, a traditional Russian statist
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:13.040]   in the imperial sense, and this won him a lot of followers.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:16.100]   The fact that they knew he was a hardcore,
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:19.940]   true believing communist won him a lot of followers
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.980]   among the communists, and the fact that he was
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:27.180]   a hardcore defender of Russian state interests,
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:31.480]   now in the Soviet guise, also won him a lot of followers.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.120]   Sometimes those groups overlapped.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.880]   The communists and the Russian patriots,
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.480]   and sometimes they were completely different groups,
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:43.600]   but both of them shared an admiration for Stalin's
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:48.600]   dedication to those goals, and his abilities to enact them.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.600]   And so it's very important to understand
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.960]   that however thirsty he was for power,
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.100]   and he was very thirsty for power,
[00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:02.480]   that he was also driven by ideals.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.480]   Now, I don't necessarily think that everyone
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.320]   around Stalin shared those ideals.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.800]   We have to be careful not to make everybody
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   into a communist true believer,
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:20.200]   not to make everybody into a great statist Russian patriot,
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.880]   but they were widespread and powerful attractions
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.800]   for a lot of people.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.760]   And so Stalin's ability to communicate to people
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.520]   that he was dedicated to those pursuits,
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.340]   and his ability to drive towards them
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.920]   were part of his appeal.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.160]   However, he also resorted to manipulation.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.080]   He also resorted to violence.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.640]   He lied, he spoke out of all sides of his mouth,
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.640]   he slandered other people, he sabotaged potential rivals.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:00.320]   He used every underhanded method, and then some,
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.600]   in order to build his personal dictatorship.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.620]   Now, he justified this, as you said,
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:09.280]   by appeals to communism and to Soviet power.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.680]   - To himself as well, too.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.560]   - To himself and to others.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.120]   And so he justified it in his own mind and to others,
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.520]   but certainly any means, right,
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.520]   were acceptable to him to achieve these ends.
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.880]   And he identified his personal power with communism
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.360]   and with Russian glory in the world.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.040]   So he felt that he was the only one who could be trusted,
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.000]   who could be relied upon to build these things.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.720]   Now, we put ourselves back in that time period.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:47.200]   The Great Depression was a very difficult time
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.640]   for the capitalist system.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.000]   There was mass unemployment, a lot of hardship,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   fascism, Nazism, Imperial Japan.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.680]   There were a lot of associations that were negative
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.000]   with the kind of capitalist system
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   that was not 100%, not a monolith,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.400]   but had a lot of authoritarian incarnations.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.520]   There was imperialism, colonies that even
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.120]   the democratic rule of law capitalist states
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.140]   had non-democratic, non-rule of law colonies
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:25.800]   under their rule.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.600]   So the image and reality of capitalism
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.640]   during that time period between World War I
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.360]   and World War II was very different
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.320]   from how it would become later.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.960]   And so in that time period, in that interwar conjuncture
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.360]   after World War I, before World War II,
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:50.240]   communism held some appeal inside the Soviet Union for sure,
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.600]   but even outside the Soviet Union,
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.080]   because the image and reality of capitalism
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.200]   disappointed many people.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.760]   Now in the end, communism was significantly worse.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.080]   Many more victims and the system of course
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.600]   would eventually implode.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.560]   But nonetheless, there were real problems
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.120]   that communism tried to address.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.040]   It didn't solve those problems, it was not a solution,
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.160]   but it didn't come out of nowhere.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.800]   It came out of the context of that interwar period.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.120]   And so Stalin's rule, some people saw it
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.440]   as potentially a better option than imperialism,
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.440]   fascism, and Great Depression.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.760]   Having said that, they were wrong.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:37.920]   It turned out that Stalin wasn't a better alternative
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.480]   to markets and private property
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.380]   and rule of law and democracy.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:47.200]   However, that didn't become clearer to people
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.920]   until after World War II,
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.480]   after Nazism had been defeated,
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.880]   Imperial Japan had been defeated,
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.080]   a fascist Italy had been defeated,
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.360]   and decolonization had happened around the world.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.720]   And there was a middle class economic boom
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.660]   in the period from the late 40s through the 70s
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.000]   that created a kind of mass middle class in many societies.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.600]   So capitalism rose from the ashes as it were.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.800]   And this changed the game for Stalin and communism.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:26.000]   Communism is about an alternative to capitalism.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.540]   And if that alternative is not superior,
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.680]   there's no reason for communism to exist.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.520]   But if capitalism is in foul odor,
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.440]   if people have a bad opinion,
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.420]   a strong critique of capitalism,
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.400]   there can be appeal to alternatives.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.880]   And that's kind of what happened with Stalin's rule.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.100]   But after World War II, the context changed a lot.
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:54.800]   Capitalism was very different, much more successful,
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.960]   non-violent compared to what it was in the interwar period.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.120]   And the Soviet Union had a tough time competing
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.520]   against that new context.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:10.480]   Now today, we see similarly that the image and reality
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.480]   of capitalism is on the question again,
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.600]   which leads some people to find an answer
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.780]   in socialism as an alternative.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.400]   - So you just kind of painted a beautiful picture
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.240]   of comparison.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.320]   This is the way we think about ideologies
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.760]   'cause we, is what's working better.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.460]   Do you separate in your mind the ideals of communism
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:36.160]   to the Stalinist implementation of communism?
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.360]   And again, capitalism and American implementation
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.440]   of capitalism.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:45.040]   And as we look at now the 21st century where yes,
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:50.040]   this idea of socialism being a potential political system
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.760]   that we would, or economic system we would operate under
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.560]   in the United States, rising up again as an idea.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.360]   So how do we think about that again in the 21st century,
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.480]   about these ideas, fundamental deep ideas
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.880]   of communism and capitalism?
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.840]   - Yeah, so in the Marxist schema,
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.600]   there was something called feudalism,
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.920]   which was supposedly destroyed by the bourgeoisie
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.240]   who created capitalism.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.040]   And then the working class was supposed
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.840]   to destroy capitalism and create socialism.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.040]   But socialism wasn't the end stage.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.720]   The end stage was gonna be communism.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.840]   So that's why the communist party in the Soviet Union
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:37.620]   first built socialism, transcending capitalism.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.680]   The next stage was socialism and the end game,
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.720]   the final stage was communism.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:47.460]   So their version of socialism was derived from Marx.
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:52.460]   And Marx argued that the problem was capitalism
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:57.300]   had been very beneficial for a while.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:01.560]   It had produced greater wealth and greater opportunity
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:05.360]   than feudalism had, but then it had come to serve
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.680]   only the narrow interests of the so-called bourgeoisie
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.960]   or the capitalists themselves.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.760]   And so for humanity's sake, the universal class,
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.040]   the working class, needed to overthrow capitalism
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.480]   in order for greater productivity,
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.480]   greater wealth to be produced,
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.800]   for all of humanity to flourish and on a higher level.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.560]   So you couldn't have socialism
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.840]   unless you destroyed capitalism.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:37.680]   So that meant no markets, no private property,
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.840]   no so-called parliaments or bourgeois parliaments
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.240]   as they were called.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.800]   So you got socialism in Marx's schema
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.340]   by transcending, by eliminating capitalism.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:55.200]   Now, Marx also called for freedom.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.760]   He said that this elimination of markets
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.680]   and private property and bourgeois parliaments
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.080]   would produce greater freedom
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.000]   in addition to greater abundance.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.600]   However, everywhere this was tried,
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.600]   it produced tyranny and mass violence, death and shortages.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.640]   Everywhere it was tried.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.760]   There's no exception in historical terms.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.000]   And so it's very interesting.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.800]   Marx insisted that capitalism had to be eliminated.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.560]   You couldn't have markets.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.220]   Markets were chaos, you needed planning.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.680]   You couldn't have hiring of wage labor.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.800]   That was wage slavery.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.520]   You couldn't have private property
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.120]   'cause that was a form of theft.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.800]   So in the Marxist scheme,
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.760]   somehow you were gonna eliminate capitalism
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.480]   and get to freedom.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.200]   It turned out you didn't get to freedom.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.960]   So then people said, well, you can't blame Marx
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.640]   because he said we needed freedom.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.480]   He was pro-freedom.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.360]   So it's kind of like dropping a nuclear bomb.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:07.480]   You say you're gonna drop a nuclear bomb,
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.960]   but you wanna minimize civilian casualties.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.600]   So the dropping of the nuclear bomb
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.240]   is the elimination of markets,
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.200]   private property and parliaments.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.860]   But you're gonna bring freedom
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:25.680]   or you're gonna minimize civilian casualties.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.600]   So you drop the nuclear bomb,
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.720]   you eliminate the capitalism
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:34.720]   and you get famine, deportation,
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.320]   no constraints on executive power
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.720]   and not abundance, but shortages.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.360]   And people say, well, that's not what Marx said.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.800]   That's not what I said.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.780]   I said I wanted to minimize civilian casualties.
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.680]   The nuclear bomb goes off
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.120]   and there's mass civilian casualties.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.960]   And you keep saying, but I said,
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.560]   drop the bomb, but minimize civilian casualties.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.520]   So that's where we are.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.960]   That's history, not philosophy.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.940]   I'm speaking about historical examples,
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:07.100]   all the cases that we have.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:11.600]   Marx was not a theorist of inequality.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.240]   Marx was a theorist of alienation,
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:20.280]   of dehumanization, of fundamental constraints
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:25.880]   or what he called fetters on productivity and on wealth,
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.380]   which he all attributed to capitalism.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.840]   Marx wasn't bothered by inequality.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.620]   He was bothered by something deeper, something worse.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:39.680]   Those socialists who figured this out,
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.520]   who understood that if you drop the nuclear bomb,
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:48.240]   there was no way to minimize civilian casualties.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.400]   Those socialists who came to understand
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.760]   that if you eliminated capitalism,
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.920]   markets, private property and parliaments,
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.140]   if you eliminated that, you wouldn't get freedom.
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:03.340]   Those Marxists, those socialists
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.100]   became what we would call social Democrats
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:11.740]   or people who would use the state to regulate the market,
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:13.580]   not to eliminate the market.
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:18.100]   They would use the state to redistribute income,
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:21.780]   not to destroy private property and markets.
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:26.580]   And so this in the Marxist schema was apostasy
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:30.040]   because they were accepting markets and private property.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.540]   They were accepting alienation and wage slavery.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.980]   They were accepting capitalism in principle,
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.460]   but they wanted to fix it.
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.980]   They wanted to ameliorate, they wanted to regulate.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:46.260]   And so they became what was denounced as revisionists,
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:50.220]   not true Marxists, not real revolutionaries,
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:53.480]   but parliamentary road, parliamentarians.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:57.300]   We know this as normal politics,
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:01.180]   normal social democratic politics from the European case
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.540]   or from the American case,
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.420]   but they are not asking to eliminate capitalism,
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:11.740]   blaming capitalism, blaming markets and private property.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:15.080]   So this rift among the socialists,
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.020]   the ones who were for elimination of capitalism,
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:20.620]   transcending capitalism,
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:25.620]   otherwise you could never ever get to abundance
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.100]   and freedom in the Marxist schema,
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.820]   versus those who accept capitalism,
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:33.980]   but want to regulate and redistribute.
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.940]   That rift on the left has been with us
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:39.060]   almost from the beginning.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.680]   It's a kind of civil war on the left
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:45.620]   between the Leninists and the social democrats
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:48.500]   or the revisionists as they're known pejoratively
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.500]   by the Leninists.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:55.460]   We have the same confusion today in the world today,
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:13:00.460]   where people also cite Marx saying capitalism is a dead end,
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:06.240]   and we need to drop that nuclear bomb and get freedom,
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.820]   get no civilian casualties,
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:13.780]   versus those who say, yes, there are inequities,
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:16.820]   there's a lack of equality of opportunity.
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.700]   There are many other issues that we need to deal with,
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:23.460]   and we can fix those issues, we can regulate,
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:24.980]   we can redistribute.
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:28.060]   I'm not advocating this as a political position.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.980]   I'm not taking a political position myself.
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:34.020]   I'm just saying that there's a confusion on the left
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:38.100]   between those who accept capitalism and want to regulate it,
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:41.360]   versus those who think capitalism is inherently evil,
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.340]   and if we eliminate it, we'll get to a better world,
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.780]   when in fact history shows
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.300]   that if you eliminate capitalism, you get to a worse world.
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:54.380]   The problems might be real, but the solutions are worse.
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:56.340]   - From history's lessons,
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.340]   now we have deep, painful lessons,
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:00.700]   but there's not that many of them.
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:04.620]   You know, our history is relatively short as a human species.
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:09.420]   Do we have a good answer on the left of Leninists,
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.140]   Marxists versus social democrat,
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:17.140]   versus capitalism versus any anarchy?
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:21.580]   You know, do we have sufficient samples from history
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.740]   to make better decisions about the future
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.500]   of our politics and economics?
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.580]   - For sure.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:29.100]   We have the American Revolution,
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:33.780]   which was a revolution not about class, not about workers,
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:37.180]   not about a so-called universal class of the working class,
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.840]   elimination of capitalism, markets, and the bourgeoisie,
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.980]   but was about the category citizen.
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:46.860]   It was about universal humanity,
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:51.860]   where everyone in theory could be part of it as a citizen.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:55.260]   The revolution fell short of its own ideals.
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:57.160]   Not everyone was a citizen.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.060]   For example, if you didn't own property,
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.100]   you were a male but didn't own property,
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.860]   you didn't have full rights of a citizen.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:09.000]   If you were a female, whether you owned property or not,
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.140]   you weren't a full citizen.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:15.940]   If you were imported from Africa against your will,
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.900]   you were a slave and not a citizen.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:23.780]   And so not everyone was afforded the rights in actuality
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:27.280]   that were declared in principle.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.100]   However, over time, the category citizen could expand
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:35.420]   and slaves could be emancipated
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.140]   and they could get the right to vote.
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:38.700]   They could become citizens.
[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:43.040]   Non-property owning males could get the right to vote
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.520]   and become full citizens.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.480]   Females could get the right to vote
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.180]   and become full citizens.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:53.460]   In fact, eventually my mother was able to get a credit card
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:57.360]   in her own name in the 1970s without my father
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.280]   having to co-sign the paperwork.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.180]   It took a long time, but nonetheless,
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:05.920]   the category citizen can expand
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.160]   and it can become a universal category.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:14.160]   So we have that, the citizen universal humanity model
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:18.600]   of the American Revolution, which was deeply flawed
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.920]   at the time it was introduced, but fixable over time.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:26.100]   We also had that separation of powers
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.820]   and constraint on executive power
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.120]   that we began this conversation with.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.720]   That was also institutionalized in the American Revolution
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.040]   because they were afraid of tyranny.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:40.920]   They were afraid of unconstrained executive power.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:44.600]   So they built a system that would contain that,
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.140]   constrain it institutionally, not circumstantially.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.100]   So that's a great gift.
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:54.100]   Within that universal category of citizen,
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:57.400]   which has over time come closer
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.920]   to fulfilling its original promise,
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.680]   and within those institutional constraints,
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:07.000]   that separation of powers, constraint on executive power.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.880]   Within that, we've developed
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.720]   what we might call normal politics, left-right politics.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.900]   People can be in favor of redistribution
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:21.680]   and government action, and people can be in favor
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.800]   of small government, hands-off government,
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.320]   no redistribution or less redistribution.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.520]   That's the normal left-right political spectrum
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.560]   where you respect the institutions
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.120]   and separation of powers,
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:41.120]   and you respect the universal category of citizenship
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.680]   and equality before the law and everything else.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:49.260]   I don't see any problems with that whatsoever.
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:53.120]   I see that as a great gift, not just to this country,
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.560]   but around the world and other places
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.940]   besides the United States have developed this.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.280]   The problems arise at the extremes,
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.920]   the far left and the far right,
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:10.040]   that don't recognize the legitimacy either of capitalism
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.000]   or of democratic rule of law institutions,
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.620]   and they wanna eliminate constraints on executive power.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.600]   They wanna control the public sphere
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.560]   or diminish the independence of the media.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.820]   They wanna take away markets or private property,
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:29.200]   and redistribution becomes something bigger
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.600]   than just redistribution.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.920]   It becomes actually that original Marxist idea
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:37.280]   of transcending capitalism.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.700]   So I'm not bothered by the left or the right.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:45.160]   I think they're normal, and we should have that debate.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.740]   We're a gigantic, diverse country
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:51.040]   of many different political points of view.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.960]   I'm troubled only by the extremes
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:57.400]   that are against the system, class system,
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.960]   that wanna get rid of it, and supposedly
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:03.600]   that will be the bright path to the future.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.600]   History tells us that the far left
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.420]   and the far right are wrong about that.
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.440]   But once again, this doesn't mean
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.020]   that you have to be a social democrat.
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.320]   You could be a libertarian.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:17.260]   You could be a conservative.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:19.040]   You could be a centrist.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.960]   You could be conservative on some issues
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.880]   and liberal on other issues.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.120]   All of that comes under what I would presume
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:29.480]   to be normal politics, and I see that
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.600]   as the important corrective mechanism,
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:35.000]   normal politics and market economies,
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   non-monopolistic, open, free, and dynamic market economies.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.720]   I don't like concentrations of power politically,
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.420]   and I don't like concentrations of power economically.
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:50.080]   I like competition in the political realm.
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.660]   I like competition in the economic realm.
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:55.080]   This is not perfect.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:00.080]   It constantly needs to be protected and reinvented,
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.080]   and there are flaws that are fundamental
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.520]   and need to be adjusted and addressed and everything else,
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.680]   especially equality of opportunity.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:15.680]   Equality of outcome is unreachable and is a mistake
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:20.320]   because it produces perverse and unintended consequences.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:23.400]   Equality of outcome attempts,
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:27.400]   attempts to make people equal on the outcome side,
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:31.100]   but attempts to make them more equal on the front end,
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:34.480]   on the opportunity side, that's really, really important
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.160]   for a healthy society.
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.680]   That's where we've fallen down.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:43.240]   Our schools are not providing equality of opportunity
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:48.240]   for the majority of people in all of our school systems,
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.400]   and so I see problems there.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:55.280]   I see a need to invest in ourselves,
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:59.480]   invest in infrastructure, invest in human capital,
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.680]   create greater equality of opportunity,
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.920]   but also to make sure that we have good governance
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.000]   'cause governance is the variable that enables you
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.320]   to do all these other things.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:14.800]   - I've watched quite a bit, returning back to Putin.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.640]   I've watched quite a few interviews with Putin
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.480]   and conversations, especially because I speak Russian
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.160]   fluently, I can understand.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.520]   Often the translations lose a lot.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:35.800]   I find the man putting morality aside
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.960]   very deep and interesting,
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:43.520]   and I found almost no interview with him
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.840]   to get at that depth.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:50.800]   I was very hopeful for the Oliver Stone documentary
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:55.360]   and with him, and to me, 'cause I deeply respect
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.040]   Oliver Stone as a filmmaker in general,
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.440]   but it was a complete failure in my eyes, that interview.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:07.400]   I mean, I suppose you could toss it up
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:12.200]   to a language barrier, but a complete lack
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:16.240]   of diving deep into the person is what I saw.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.840]   So my question is a strange one,
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.360]   but if you were to sit down with Putin
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:23.720]   and have a conversation,
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:28.040]   or perhaps if you were to sit down with Stalin
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.680]   and have a conversation,
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.720]   what kind of questions would you ask?
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:36.400]   This wouldn't be televised, unless you want it to be.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.800]   So this is only you, so you're allowed to ask
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.920]   about some of the questions that are
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.920]   sort of not socially acceptable.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.560]   Meaning, putting morality aside,
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.640]   getting at the depth of the human character,
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.840]   what would you ask?
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.280]   - So once again, they're very different personalities
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.080]   and very different time periods and very different regimes.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.920]   So what I would talk to Stalin about and Putin about
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.920]   are not in the same category, necessarily.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.520]   So let's take Putin.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:14.040]   So I would ask him where he thinks this is going,
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:20.160]   where he thinks Russia's gonna be in 25 years or 50 years.
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.760]   What's the long-term vision?
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.160]   What does he anticipate the current trends
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.560]   are gonna produce?
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.560]   Is he under the illusion that Russia is on the up swing,
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:36.640]   that things are actually going pretty well,
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   that in 25 years, Russia's gonna still be a great power
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.920]   with a tremendous dynamic economy and a lot of high tech
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.200]   and a lot of human capital and wonderful infrastructure
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:54.200]   and a very high standard of living and a secure borders
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.280]   and sense of security at home?
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.080]   Does he think the current path is leading
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.680]   in that direction?
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:04.680]   And if not, if he understands that the current trajectory
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:11.960]   does not provide for those kinds of circumstances,
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.040]   does it bother him?
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.440]   Does he worry about that?
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:20.280]   Does he care about the future 25 or 50 years from now?
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.360]   - Deep down, what do you think his answer is?
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.200]   The honest answer.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.160]   - Either he thinks he's on that trajectory already
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.600]   or he doesn't care about that long-term trajectory.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.640]   So that's the mystery for me with him.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.280]   He's clever.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.200]   He has tremendous sources of information.
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.960]   He has great experience now as a world leader
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.960]   having served for effectively longer than Leonid Brezhnev's
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.680]   long 18 year reign.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:51.920]   And so Putin has accumulated a great deal of experience
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.640]   at the highest level compared to where he started.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.120]   And so I'm interested to understand how he sees
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:03.880]   this long-term evolution or non-evolution of Russia
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.800]   and whether he believes he's got them
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.640]   on the right trajectory or whether,
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.560]   if he doesn't believe that, he cares.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:15.520]   I have no idea because I've never spoken to him about this,
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.200]   but I would love to hear the answer.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.760]   Sometimes you have to ask questions not directly like that,
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.080]   but you have to come a little bit sideways.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.480]   You can elicit answers from people
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.120]   by making them feel comfortable
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.200]   in coming sideways with them.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.040]   - Anna, just a quick question.
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.000]   So that's talking about Russia, Putin's role in Russia.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.200]   Do you think it's interesting to ask,
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.480]   and you could say the same for Stalin,
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:48.480]   the more personal question of how do you feel yourself
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:53.520]   about this whole thing, about your life, about your legacy,
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:58.080]   looking at the person that's one of the most powerful
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.540]   and important people in the history of civilization,
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:04.560]   both Putin and Stalin, you could argue.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.400]   - Yeah.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.960]   Once you experience power at that level,
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.400]   it becomes something that's almost necessary for you
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.120]   as a human being.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.880]   It's a drug, it's an aphrodisiac, it's a feeling.
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.380]   You know, you go to the gym to exercise,
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:26.440]   and the endorphins, the chemicals get released,
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.660]   and even if you're tired or you're sore,
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:32.960]   you get this massive chemical change
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.040]   which has very dynamic effects on how you feel
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.200]   and the kind of level of energy you have
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.000]   for the rest of the day.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.960]   And if you do that for a long time
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.100]   and then you don't do it for a while,
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:49.700]   you're like a drug addict not getting your fix.
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:53.240]   You miss it, your body misses that release of endorphins
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.080]   to a certain extent.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.880]   That's how power works for people like Putin.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.760]   That's how power works for people who run universities
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.720]   or are secretaries of state
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.860]   or run corporations, fill in the blank.
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:11.320]   In whatever ways power is exercised,
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:14.640]   it becomes almost a drug for people.
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.880]   It becomes something that's difficult for them to give up.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.280]   It becomes a part of who they are.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.700]   It becomes necessary for their sense of self and wellbeing.
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:29.040]   The greatest people, the people I admire the most,
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.800]   are the ones that can step away from power,
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.960]   can give it up, can give up the drug,
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.240]   can be satisfied, can be stronger even
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:41.680]   by walking away from continued power
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.040]   when they had the option to continue.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:47.600]   So with a person like Putin,
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.880]   once again, I don't know him personally
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.620]   so I have no basis to judge this.
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:57.620]   This is a general statement observable with many people
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:00.180]   and in historical terms.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:02.400]   With a person like Putin who's exercised
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:05.040]   this much power for this long,
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.640]   it's something that becomes a part of who you are
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.920]   and you have a hard time imagining yourself without it.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.560]   You begin to conflate your personal power
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.120]   with the wellbeing of the nation.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.480]   You begin to think that the more power you have,
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.840]   the better off the country is, this conflation.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:27.840]   You begin to be able to not imagine.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.940]   You can no longer imagine what it would be like
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:33.420]   just to be an ordinary citizen or an ordinary person
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:35.380]   running a company even,
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:39.000]   something much smaller than a country.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.280]   So I anticipate that, without knowing for sure,
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:47.720]   that he would be in that category of person.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:51.840]   But you'd wanna explore that with questions with him
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.840]   about, so what's his day look like from beginning to end?
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.560]   Just take me through a typical day of yours.
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:00.640]   What do you do in a day?
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.200]   How does it start?
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.020]   What are the ups?
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:03.920]   What are the downs?
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.040]   What are the parts of the day
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.260]   you look forward to the most?
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:08.400]   What are the parts of the day
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.920]   you don't look forward to that much?
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:13.380]   What do you consider a good day?
[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:15.400]   What do you consider a bad day?
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.280]   How do you know that what you're doing
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:22.160]   is having the effects that you intend?
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.680]   How do you follow up?
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:26.600]   How do you gather the information, the reaction?
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.420]   How do you get people to tell you to your face
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:32.000]   things that they know are uncomfortable
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.260]   or that you might not wanna hear?
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:35.100]   Those kind of questions.
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:36.960]   - And through that window,
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.400]   through that kind of questioning,
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.040]   you get a window into a man with power.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.720]   So let me ask about Stalin,
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.420]   'cause you've done more research.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:49.340]   In another amazing interview you've had,
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:55.640]   the introduction was that you know more about Stalin
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.840]   than Stalin himself.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:00.120]   You've done an incredible amount of research on Stalin.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:04.960]   So if you could talk to him, get sort of direct research,
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.680]   what questions would you ask of Stalin?
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.720]   - I have so many questions,
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.240]   I don't even know where I would begin.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.300]   The thing about studying a person like Stalin,
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.040]   who's an immense creature, right?
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.880]   He's exercising the power of life and death
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.400]   over hundreds of millions of people.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.800]   He's making decisions about novels and films
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:31.800]   and turbines and submarines and pacts with Hitler
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.160]   or deals with Churchill and Roosevelt
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:40.160]   and occupation of Mongolia or occupation of North Korea.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:45.600]   He's making phenomenally consequential decisions
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:50.080]   over all spheres of life, all areas of endeavor
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.440]   and over much of the globe,
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.200]   much of the land mass of the earth.
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:58.720]   And so what's that like?
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:03.440]   Does he sometimes reflect on the amount of power
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:07.720]   and responsibility he has that he can exercise?
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.840]   Does he sometimes think about what it means
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.880]   that a single person has that kind of power?
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:18.080]   And does it have an effect on his relations with others,
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.560]   his sense of self, the kinds of things he values in life?
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.920]   Does he sometimes think it's a mistake
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.320]   that he's accumulated this much power?
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.740]   Does he sometimes wish he had a simpler life?
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:35.280]   Or is he once again so drunk, so enamored,
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:40.280]   so caught up with chemically and spiritually
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.520]   with exercising this kind of power
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:45.360]   that he couldn't live without it?
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.520]   And then what were you thinking, I would ask him,
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.120]   in certain decisions that he made?
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.340]   What were you thinking on certain dates
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:56.720]   and certain circumstances where you made a decision
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.080]   and could have made a different decision?
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.320]   Can you recall your thought processes?
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.200]   Can you bring the decision back?
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.040]   Was it seat of the pants?
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.320]   Was it something you'd been planning?
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.640]   Did you just improvise or did you have a strategy?
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.760]   What were you guided by?
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.100]   Whose examples did you look to?
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:19.200]   When you picked up these books that you read
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.320]   and you read the books and you made pencil marks in them,
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.860]   is it because you absorbed the lesson there?
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:27.880]   Or did it really not become a permanent lesson
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.780]   and it was just something that you checked
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:32.300]   and it was like a reflex?
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.120]   So I have many specific questions
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:39.260]   about many specific events and people and circumstances
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:42.520]   that I have tried to figure out
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:45.840]   with the surviving source materials
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.720]   that we have in abundance.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.080]   But I would still like to delve into his mindset
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.800]   and reconstruct his mind.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:57.500]   The closer you get to Stalin in some ways,
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.300]   the more elusive he can become.
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:03.080]   - And especially around World War II,
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:06.120]   you've already illuminated a lot of interesting aspects
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.160]   about Stalin's role in the war,
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:11.240]   but it'd be interesting to ask even more questions
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:13.620]   about how seat of the pants or deliberate
[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:15.480]   some of the decisions have been.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:17.800]   If I could ask just one quick question,
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.140]   one last quick question.
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:22.100]   (mouse clicking)
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:25.220]   And you're constrained in time in answering it.
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:28.660]   Do you think there will always be evil in the world?
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:30.560]   Do you think there will always be war?
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.740]   - Unfortunately, yes.
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:35.860]   There are conflicting interests,
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:39.360]   conflicting goals that people have.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.300]   Most of the time,
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:44.780]   those conflicts can be resolved peacefully.
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:47.540]   That's why we build strong institutions,
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:51.160]   to resolve different interests and conflicts peacefully.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:56.980]   But the fact, the enduring fact of conflicting interests
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:03.900]   and conflicting desires, that can never be changed.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:08.980]   So the job that we have for humanity's sake
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:12.900]   is to make those conflicting interests,
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:16.140]   those conflicting desires,
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:21.140]   to put them in a context where they can be resolved
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:25.540]   peacefully and not in a zero sum fashion.
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:30.380]   So we can't get there on the global scale.
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:34.260]   So there's always gonna be the kind of conflict
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:35.960]   that sometimes gets violent.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.460]   What we don't want is a conflict
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:43.060]   among the strongest powers.
[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:48.060]   Great power conflict is unbelievably bad.
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:50.240]   There are no words to describe it.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:54.420]   At least 55 million people died in World War II.
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:58.040]   If we have a World War III,
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.540]   a war between the United States and China
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:02.660]   or whatever it might be,
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:04.900]   who knows what the number could be?
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:09.900]   155 million, 255 million, 555 million.
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.880]   I don't even wanna think about it.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:17.200]   And so it's horrible when wars break out
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:20.040]   in the humanitarian catastrophes.
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.240]   For example, Yemen and Syria
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.160]   and several other places I could name today.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:28.520]   It's just horrible what you see there.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.000]   And the scale is colossal for those places.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.560]   But it's not planetary scale.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:38.520]   And so avoiding planetary scale destruction
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.880]   is really important for us.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.880]   And so having those different interests
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:48.880]   be somehow managed in a way that they don't,
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:54.040]   that no one sees advantage in a violent resolution.
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.720]   - And a part of that is remembering history.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.400]   So they should read your books.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:59.640]   Stephen, thank you so much.
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:01.320]   It was a huge honor talking to you today.

[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:36.040]   And now let me leave you with words from Joseph Stalin.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.200]   Spoken shortly before the death of Lenin
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:41.400]   and at the beginning of Stalin's rise to power.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.160]   First, in Russian.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:48.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:59.320]   I consider it completely unimportant
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:02.280]   who in the party will vote or how,
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:05.640]   but what is extraordinarily important
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.560]   is who will count the votes and how.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:12.880]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:15.480]   (upbeat music)
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:18.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:28.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
