[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   A number of listeners to this podcast listen with their children, which is awesome.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.520]   But today in this episode, we're going to talk about pornography.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.020]   So just an alert there.
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.960]   This is a common question we get a lot of times in the inbox, and it's a sobering one.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.960]   Here it is.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.800]   "Should a pastor who uses pornography resign from his leadership role?"
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.520]   Now this is also a question that the Barna researchers recently asked about 3,000 Christians
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.140]   in a study produced in partnership with Josh McDowell Ministries earlier in 2016.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.820]   And when they asked the question, only 8% of pastors said yes, that a pastor using porn
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.580]   should resign.
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.920]   But when the question was asked to adult Christians, 41% of them said yes, a pastor should be fired
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.980]   or asked to resign in this situation.
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.000]   So obviously this huge disparity is a cause for concern alone about sexual assent in pastoral
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.840]   ministry it seems.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.720]   Pastor John, how do you read these numbers, the 8% and the 41%, and how would you answer
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.120]   the question yourself?
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.560]   Well, what appalls me in those statistics is not the disparity, but how low both figures
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   are.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.560]   Yeah, good point.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.080]   I mean, 8% is inconceivable.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.800]   They must have asked the question in a peculiar way.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.720]   I can't believe that number.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.800]   41%, maybe, but both of them in my opinion are appallingly low.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.380]   And your question is, well, what do you think and why?
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.320]   So if I were on a leadership team, that is if I were a fellow elder of a pastor and it
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.240]   came to my attention that he was looking at pornography, say on the internet, or worse
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.680]   kind of involvements, I suppose, though they're all terrible, I would try to follow the steps
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.040]   of Matthew 18 and go to with the informant to talk to him personally, privately.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:59.140]   And from that point on, whether he should step down from his pastoral role, either to
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:08.880]   an extended leave or resignation, depends in part on whether this was an isolated incident
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.040]   or a pattern.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.800]   If all the other evidences of qualification for the eldership in the New Testament were
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:26.160]   present, and this incident proved to be an aberration of his consistent purity of heart,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.880]   purity of eyes, purity of relationships, then I would try to resolve it privately with his
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.480]   wife and the other elders.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.520]   And yes, I do think we should draw in the other elders at this point, even though Matthew
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.780]   18 isn't talking about that.
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.080]   And the reason is that I think whether a leader is willing to be vulnerable and accountable
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.280]   to his leadership team, the fellow elders, is crucial to know.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.680]   If he's resistant to that, it's a very bad sign.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:08.040]   But if the incident proves to be an ongoing habit of watching pornography, I do regard
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.180]   him as unqualified for the pastoral ministry, the eldership.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.060]   And I would encourage him to resign and undertake all the biblical strategies of liberation
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.360]   that he can amass.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.040]   And behind that position are two convictions.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.120]   One has to do with leadership qualifications in the New Testament, and the other has to
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.280]   do with the nature of grace.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.760]   The first conviction about leadership qualifications is that pastors, overseers, elders, whatever
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.600]   term a church uses for their leaders, in the New Testament, they are called to have a higher
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.880]   standard of moral and spiritual qualification than the church members as a whole.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.120]   And you can see those qualifications laid out in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.840]   And when I try to contemplate how a man could be qualified to lead the church as one who
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.860]   has been unable to conquer the temptation of pornography, I can't imagine that such
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.360]   a person is qualified.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.640]   I'm going to list all the reasons here that I'm drawing out of those qualifications from
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.640]   the New Testament.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.280]   He's, in essence, being disrespectful at best and unfaithful at worst to his wife.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.300]   He's defiling his heart time after time and falling short of having a pure heart that
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.640]   can see God.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.440]   Blessed are the pure in heart that can see God.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.320]   How can you lead a people if you can't see God for who he really is and are constantly
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.360]   defiling your ability to see the Lord?
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.740]   He's making it very difficult for himself to look at women in the church with any purity.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.360]   The flock that he's called to care for without seeing them in some contaminated way as those
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.780]   images are corrupting his mind.
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.800]   He's manifesting a lack of self-control, which is explicit in the qualification list.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.080]   If the outsiders knew what he was doing, he wouldn't be well thought of.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.520]   No, he wouldn't.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.360]   Even the world would not regard such a man as fit to be a spiritual leader of men and
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.360]   women.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.440]   They might regard him as normal like everybody else, but they wouldn't.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.520]   They wouldn't say that such a man should be a spiritual leader.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.920]   In the New Testament, qualifications for elders are given about not being addicted to wine
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.840]   and not being lovers of money.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   That's interesting.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:52.080]   When you take money and wine, in other words, he's saying you're unqualified if the temptation
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.240]   of wine and the temptation of money overcome you.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:04.520]   Well, if money and wine knock you out of the ministry, how much more the inability to overcome
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.640]   the temptation to pornography.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.280]   I say more, I say worse, because these are real women on the screen.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.800]   This is a pastor.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.000]   These are real women.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   They have souls.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.960]   They're going to heaven or hell.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.080]   They have mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers whose relationships are being
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.040]   ruined by these lives.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.320]   This is just incomprehensible to me that anybody could defend their fitness for ministry while
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.760]   engaging in a regular way with this kind of thing.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.680]   When it becomes known in the church, and it will become known in the church, that he is
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.120]   a user, how will his credibility in the preaching of holiness and purity and obedience to Christ
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.340]   have any credibility or weight at all?
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.280]   The fact that the New Testament elevates the qualifications for leadership in the church
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.620]   above what is expected of all Christians, and even those are high, makes it difficult
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:07.260]   to imagine how a pastor in a pattern of pornography could be qualified to lead the flock of God
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.100]   into a more holy and pure walk with God, which is what his job is at its heart.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.240]   Now, I said there were two convictions behind my position, and the other one is just a short
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.900]   word about a view of grace.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:28.160]   Of course there is forgiveness for such sin, just like there's forgiveness for all of us,
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:35.520]   and grace is eager to offer it to a penitent, humble pastor.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:43.020]   But when grace operates in community, not just one-on-one, but in community, it takes
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:49.340]   into account not just an individual who needs forgiveness, but a church that needs protection,
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:55.860]   gracious protection, a church that needs godly examples in leadership, graciously needs godly
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:03.460]   examples in leadership, and thus grace toward the people will result in the removal of the
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.460]   leader.
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.220]   People don't get that lots of times, that grace is not a simple thing of just one-on-one.
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.660]   There's more people involved than just one.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:17.340]   So because of those two convictions, I would encourage pastors who are in a pattern of
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.460]   pornography to step down.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.620]   That is a hard truth, but a necessary word for the health of our churches.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.980]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:44.160]   So should we be killing sin or should we be relaxing in grace?
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160]   How does sanctification work?
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.860]   It's a perennial question we get in the inbox, and John Piper will answer it on Friday.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.860]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
