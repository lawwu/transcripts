[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Pastor John, over the months we have a pile of email questions from listeners who want
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.280]   to know about the certain boundaries we should have in place as Christians.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.060]   Regarding our friendships with non-Christians, what are some categories to keep in mind here?
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.800]   Where would you draw the lines?
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:31.880]   We have to find the line between ignoring two seemingly opposite commands.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.080]   One is, "Do not be deceived.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.280]   Bad company ruins good morals," 1 Corinthians 15:33.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760]   Or "Your boasting is not good.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.080]   Do you not know a little leaven leavens the whole lump?"
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.760]   Paul is talking about tolerating people in the church that you should excommunicate.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.040]   Now on the other side, "Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.640]   fools will suffer harm," Proverbs 13.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.880]   "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, stands not in the way of sinners,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.360]   sits not in the seats of scoffers."
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.880]   So you've got all these commands and wisdom proverbs on the one side that say, "Watch
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.880]   out.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.240]   Hanging out with corrupt people can lead to your corruption."
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.240]   Now on the other side, of course, you've got Jesus, who not only ate with tax collectors
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.720]   and sinners, but he was called the friend of tax collectors and sinners because that's,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.160]   in fact, what he did so often.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.200]   And you've got Paul saying, "If you take me as me—when I say don't hang out or separate
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.160]   yourself from sexually immoral people, if you think I mean the world, then that won't
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.120]   work because then you'd have to go out of the world," 1 Corinthians 5.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.180]   He doesn't mean don't associate with greedy swindlers, idolaters, since then you would
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.440]   need to go out of the world, he says in 1 Corinthians 5.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.960]   So Paul is with Jesus in saying, "No, you're going to be thrown together with these people.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   You should take opportunities.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.720]   You should become all things to all people in a biblical way."
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:20.640]   So we've got these two sets of admonitions, and we have to discern which ones apply when.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.480]   And I would say, ask these two questions.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.680]   Which way is the transforming influence flowing?
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.140]   When you're with someone, are they being transformed?
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.800]   Are you being transformed?
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.560]   Are you being drawn to minimize the value of holiness?
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.700]   Are your standards being compromised?
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.720]   Are you being made callous and hard towards things in movies, say, or on television, or
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.840]   in language that you weren't once hard to but sensitive to?
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.480]   So that's the first question.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.680]   And the second question is, are we loving these people for their sake—that is, that
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.400]   they would come to faith and they would become godly—or do we really love them because
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.000]   we love what they enjoy and really just like being with them in their worldliness?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I think a lot of people justify hanging out with worldly people because they are worldly
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.300]   Christians and they feel at home with those worldly Christians.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.680]   And the things they laugh at, they don't regard as offensive.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.280]   The things they watch in movies, they don't regard as a problem.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.800]   The language they use, they don't think it's a big deal.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.720]   The way they spend their time, that's the way they'd like to spend their time, which
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.080]   really shows that they're not loving these people with a Christlike love that's ready
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.600]   to die to change their behavior and change their patterns.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.320]   They're just conforming to them and calling it love.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:04.600]   So those are the two questions that I think help us navigate between bad company corrupts
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.200]   good morals on the one hand, and Jesus eating with tax collectors and sinners on the other
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   hand.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   Yes.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   Thank you, Pastor John.
