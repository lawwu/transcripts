[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.600]   2023 bestie awards. This is where everybody goes crazy. Oh

[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.520]   champagne with me? I need some champagne popping. What are you
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.280]   guys drinking? These are the awards. Everybody wants to know
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.160]   who's going to be a winner.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.720]   You're right. I need a drink. Hold on.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.760]   He needs a drink for this.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.760]   I need a drink too. Can you can I go get a drink? Hang on.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.280]   Everybody get a drink. Loosen it up.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.120]   I'm at my office. I don't have alcohol here.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.360]   Look at the second draw.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:43.840]   All right, everybody. Welcome to the bestie awards for 2023.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.240]   What are you drinking? I got a little Vove Clicquot. You know,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.720]   I love you actually gonna drink it.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.120]   You know, I people don't know this about me. But that was my
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.720]   beverage of choice was the old Vove Clicquot when I would go out
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.000]   in New York. What have you got there? sacks? What are you
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.320]   drinking for the 2023 bestie awards? What are you drinking?
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.920]   I'm drinking my classes all reposado. And the class with a
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.160]   single big rock and I broke out my patriotic great seal the
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.600]   United States class.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.760]   This is a tribute to the border. You got a little bit of Mexico
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.200]   a little bit of the United States. And is it flowing
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.560]   between the border and you is that it's open border now?
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.480]   The border is completely open at this point.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.200]   Gotcha. Okay. Just flooding in. You're not drinking. You're at
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.120]   the office. Free. But I mean, I didn't plan. I brought my props
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.920]   to wish everybody Happy Holidays.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.520]   Amazing. Freeberg. Everybody knows that you're a quiet solo
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.480]   drinker and your darkest hours. What are you drinking? surprises
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.440]   there? What are you drinking?
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.680]   I'm always drinking when I got to hang out with you Jake. I'm
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.200]   drinking a Victoria Victoria. Actually, yeah, I don't think
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.440]   you hang out with Jake house over. Oh, everybody. There it
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.080]   is. We've got the Vove Clicquot. Unfortunately, at my ski house,
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.520]   I can't find the flute. So I'm gonna put this in a wineglass.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.240]   Sorry for the sacrilege. But cheers. Here's to another amazing
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.560]   year of the all in podcast and the besties hanging out. Cheers.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.000]   You want to say a few words, Jake? Like, I'd like to say a
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.520]   few words in memoriam of the year. Yes, working with you guys
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.240]   has been delightful, miserable and everything in between.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.680]   Congratulations on all of our success. And here's to an
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.280]   amazing 2024. And hopefully we find a CEO and we can keep this
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.080]   thing going for another 150 or so episodes. Nobody thought we
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.920]   would get here. Everybody hates us for our success. And the
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.000]   mids and the haters. Love you besties.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.720]   Cheers. I would like to make a toast. Here we go. Here is to
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.520]   three of the most talented, friendly guys. And Jacob
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.920]   format for me.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.760]   Mr. Action. Don't ever forget it, brother.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.000]   All right. Well, to three of the most sincere, heartfelt,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.880]   intelligent, loving individuals and David sacks. Welcome to the
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.760]   program. Here for you. And let's just get to it. We're going to
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.440]   give our 2023 award for the biggest winner in politics last
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.920]   year. Chamath, you said that your prediction for 2023. Now
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.160]   we're going to give the actual word for 2033. But in our
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.280]   predictions episode last year, you said you were long Nikki
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.240]   Alley and short to Santa's what a prescient call. What do you
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.520]   have this year? That's Brett trade paid off in spades. Yeah,
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.360]   but expression. Looking back, I think the biggest political
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.240]   winner was Donald Trump. Okay. I think that the documents case
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.240]   galvanized his leadership in the Republican nomination. And I
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.000]   think that this move by the Colorado Supreme Court basically
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.400]   sealed the deal. I think he is going to run away with the
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   Republican nomination. And barring some catastrophic
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.560]   meltdown has a better chance to get into the White House than
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.480]   before this Colorado case. So he was the biggest political winner,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.520]   I think of 2023. It just seems to me that if I had to really
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.120]   put it in a nutshell, I think that the the Dems in this weird
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.360]   way, actually want Trump back in office more than the Republicans
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.360]   do, because everything they've done has been near sighted, and
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.760]   I think has actually galvanized his support and increased his
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.760]   popularity and his ability to fundraise more than anything
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.880]   else. Friedberg, who is your biggest political winner of
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.120]   2023? Who did I give it to last year? Do you remember? You gave
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.680]   it to MBS, and Saudi, that they would have the your prediction
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.800]   was they would have a year in the monarchy. But in some ways, I
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.480]   think they are center stage. That's what I thought. So I am
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.000]   giving my biggest winner. I'm giving my biggest political
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.360]   winner award to the nation state of Saudi Arabia. Oh, like they
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.680]   are sitting in the middle of the US, China, Iran, Israel, Russia,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.800]   they have relations with all of those nations and relations
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.560]   where they are trying to be productive, extraordinary
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.640]   leverage with both their capital, their geographic
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.200]   positioning and their energy resourcing, and painting a very
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.960]   positive future on how they want to reinvest their capital and
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.720]   modernize the country. And I think one of the biggest coups
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   that they pulled this year was turning J Cal to being a big
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.280]   promoter of Saudi after his visit to the Middle East. And so
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.320]   I think they're entering 2024 with great strength and
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.440]   leverage. So I give them credit for riding out many storms this
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.840]   year and coming out ahead. So it's just it's been interesting
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.600]   to watch. I'm not I'm not close or tied to them in any way. But
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.800]   I just think from a global leverage point of view, they
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.960]   seem to be in a very strong place. So that's my, my award.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.320]   I can't disagree with you that the place has made incredible
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:12.680]   progress, personal freedoms, economic freedoms, their the
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.640]   country is evolving and embracing every country on the
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.200]   planet, right? So you have to take that as a win. I have no
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.880]   business interests there, but I am impressed with the progress.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.560]   So sacks that means it's your turn to give us your 2023
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.360]   biggest winner.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.920]   My biggest winner in politics, Jake, I think you'll like this
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.560]   one is abortion rights.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.400]   abortion rights,
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.280]   abortion rights after Dobbs abortion rights are winning on
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.000]   every battle where they're at issue. It's one referenda in
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.280]   very red states like Kansas, Kentucky, Montana and Ohio. It's
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.080]   swung legislatures to the Dems and swing states like Michigan,
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.280]   Pennsylvania, Virginia. It's swung states from court races in
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.160]   Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. I'd go so far as to say it's the
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.280]   Democrats only winning issue and they are putting it on the
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.440]   ballot everywhere they can. Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out around
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.320]   30 years ago that we likely could have reached this
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.280]   resolution decades ago, if the courts hadn't stolen the issue
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.680]   from the political process, because abortion rights were in
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.440]   the process of being liberalized everywhere. And in my view, the
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.920]   political process is messy, but it's how we finally move past
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.760]   the issue as a nation, which is why I think Dobbs was the right
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.520]   decision, even if it was a difficult one.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.840]   Huh, interesting. So you are smoothing over Trump's taking
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.720]   away the right for women to choose and saying that this is a
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.680]   net positive for the country, if I'm reading it correctly.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.680]   Well, Trump didn't take anything away. That's true. Lord, people
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.560]   like Courtney. This is gone on. I just explained it. You're not
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.600]   listening. Supreme Court gave the issue back to the democratic
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.720]   process. The democratic process is now voting to maintain
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.400]   abortion rights. And that is going to settle the issue once
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.720]   and for all. So just think for all of your fears that abortion
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.720]   rights would fall by the wayside, because that's from
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.880]   court decision have actually proven to be null and void. What
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.000]   we're ending up with is a better solution, where the country
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.960]   doesn't need to fight about this anymore, because the voters have
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.160]   expressed the will of the people.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.200]   Fantastic framing. Great save for the Republican Party there.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.000]   Well, it won't be unless they learn how to talk about the
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.840]   issue. Yeah, I mean, the way I would frame the same issue is
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.280]   that Trump stack the deck to take away women's right to
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.040]   choose in order to get elected, but your framing is pretty good
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.360]   too. And you're a master of framing these things. So I was
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.800]   torn here for mine. I had two different choices. I was either
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.560]   gonna go with Nikki Haley, because what an amazing feat for
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.960]   her to even be getting close to Trump in some of these primaries.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.480]   But I think really the biggest winners in this year of 2023
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.920]   were non traditional candidates, actually becoming somewhat
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.800]   viable and capturing the imagination of young people. The
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.080]   vague RFK Dean Phillips being I think the three leading
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.040]   candidates. So I'm going to go with the non traditional
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:11.240]   candidates being the big winners for 2023. And for last year, I
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.880]   had said that my prediction was for 2023, was that Trump would
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.600]   get indicted, win the nomination, and then agree to
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.760]   not run because he gets a pardon. So I think I've got two
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.240]   or three of those in the parlay in the bag. Let's go on to
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.800]   biggest loser, the biggest loser in politics. When we did our
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.920]   predictions for 2023. Chamath, you said that you were short to
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.680]   Santas. Here we are, we're giving our actual award for the
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.800]   biggest political loser in 2023. Freeberg, I'll start with
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.120]   you. Who is your biggest political loser for 2023?
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.240]   My biggest political loser is the DEI movement. Huh? I heard,
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.000]   obviously, post October 7, the Hamas attacks on Israel. And
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.120]   then the following support for Hamas, that came out of what
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.160]   have historically been groups that are aligned with DEI
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.480]   interests, and then the DEI driven leaders of the
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.400]   universities that went in front of Congress to defend their
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:20.160]   freedom of speech rules around anti semitic protests, caused a
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.320]   lot of folks that I know who are very liberal and very
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.600]   influential, to wake up to the negative impacts of the DEI
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.960]   movement, and its linkage to potentially anti semitism, which
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.440]   is masked in this oppressor oppressed ideology. That is the
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.520]   basis of a lot of these DEI protocols. And so I think it
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.640]   really shined a negative light on DEI this year in a way that
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.080]   hasn't been the case in a broader way with very
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.760]   influential people in a very long time. And so I think that
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.280]   that movement is going to take a big hit and took a big hit at
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.480]   the end of this year, and will continue to, I think, be
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.400]   questioned by donors and supporters of the ideologies of
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:56.920]   that movement.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.440]   Okay, sacks, who is your biggest loser in politics for 2023?
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.040]   My biggest loser in politics for this year is Vladimir
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.360]   Zelensky, the President of Ukraine. And you can see this
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.400]   pretty clearly by just looking at the cover of Time magazine,
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.200]   he began the year, fresh off of winning Time magazine's Person
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.520]   of the Year. And by the end of the year, the same author at
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.680]   Time magazine was writing a new cover story, saying that
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.720]   Zelensky had become delusional, he had become messianic, he was
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.520]   ordering his troops on suicide missions, and his own inner
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.960]   circle had turned on him. And of course, who could forget that
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.440]   other photo from the middle of the year, at Vilnius, when all
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.840]   those euro snobs turned their back on Zelensky. That was a
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.040]   brutal image that went viral on social media, literally the
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.160]   European elite turning their backs on a frustrated Zelensky.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:58.080]   Sadly, Zelensky had the opportunity in April of 2022, to
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.560]   make peace to sign a peace deal. And unfortunately, he took
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.560]   Boris Johnson and Joe Biden's advice to pressure Putin, rather
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.960]   than make peace. And I think that gamble has turned into a
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.760]   disaster for him.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.080]   Chumath, your biggest political loser in 2023?
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.360]   I had a different choice. But I think
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.640]   game time change?
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.400]   Yeah, hearing David has convinced me I will, I will go
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.600]   with the death of the acronyms. It was it was close for me
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   between that. And I actually think that Joe Biden
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.800]   unfortunately, had a very difficult run of it. In 2023.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.880]   When you actually think about it, the Ukraine thing was a
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.000]   fiasco, all of this stuff around maybe putting the hand on the
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.600]   scale, whether it's on Elon or against Donald Trump, it's all
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.120]   just very messy, I think for him. But I do think that
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.800]   Freiburg is right, this is probably the beginning of the
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   end of the acronyms. And if you look at ESG and DEI together,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.880]   ESG is a little bit more measurable, but sustainable
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.680]   asset ownership and ESG ownership across the world
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.920]   shrank by 15%, which you may say, is that a big number or
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   not? That's $5 trillion. And so where the money goes, typically,
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.800]   so goes everything else in modern society. And so when the
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.600]   money starts to scurry, I think that you can pretty much expect
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.000]   that people's patience and support of these kinds of
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.440]   movements are waning. I'll go with death of the acronyms are
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.200]   the biggest. So you started you were going to say Biden, but you
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   changed it in real time. And you went DEI ESG acronyms, acronyms,
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.440]   and okay, death of the acronyms. You know, I had a lot of talks
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.720]   with folks about this one. People had a lot of input. Some
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.920]   people said to Santa, some people said Biden, I think the
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.880]   biggest 2023 loser in politics is the American people who are
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.920]   now faced with a Biden Trump rematch. Both of those
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.520]   individuals clearly being in different stages of decline
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.680]   being over 80. And the GOP just can't quit Trump. And it seems
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:07.320]   like the Democrats can't quit Biden, despite 70 80% of the
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.720]   country not wanting the rematch. So I'm going to give the
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.680]   American people are the biggest political losers of 2023. All
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.120]   right, here we go. biggest political surprise. This is the
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.520]   biggest political surprise of 2023. sacks. What's your biggest
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.440]   political surprise?
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.440]   Well, I think the biggest political surprise and it was a
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.160]   very negative one was the Hamas attack on Israel on the morning
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.200]   of October 7, which really seemed to come out of nowhere.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.800]   Only eight days before Jake Sullivan, who's Biden's
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.120]   National Security Advisor had declared that the Middle East
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.280]   had been quieter than it had been in two decades. And those
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.360]   words, obviously, prove prove very old time, but he wasn't
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.600]   alone in thinking that I think almost everybody was really
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.080]   surprised by this attack. I think until then, the Middle
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.480]   East seemed to be on a path of progress with the Abraham
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.680]   Accords being negotiated between Israel and several Gulf
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.160]   monarchies. And I think that October 7 has really changed the
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.120]   political paradigm, certainly in Israel in the Middle East, and I
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.240]   think even in American politics.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.840]   Okay.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.280]   Freeberg a little bit of a nuanced take on that. But I said
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.760]   the rise of Hamas was the biggest political surprise. You
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.080]   know, Hamas is a self proclaimed political party that was thrust
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.640]   to the center of geopolitics and domestic social issues across
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.160]   the west after October 7, which was, I think, probably a
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.320]   surprise to many that planned these attacks as well. Basically,
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.920]   it feels to me like Hamas is the pawn that crossed the chess
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.960]   board and became a queen. It's an organization that, you know,
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.040]   had resourcing and was influenced by, you know, many
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.160]   have shown connections to Iran and other wealthy states and had
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.320]   very low attention levels prior to October 7, on a global basis
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.880]   and post October 7, now has recognition, and sympathy and a
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.520]   great deal of interest in the root cause of their party. So
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.720]   really incredible surprise. I don't think anyone could have
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.800]   predicted this at the start of the year that not just the
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.840]   attacks happened, but the resulting shift in the discourse
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.920]   and influence that's happened to my biggest political surprise
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.840]   of 2023. I'm going to go with
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:22.120]   a domestic choice. And I think it's quite obvious. But the
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.320]   biggest political surprises are of Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy,
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:32.680]   Jr. I don't think anybody would have predicted that he would
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.560]   both drop out of the Democratic Party run as an independent and
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.240]   essentially, collect. He is, in terms of favorability in the
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.040]   polls. He's the leading 2024 candidate right now. It's
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.840]   incredible. People like him. That's for sure. And nobody
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.040]   would have predicted. That's a really good one. What do we
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.480]   think he will get if he runs as an independent just percentage
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.960]   wise, Ross Perot as a third party can get 19% you think
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.360]   better than 19% because the country is much more fragmented
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.720]   today. There's a lot more protest votes today. There's
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.040]   just a lot of reasons where RFK can garner a lot of support and
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.960]   build a plurality among centrists. That wasn't possible.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.600]   But when Perot was running, because when he ran, you have to
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.960]   remember, like just the country was in a very different place
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.400]   psychologically than it is right now.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.360]   Yeah, I too had third party candidates as being my biggest
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.000]   surprise. I didn't give it to a specific one. I was debating
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.720]   these third party candidates against the GOP not being able
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.240]   to field a better option than Trump. But I think I'm going to
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.960]   go again with third party candidates. But I'll include
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.200]   Dean Phillips in that breaking ranks. I'll include Vivek. Just
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.240]   a very young, very smart individual capturing people's
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.600]   imagination. third party candidates, for me is the
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.040]   biggest surprise. And I do think it could have a meaningful
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.560]   impact if you're right that he gets over 19%. Who does that?
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.360]   Chamath in your mind? Who does that benefit? And who does it
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.600]   hurt? If the candidates are Biden and Trump? It hurts by the
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.200]   most. You believe that? Okay. What about you, Saxe? What do
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.080]   you think it hurts the most?
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.200]   Unclear right now? Yeah. I mean, I think on the issues, I can
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.960]   see a lot of populist voters wanting to go with RFK. But on
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.840]   the other hand, maybe he does peel away some Democratic Party
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.880]   voters. So I'm not sure to be honest.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.480]   I've heard this before. Any thoughts, Friedberg on that?
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.920]   What's the question? If RFK were to get as Chamath thinks more
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.240]   than Perot, so that's 20% or more of the popular vote, who is
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.960]   that going to harm? And who's it going to hurt Trump or Biden?
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.000]   I saw a Gallup survey that showed that there's a real shot
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.760]   at more than 40% of Americans being interested in the third
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.040]   party. And so I'm sorry, I could be totally wrong on that. But I
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.440]   pretty sure I saw that and it really kind of resonated with
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.840]   me. And I think our discourse here and you know, obviously
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.280]   conversations with our friend group, Nick might have something
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.080]   on this support for third US political party up to 63%. This
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.520]   is the Gallup data. Yeah, so I was right. I think that this is
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.120]   one of the most kind of profound shifts in American politics, at
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.640]   least in our lifetimes, that the right has gone very right, the
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.120]   left has gone very left. And they've been so rooted in
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.400]   identity politics, that you can't really see any of these
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.680]   issues kind of finding compromise and finding a way to
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.920]   lean across the aisle and get things done. And I think that's
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.120]   where a lot of people are just fed up. So I would love to see a
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.520]   third political party emerge. And if RFK breaks the dam on
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.320]   this, it would be fantastic. It will take as these things
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.360]   always do a number of years for a group of independents to
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.640]   coalesce around what that third party looks like, and how it's
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.440]   going to be governed and so on. But this could be a really
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.840]   interesting shift in the dynamics of American politics.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.440]   So pretty, pretty cool. I'm not into politics in the US that
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   much, but pretty cool. I think opportunity to reframe, you
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.960]   know, how do we want to build America going forward, and
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.560]   thinking about using a new party as a way to do that. And
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.800]   we haven't even heard of no labels, the third party
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.200]   platform, they're probably going to announce Joe Manchin
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.080]   any day now. And so that could change things as well. So
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.280]   that's a very interesting take.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   Biggest problem that we have, this may sound really dumb, but
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.200]   I think it's true in launching a third party is a viable name.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:22.320]   I think it's the most important boundary condition to have a
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.920]   sustainable third party is a is a good name. Like an iconic
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.360]   person, the charity, like whatever we call this name of
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.440]   the party, not like person, they feel no labels is a terrible
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.520]   name, a terrible name. Green Party is terrible. Green Party
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.240]   is terrible. The Green Party Freedom Party, they're all
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.720]   terrible, because they all feel like they're rooted in some,
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.480]   you know, either conservative or liberal cause, there's got to
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.760]   be some element of like, what's the right decision on each on
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.400]   each topic, not necessarily, you know, how do we fight the
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.840]   identity politics? I think that's the key piece that's
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.120]   missing. And I like the rational party, like a party of
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.720]   national individuals, disparaging to a degree, you
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.480]   know, yeah, branding, branding. So what would you call it? The
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.200]   third party? Republicans?
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.280]   People's Republic of
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.760]   Sax Stan, do you have an idea for a name? I'm not gonna
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:23.520]   comment on this. Something brewing? Would you have a name
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.200]   for a third party? You like the rational party, the rational
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.360]   party or something like that, where it kind of evoked? You
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.920]   know, people who are being thoughtful, and we're trying to
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.120]   make rational decisions in everybody's best interest,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.320]   right? Something that was not about us versus them abortion,
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.960]   you know, ti areas, g just something focused more on
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.800]   getting things done, they getting things done party,
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   something like that getting things done party.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.920]   So she has a nose, but better than the derangement party.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.160]   Yeah, absolutely. All right, let's keep going. Let's keep
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.320]   going. Here we go. He's only trying to derail the show. I
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.680]   will not engage with. All right, it's time for our biggest
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.640]   business winner, biggest winner in business. Who you got your
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.400]   mouth? Who's your biggest winner in business?
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.440]   I mean, I don't think this is even close. But I think it's
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.960]   Elon Musk. Oh,
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.920]   three things, obviously, three different companies. But the
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.440]   rebasing of Twitter actually had an even more profound impact, I
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.960]   think, on Silicon Valley than it necessarily did on Twitter.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.960]   Second was, I think SpaceX has really turned a corner Starlink
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.360]   is really at scale. Starship looks like it's viable. And then
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.160]   the third is Tesla really consolidated its leadership in
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.160]   EVs, and batteries and battery technology and FSD. So I think
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.680]   on the merits, it was not even close.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.120]   Okay, so you got who's your biggest business winner?
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.640]   The magnificent seven. These are the seven companies that
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.320]   accounted for almost all of the stock market gains this year,
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.560]   you can see it in this chart. It's about a 63% gap between the
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:14.080]   performance of the top names, top seven names in the S&P 500.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:21.160]   And then the other 493 of them. I think that the S&P 493 had a 12%
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.880]   gain this year, which isn't bad, but it was dwarfed by the
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.000]   munition seven, which was almost 80%.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.160]   Incredible. All right, Zack says the M seven, Freeberg, who you
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.440]   got?
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.640]   Yeah, I'm gonna pick one of the seven, which is Microsoft just a
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.240]   shot down the middle of the fairway here. Despite only
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.280]   seeing, I think, roughly 8% top line growth, the business saw
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.200]   its market cap grow by over a trillion dollars 1.7 to 2.7
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.480]   trillion this year, just an incredible number. I mean, can
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.200]   you imagine if we ever said that 10 years ago, whether anyone
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.040]   would believe it, consumer and enterprise strength and
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.520]   strategic strength, the fact that they were able to close the
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.360]   activism acquisition in the sort of regulatory environment. And
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.280]   then the strength that Satya showed and the speed at which he
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.640]   acted during the open AI weekend debacle, where he set up this
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.040]   whole thing where he got Sam on board and was going to retain
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.960]   all this value that he was extracting from open AI and
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:19.040]   partnership was, I think, great leadership and cemented his, his
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.640]   position and standing as being a really thoughtful, fast acting
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   strategic leader for a business that's been around forever, but
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.960]   amazingly added a trillion of market cap in 12 months. So I
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.280]   just throw it to Microsoft this year, it's very hard to kind of
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.560]   break that business apart and say, here's all the things that
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.960]   are wrong with it. It's just, you know, it's just moving.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.400]   All right, very well done. We got Elon. Didn't you work there
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.800]   for a while? One year at Twitter? No, in Microsoft,
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.680]   Microsoft, Microsoft, one year.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.120]   I was actually no, I was locked up for two years in the wake of
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.040]   the ember deal. Yeah, I was a corporate vice president
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.800]   Microsoft. You like it? Yeah, it was. I mean, it's a high
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.480]   quality company for sure. Yeah. I mean, I was like super active
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.560]   for one year because I was still in charge of I still had a P&L
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.040]   running Yammer. But then after one year, Yammer was sort of
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.200]   assimilated into the board. And yeah, I didn't have anything to
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.560]   do. I was kind of just like on call. Right, right.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.880]   All right, I am going to talk my own book on this one and give it
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.480]   to Dara and the team at Uber, they got into the S&P 500 became
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.080]   profitable, planning stock buybacks, they resolved almost
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:29.120]   all the regulatory reza issues, including getting the taxis in
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.480]   London to be on the app, which was their big adversary, and
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.520]   they were going to get kicked out of London. If you remember,
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.720]   this is a company that five years ago, the press, and the
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.480]   fake news were saying could never be profitable and was
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.160]   going to fail. And now it is the most successful new startup in
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.600]   the last cycle, bigger than everybody. And so congratulations
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.120]   to the team over there. All right, biggest loser in
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.440]   business. The biggest loser. It's 2023. Freeberg, just so you
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.840]   know, last year, your prediction was capital intensive series B
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.880]   C's and D's of growth companies. Well done on that prediction.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.040]   But give me freeberg your actual Who was your biggest loser in
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.680]   2023? Oh, Sultan of science,
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.440]   it's sort of tied up. Obviously, there's a tail to the effect,
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.680]   but it's VCs who deployed most of their capital in 2021.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.320]   Obviously, it was the year where venture capital deployments
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:28.320]   peaked. And what I've heard from institutional peas this year, is
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.280]   that, you know, not only will that vintage underperform, but
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.240]   it could torpedo as many as 50% of firms that are managing
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.360]   capital today in Silicon Valley. And it could switch the capital
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.400]   allocation model that reduces allocation to venture as an
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.600]   asset class significantly because of the torpedo that the
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.240]   2021 vintage represents in performance. So that was my
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.240]   biggest loser for the year.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.160]   Good for me and sacks because we were diligent during that time.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.520]   All right, let's go to you sacks. Your biggest loser in
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.800]   business in 2023.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.760]   My biggest business loser is Disney. It seems that every
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:12.200]   aspect of Disney's business, the bed in 2023. I mean, all their
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.400]   major theatrical releases flopped amidst a conservative
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.560]   backlash against its woke social stances. You may recall that the
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.440]   actress who played Snow White in the remake accused Prince
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.800]   Charming of being a stalker.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.680]   I mean, there's a million examples,
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.520]   even their their Marvel franchise suddenly had bombs,
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.640]   they had to fire Jonathan Majors, who was doing a fantastic
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.920]   job playing Kang and an entire franchise arc, they're gonna
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.240]   have to reset now because of a criminal conviction involving
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.960]   him. Disney Plus subscriptions fell off a cliff, even
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.920]   attendance at its theme parks declined dramatically because
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.200]   they charge way too much for families to visit. And then
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.720]   finally, Bob Iger picked a fight with Elon Musk over advertising
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.680]   member Elon probably told Iger to GF why? Good for you. Yep.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.720]   And 10s of 1000s of Disney Plus subscribers cancel their
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.960]   subscriptions because of that. And it all makes you wonder if
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.280]   Iger now wishes he had stayed retired.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.960]   I too picked Disney. I put Disney Warner Brothers. Both of
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.560]   them had their comic book franchises collapse
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.320]   simultaneously. On the on the Warner Brothers side in the DC
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.680]   side, the flash and Justice League, everything came apart.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.200]   Streaming was too expensive. And you didn't mention these
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.000]   horrific strikes that they had to deal with. And it feels like
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.160]   they had to give a ton of concessions. So Disney was my
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.040]   biggest loser as well with Warner Brothers as their little
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.440]   brother. They are Chamath. We have a consensus. They're rare
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.400]   consensus between Saxon. I will Who did you have for your
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.360]   biggest loser in business?
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.400]   Well, you you guys partially win. Okay, because I'm gonna have
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:49.080]   to agree with you guys. But I think the biggest loser in
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:54.360]   business was the go woke community who tried to
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:59.480]   synthetically and artificially use all these social movements
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.400]   as a way to drive revenue, and just got totally burned. So
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:10.320]   Disney, bud, target. And I think the statement from consumers is
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.920]   look, just sell a product, stay in your lane. Make a better and
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.880]   better product for us at lower and lower prices. And otherwise,
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.440]   just let the politicians and the voters decide social issues. And
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.040]   I think that was pretty clear.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.520]   All right, there you have it, folks. If you're going to make
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.200]   bud light, people just want to drink the damn beer. They're not
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.960]   interested in your politics. All right, here we go. Biggest
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.520]   business surprise of 2023. Who do you got sex? Who is your
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.520]   biggest business surprise of 2023?
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:46.760]   I think it was the Fed's bank term funding program or BTF P in
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.640]   response to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.040]   regional banking crisis. As you may recall, it wasn't just SVB.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.160]   There were several dominoes in the regional banking system that
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.240]   fell. It was SVB signature First Republic, and even in Europe,
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.880]   Credit Suisse basically fell apart all because of the sudden
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.920]   spike in interest rates. A lot of people tried to blame VCs for
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.160]   this J Cal. Yeah, you and me took took some heat. The truth
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.640]   is that if the dominoes had fallen in a slightly different
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.960]   order, no one would have thought to blame VCs for this. It was
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.840]   obviously the fact that rates had spiked up. And these banks
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.480]   got caught off sides because their deposit base is volatile.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.640]   And they had loaded up on government bonds at a 1%
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.960]   interest and then the value of those bonds plummeted. The Fed
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.760]   then stepped in to prevent this from turning into a contagion.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.800]   That was where the BT FP came in. And I'm ambivalent about it
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.200]   because I think that we don't know the long term consequences
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.600]   of the Fed basically providing this liquidity to the banking
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.720]   system. However, it's very clear to me that there was a regional
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.080]   banking crisis underway and the Fed stepping in, I think
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.200]   probably saved us from having a recession this year.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.040]   Amazing. So the Fed there, I picked Facebook for my biggest
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.160]   surprise this year. They changed the name of the company two
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.360]   years ago to meta. They were pouring 10s of billions of
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.160]   dollars into VR, which nobody wanted to use. The CEO was
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.080]   focused on the wrong thing. But they turned it around the stock
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.920]   dropped to 90. And Zuckerberg, I guess didn't want to lose. And
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.240]   so he laid off 10s of 1000s of employees, said every no more
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.280]   middle managers, everybody's got to get to work. And they doubled
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.320]   down on their existing businesses. And they've made
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.760]   some great progress on AI. So my biggest business surprise was the
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.560]   resurgence of Zuckerberg and Facebook. Chamath, who did you
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.640]   have for your biggest business surprise?
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:50.040]   I'll pick Jay Powell and the Fed capitulation. I think that I've
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.840]   been saying for a while that rates will be higher for longer
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:33:00.360]   for quite a while now. And I was really surprised when Jay Powell
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.420]   had this press conference in December in early December, and
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.040]   just basically capitulated and just said, You know what, guys,
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.120]   we're going to be cutting probably three times next year.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.400]   That was effectively the gist of what he said. And immediately,
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.400]   the 10 year, basically just completely changed course. And
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:22.800]   it went from almost at 5% to below 4% within a matter of two
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.400]   and a half or three weeks. So and then the stock market has
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.040]   basically done nothing but go straight up. That's a huge
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.680]   surprise to me, because I think now what the setup is for 2024
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:39.680]   is basically we will melt up, up until the first cut, and then
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.480]   there'll probably be some real selling. And I would not have
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.520]   predicted that the markets have become a lot more accommodative.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:53.560]   As a result, I didn't expect that. So Jay Powell really, I
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.320]   think surprised a lot of us, he could have been more tempered.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.880]   But he essentially decided to give away the playbook in the
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.880]   last month of the year here.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.600]   And it's important for everybody to understand the Fed acts
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.280]   independently of the administration. It's just a
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.040]   coincidence, correct sacks, that their cuts are going to come
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.800]   just in time for fighting economics. And if it happens to
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.320]   go up in the next nine months, that has nothing to do with the
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.360]   Biden administration, who might benefit from that if the
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:20.760]   economy,
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.600]   Jason, Nick, I haven't I have a quote that I sent Nick, this is
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.640]   a this was what Larry Summers said. And I just think it's such
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:33.560]   an unbelievable quote that is just worth internalizing. If you
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.480]   just start reading here, so I prefer the Volcker Greenspan
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.920]   approach, which is to recognize that the Fed is a little bit
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.640]   like the Delphic oracles. People regarded them as omniscient and
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.040]   omnipotent, but they were in fact neither. So the oracles
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.480]   kept their pronouncements vague and oracular, not concrete and
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.600]   specific because it was impossible to be concrete and
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.040]   specific without being wrong frequently and undercut
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.040]   credibility. Sure. I mean, that is just the perfect general
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.400]   Yeah, summary of what probably should have happened in these
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.200]   pressers. And this was an example where it was the exact
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.400]   opposite and the market just took it and said, I'm off to
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:09.920]   the races
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.840]   just to agree with that and buttress it. It's not only the
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.560]   fact that they gave this guidance this year, as you
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.320]   remember, back when we started having inflation, the Fed still
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.280]   stuck to the story that it would not be raising rates for some
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.640]   extended period of time. And a lot of these banks that had
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.360]   problems, basically, because they bought too many long term
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.840]   government bonds. A lot of those bonds were bought during that
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.320]   period when the Fed was assuring him it wasn't gonna be jacking
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.040]   up rates. So if the Fed hadn't misled them, maybe they would
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.400]   have made better risk decisions. Yeah. So it works both ways.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.000]   Freeberg got a business surprise for 2023. For the audience here
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:48.920]   at the bestie awards.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:52.040]   The biggest surprise was Sam Altman's ouster and return all
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.520]   in a weekend. So that was kind of crazy. So I just give it to
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.680]   that. Nothing else to be said.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.480]   Okay, the flip flop. Love it. Okay, best science breakthrough.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.600]   This is everybody's favorite. Also, the time when sacks goes
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.480]   and takes a leak 2023. Biggest science break.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.040]   So I've got one.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.640]   I got sacks. You're awake during this. What's the biggest
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.600]   science breakthrough for you?
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:17.120]   According to NASA, there's a new look at Uranus. That's right,
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.800]   Jake out. These are never before seen deep, penetrating shots of
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.480]   Uranus. How deep and penetrating are these very deep, very
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.080]   penetrating from the James Webb Space Telescope.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:34.920]   Freeberg, when your anus gets probed this deeply, what's your
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.440]   takeaway? What's the feeling you get in this deep probing of your
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:39.920]   anus?
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.120]   Oh, wonder, mystery on wonder.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.840]   Well, that's a space colonoscopy.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.760]   Something gets moved with it.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.600]   Absolutely. I'm going to save you for last. Freeberg. Chamath,
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.040]   you have one.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.960]   Yeah, I think that this unfortunately did not get nearly
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.040]   the attention it deserves. But I'm going to pick the CRISPR FDA
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.360]   approved CRISPR treatment of sickle cell anemia. I think that
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.360]   this is just an incredibly important breakthrough. And so
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.280]   you know, sickle cell basically is just a condition where the
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.440]   shape of your red blood cells change. It causes a lot of very
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.240]   painful inflammation and damage, disproportionately affects the
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.200]   black population, African American population. And so now
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.720]   there's an approved therapy which goes in and makes the gene
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.440]   edits and fixes these folks. So congratulations to Vertex and
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.120]   CRISPR. And I think it's just incredible.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.480]   There was my big breakthrough was this brain decoder
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   technology. We didn't talk about it here on the show. But this
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.760]   project was crazy. They did MRI scans or fMRI scans of blood
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.280]   flow to different areas in the brain. They then had people
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.960]   listen to podcasts like the moth. And they tracked
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:54.200]   individuals brain activity with specific words that were said
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.560]   during the podcast, and they had them repeat words, then they
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.760]   attached it to a language model GPT one, I believe, and narrow
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.920]   down what people were thinking, then they had people think
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.800]   thoughts. And it started to use the predictive model of GPT one
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.080]   and combined it with what was happening in their brain
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.280]   chemistry. Now, this is a far way from being able to read
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.680]   people's minds. But for somebody who couldn't speak, let's say,
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.880]   the idea that you could think, and then have your thoughts and
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.120]   the story you were telling actually come out of a computer
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.240]   just by thinking would be miraculous. Obviously,
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.880]   Neuralink does this with a direct connection. But
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.960]   fascinating. Right now, sex don't think about Uranus. He's
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.600]   going deep into Uranus right now. He's reading that paper. I
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.160]   can see it in his eyes. You guys know, I got a colonoscopy.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.120]   Thank goodness. How was it? I got it on. Did they put you
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.920]   under Tuesday? Yeah, but I got I didn't get the propofol. I got
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.240]   Demerol. I think Demerol. Oh, you got to go probe. I had like
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.040]   the twilight sedation. Just kind of like, you know, it was great.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.440]   Don't get me wrong. But it was like 1520 minutes like it was
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:59.240]   not. But you were a kind of awake and lucid by halfway
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.040]   through. You woke up halfway through? Yeah. Huh? Did they
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.960]   give you a drink a little red wine or anything? Nothing? No,
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.800]   no, they didn't talk to me. No, I just saw that I saw the
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.200]   screen. I was like, what the hell? And then I just went back
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:16.080]   to sleep. Let me tell you propofol. It's drip, drip, drip.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.480]   And then you wake up four hours later. It's the most restful
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.520]   sleep you ever had. No, dude, I had 90 minutes. Maybe it's an
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.560]   hour. Yeah, yeah. I had like a 20 minute twilight sedation.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.320]   That was it. I asked him to go back up in there twice just to
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:34.440]   make sure. freeberg enough about Uranus. What was your biggest
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.400]   science surprise of 23? I know it's hard to surprise you. I
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.040]   know you guys want to hear some crazy specific thing. But I
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.800]   actually just said that there are too many breakthroughs with
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:48.720]   machine learn models of AI this year to list LLM that can run on
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.160]   small desktop machines that are open source that outperform all
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   models that were in existence even a few months prior. It
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.840]   highlights the leaps and bounds of this trajectory of
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.320]   development and models. And there's other specific examples
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.880]   like we talked about DeepMinds graphcast model, which is a
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.960]   graph neural network on the show. And obviously, all the
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.080]   generative models and imagery and movies and music, but it's
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:16.200]   just such an extraordinary time to see us leverage our combined
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.600]   capabilities to drive these surprises the pace of language
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.760]   models and the pace of AI development, just all these
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.560]   breakthroughs in aggregate. I mean, I think it's hard. It's
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.560]   hard to pay attention to anyone. There's a constellation of
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.760]   change underway. It's incredible.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:34.240]   Hmm. Okay, now it's time for our biggest flash in the pan. Who's
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:39.440]   your biggest flash in the pan? Oh, my gosh, this is a well,
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.640]   could be business, it could be society, it could be pop
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:48.800]   culture. I wrote down SBF. Okay. I think like from what looked
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.840]   like a too good to be wonder kind, frankly, just turned out
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:59.160]   to be an Adderall addicted grifter. Sacks, I hope that
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.960]   doesn't hit too close to home. Who was yours?
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:07.720]   Same ballpark. I said, effective altruism, the big hit with SBF,
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.760]   I would have thought that'd be enough to polish it off. But
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:17.280]   then we had the open AI board, oust Sam Altman, like we talked
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.320]   about, apparently that was driven by a couple of their
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.920]   nonprofit board members who were effective altruists. I think the
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.560]   failure of that whole debacle will put the nail in the coffin
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.640]   of the EA movement.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.320]   Okay, freeberg, you got a flash in the pan for 2023.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.440]   The obvious breakthrough in superconducting room temperature
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.960]   material, lk 99. Yeah, it came in, it went, everyone thought
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.360]   it was going to change the world couple weeks later, couldn't be
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.680]   replicated, was disproven, ultimately. And for a hot
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   minute there, everyone thought the world was going to change.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.200]   So super exciting to see room temperature, superconductivity
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.560]   in the search for room temperature, superconducting
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.520]   materials, get so much attention. As I mentioned, it's
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.280]   something I've thought a lot about since I was 13 years old.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.160]   So it's super cool, but didn't happen. Came in and went,
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.200]   I went with a wild card here. I said George Santos, the diva
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:13.880]   drama queen and congressman who slayed from 2023 to 2023.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.640]   Electric campaign funds to buy designer clothes and get Botox.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:27.760]   So he asked Queen and Sephora and Sephora. Queen just making
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.640]   bank over a cameo. I'm gonna have him come in. He's gonna do
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.040]   a he's gonna do a quick cameo here on all in pockets. All
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:40.680]   right. Best CEO, your best CEO, best CEO. I'll go first. I'll go
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.640]   first. I haven't got first yet. I picked a wild card here. I
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.800]   went Taylor Swift $4 billion in revenue from the tour and the
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.760]   merchandise and the movie and everything. Each tour stop
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.520]   generates $90 million for the city she lands in. She's getting
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.400]   85% she went direct to movie theaters with that concert movie
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.840]   and made a quarter billion dollars. She's hands down. Best
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.000]   CEO of 2023. For me, we got Sathya Nadella, CEO of
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.880]   Microsoft. I just think the gross tonnage of market cap
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.040]   dollars he added in 2023 plus figuring out how to close
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.960]   Activision, plus retaining maximum optionality with open AI
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:29.560]   is just the masterclass in heads down management.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.120]   Well done, Saks. Who do you got?
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:38.600]   I have Jensen Wang, CEO of Nvidia and king of the GPU. We
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.840]   talked about the magnificent seven, but none was more
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:46.120]   magnificent than Nvidia whose stock is up 235%. And earnings
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.240]   and forecasts keep blowing doors off. Jensen has been planning
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.320]   this moment for many years before the whole AI frenzy took
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.680]   hold. And Nvidia is now reaping the benefit of that.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.800]   Who do you got? Friedberg?
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.360]   I give it to Sam Altman, because I don't think any individual has
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.600]   generated more attention on a private company and its effect
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:11.160]   on the world and the future than Sam Altman and open AI. And I
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.640]   think that he's been aggressive in raising capital, this guy can
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.480]   raise like he can raise. And then he over bets on people, he
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.480]   finds talent, he gives them extraordinary comp packages,
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.200]   gets them to come and work on this, this extraordinary effort
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.120]   and then gets them to deliver results. He pushes the limits,
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.120]   he pushes the boundaries, even beyond what's comfortable for
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.760]   his board members. Clearly, you know, the comes with the good
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.520]   and the bad. And then even after he got ousted by his board, his
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.840]   entire employee base through a crew and got him back. And sure,
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.520]   everyone's got their economic motivations to see that happen.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.920]   But I still think that the setup was, you know, largely his, his
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.760]   work. So he does deserve credit for that. So all in, I think
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.960]   it's, it's an incredible year for Sam Altman.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:57.720]   Now we move on to 2023. Best Investor Chamath, who was your
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.960]   best investor for 2023? Here at the bestie awards.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:05.120]   It was a continuation of the last couple of years. But it's
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.520]   the pot shops and specifically Citadel. So I give that award to
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.720]   Ken Griffin. You know, pot shops, I think have really
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:15.920]   become the hallway bully of the public capital markets and
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:22.200]   Citadel is the kingpin. They returned $7 billion to their
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.640]   investors in 23. I think if you go back, since 2020, they've
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.920]   returned more than 20 billion, they generated, you know, 15%
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.000]   very steady returns uncorrelated to the market. It's just a
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.120]   machine. I mean, it's incredible. It's an incredible
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.200]   business that he's built. So he is. There's nobody close.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.120]   saxody. I've got
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.960]   Bill Ackman here for timing the bond market perfectly. He
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.680]   shorted bonds for most of the year making hundreds of millions
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:54.000]   of dollars. And then on October 23, he announced that he was
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.880]   covering his positions and that it was too risky to stay short
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.600]   in bonds and he was going long. And that very day was the high
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.880]   point of the 10 year bond yield. The market made a bottom on
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.840]   October 27. Since then yields have plummeted, which means that
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:11.160]   the value bonds is sort. And the best part of it is that Ackman
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.640]   is using his new FU money to take on Ivy League University
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.960]   presidents for their woke DEI double standards, grifting and
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.720]   plagiarism.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.840]   Well done. All right, free Berkeley. I also said Ackman for
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.720]   his timing on the Treasury trade.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.360]   I was right there with you guys, except I wanted to go with the
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.960]   wildcard. I am astounded by the growth of tick tock. And I just
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:35.280]   worked backwards. Arthur Danchik, who I've never met from
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.160]   Susquehanna International Group referred to as SIG in the
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.640]   industry still owns according to sources, 15% of this company,
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.760]   which could be worth three, four or $500 billion when it goes
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:51.600]   out. And despite all the saber rattling, the CCP has not
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.400]   divested from it, even though Trump and Biden both said they
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.840]   were going to try to do that. And ByteDance was caught spying
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.720]   on American journalists using their tick tock data. So the
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.960]   fact that that investment is still in place to me is
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.200]   extraordinary. So congratulations to them. But let's
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.600]   sell it quick. All right, now we move on moving quickly here.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.360]   2023. Best turnaround, which are best turnaround, Jamal.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.720]   This was like three years in the making, but I'll give it to
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:20.320]   Novo Nordisk. I think the amount of attention that Novo has
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.680]   gotten for a Zempick, what Govi and rebels in 2023 was
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:29.000]   incredible. But you have to go back to the last decade where
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.840]   the first five years there was just not much activity, and they
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:38.080]   had to maintain their investment, stay strong, stay
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.880]   focused. And then starting in about 2019. The stock has been
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.560]   about a four or five x in the last four or five years. And I
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.400]   think these semi glutide GLP ones are here to stay. They're
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:55.440]   transformational on society. So that was an enormous task of
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.640]   corporate focus. So I'll give the turnaround award to Novo
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.080]   Nordisk,
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.560]   sacks, we got in light of what's happening right now in the
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:10.280]   crypto markets, I'm gonna go with Solana. Oh, wow. Wow. I
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.520]   began the year at about $9 a token. It's now at 92. As of
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.840]   this moment, obviously, it's very volatile, but it's up
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.920]   roughly 10x this year to date. And in light of the fact that
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.600]   various unscrupulous actors on the internet accused some of us
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:30.600]   of buying Solana at a discount and dumping it on retail without
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.440]   any evidence, and that wasn't true. Let's just say that those
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.760]   of us who are still holding bags of Solana are very happy
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.560]   campers right now.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.840]   Freeberg, who do you got biggest business turnaround?
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:51.200]   I give it to Dara and Uber when he took over that business. I
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.520]   think it was an eight to $9 billion net loss in 2019 $5
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.400]   billion EBITDA run rate right now incredible forecasting
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.000]   incredible skill and forecasting the sensitivities in that
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.760]   business, by the way,
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.120]   say more, say more.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.600]   And, you know, obviously, he's seen the market cap just this
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:12.080]   year grow from 50 billion to 126 billion as of today. So give it
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.400]   to Dara for the big turnaround product sucks, though, I will
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.280]   say it's gotten expensive card to get an Uber sit around and
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.960]   wait forever. So Dara, please fix that. Otherwise, good job.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:27.200]   Well done. I went with a one that you guys gave awards to and
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.560]   on all the previous awards, Sam Waltman is all over this year as
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:35.840]   besties. I thought going from being fired for malfeasance to
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.400]   becoming a martyr and then I'm the captain now you can throw in
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:43.040]   the I'm the captain now meme right here, Nick, for the pod in
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.840]   about 10 days, he captured three full news cycles was named CEO
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:50.800]   of the Year, and the palace intrigue raising money for an
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.520]   Nvidia killer in the Middle East. I mean, this guy is like
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:59.520]   James Bond plus a CEO. So what a great turnaround from fired to
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.200]   desired Sam Altman. All right, let's go to our next one here.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:08.600]   2023 the worst company of the year. This is the company that
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:13.640]   is loathsome and horrible. In our opinions. And it's that's
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:17.200]   all it is, folks. It's just for dudes opinions, sacks. In your
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   opinion, what was the worst company of 2023?
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.600]   I'm gonna go with Pfizer. Just last week, the Wall Street
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.520]   Journal had an expose on the inner turmoil at Pfizer as its
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:32.520]   market cap has lost $140 billion in valuation in 2023. By the
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.120]   way, that headline is ridiculous. Pfizer did not save
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:43.000]   the world. The reason why they are off so much is because of a
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   massive drop in demand for Pax Lovett and for COVID boosters.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.920]   Apparently, people do not see the value in those products.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:57.120]   They finally figured it out. I would say that the company is
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.280]   also suffering from a credibility crisis. By not
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.200]   leveling with the public about the efficacy and safety of their
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.280]   vaccines. The CEO Albert burla was confronted in Davos by
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.200]   citizen journalists for this lack of transparency back in
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.320]   January of this year. And what's interesting is that if you read
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.160]   the Wall Street Journal piece, even his own employees are
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.680]   questioning burla's candor. When he announced on a company wide
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.200]   virtual town hall that the company was embarking on a cost
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:28.360]   cutting effort. The chat room erupted in snark, quote, future
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.880]   is bright, but you might get fired is how one employee
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.560]   characterized burla spin. This led another employee to reply
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.520]   quote, dumpster fires are always bright.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.560]   All right, Friedberg worst company of 2023. For you. You
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.920]   have a worst company must listen.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.280]   I do. I'm going to get through this without getting interrupted.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.880]   The worst company of 2023 is movie on foodstuff. This company
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.840]   is pure evil. It's got 137,000 employees. It's based in China.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:59.520]   It's the world's largest slaughter of pigs slaughters 2.1
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.960]   million pigs per year, with the world's largest pig farm near
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.040]   Nanyang, where they basically take pigs from birth and breed
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.000]   them all the way through to slaughter. During their entire
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.760]   lives. These pigs never get to move more than a few inches.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   They live in these multi storey housing units that they never
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.160]   get to see sun or the light from the outside. Through their whole
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.120]   lives. They're kept separate from their families. Pigs are as
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.520]   smart as most dogs and even young children. And at the end
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.840]   of their very painful, awful existence as they're slaughtered
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.520]   and fed to a growing population. China consumes over a billion
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.920]   pigs a year. It's a horrific situation. So
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:42.760]   that's the most loathsome company of 2023.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.520]   Sounds delicious.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:49.000]   Dude,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.160]   you you you went off camera.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:58.040]   You started laughing. It's nice. Are you laughing? That's why I
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.240]   started laughing. I mean, I had 15 jokes, but I'm not gonna make
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.120]   any of them. Yeah, when none of us are for factory farming. It's
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:08.480]   horrible. Who is your worst company? Come on, come on, get
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.680]   in the game here. Who is your worst company?
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.760]   It's a tie between FTX and Silicon Valley Bank. One stole
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:20.520]   customer accounts and the other one just was run by a CEO and a
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:23.320]   risk management infrastructure that really imperiled and almost
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.560]   imperiled an entire industry.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.120]   There you go.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.440]   For me, it was Fox News. They deceived their loyal customers
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:32.480]   by knowingly spreading fake news about voting machines. I wound
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.040]   up firing their most loved host in our fifth bestie, Tucker
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:40.160]   Carlson, and they paid record setting fines for misleading the
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.720]   public and creating massive division in our country. And
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.800]   they're facing an even bigger lawsuit, a $2.7 billion lawsuit
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.040]   with another election technology company that will happen in
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:56.600]   2025. Pension funds are now suing this loathsome company
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:01.240]   because they lost so much money for them. So my worst company of
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:08.640]   the year is Fox News. All right, Sacha, I'm sorry. So you go for
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.200]   the microphone there.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.440]   I'm not gonna defend Fox after they fire Tucker.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.040]   Exactly, exactly. That's why I put in there for you.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.720]   I do think the judgments or the magnitude of the judgments are
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.480]   ridiculous.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.680]   Okay, now it's time. We have a little bit of fun here.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:27.040]   Best meme, your best meme. Fun stuff. I'll start it off this
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:30.800]   year. I love the Boston cop on a slide. I don't know if you guys
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.760]   have seen this one, but it went super viral. They've made
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.720]   millions of versions of it. This is the cop in Boston, going down
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.160]   a slide.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:46.840]   And the backstory here, bunch of cops were told there's a slide
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:50.120]   that's too dangerous in Boston. One of them tried to do their
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.880]   duty and confirm that it was in fact dangerous. And he got
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.280]   injured coming down the slide. And now anytime something is
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:00.760]   going off the track, whether it's a market or a company, you
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:06.120]   play that clip. Sachs, you're a master of memes. What do you got
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.600]   for us this year in the 2023 Bestial Awards?
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.520]   Well, I think the meme of the year had to be the GFY. Elon's
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:17.440]   answer to Bob Iger's attempt to blackmail him. But we need to
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.040]   see this in the gift version, the way the hand motions are,
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:25.400]   it's this, then this, and then it comes back in. Good for
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.360]   conductor of an orchestra.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:31.160]   Just a standard good for you. Jamal, did you have a, did you
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.680]   have a favorite Jamal a favorite meme of 2023? Yeah, Nick, if
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:39.560]   you want to just throw it up there. I'm a journalist, and
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.840]   it's the kid.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:48.360]   Journalism. What is this talking about? I think it's, it's what
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.680]   we all know. And I think it was further exposed this year, just
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:56.520]   the brazen, naked ambition and corrupt nature of the mainstream
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.080]   media. Jason, you said it really well. And I, and it really made
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.240]   an impact on me. So I want to give you credit. We are all
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.560]   citizen journalists, investigative journalists now.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.720]   And I think that that's true. I think we all have a
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:14.960]   responsibility to pick the information source. And to that,
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:19.200]   yeah, they never been more true than this. You got to have
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.520]   multiple sources triangulate the truth for yourself. But yeah, I
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.800]   wouldn't trust the mainstream media. At this point, you know,
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:29.720]   as but one of many sources, freeberg, get a favorite meme.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:33.280]   Got a favorite meme. No, I didn't put anything on this.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.560]   Okay, you gave us six minutes on pigs being killed, but you can't
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:41.560]   come up with one mean, okay. With a meme. Come on, man. I
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:45.160]   think it's kind of funny. Actually, he has no, he was
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:45.680]   meaningless.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:49.440]   We need to play that way of music.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:55.880]   Best new tech, best new tech, we got to keep things moving. Last
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:59.680]   year was a fusion in GPT across the board. This year, I'll just
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.680]   get a mine out of the way real quick. I'm going to go with
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.680]   something more specific chat GPT app has been extraordinary. It
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.320]   now has 4.0. And it has Dolly in it. I've been making incredible
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.920]   images to go with my my sub stack and my blog posts that I
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.440]   would have paid 1000s of dollars, you know, for each one
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:19.440]   of those when I was doing magazines, and they have voice
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:23.320]   chat. If you haven't connected chat GPT, his voice app to the
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:26.760]   new action button on the iPhone 15. There's a button above your
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:30.480]   volume called action, you can map it to a specific feature
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.520]   inside of any app. I mapped it to voice chat on chat GPT. When
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.120]   I'm driving with my kids, they have a question, we put it in.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.040]   And we just started asking questions about history,
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:43.440]   science, whatever it happens to be pop culture, music, to chat
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:47.360]   GPT for and it is an extraordinary breakthrough app.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:51.400]   And it's, you know, been downloaded, I think hundreds of
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.040]   millions of times now or over 100 million. Incredible,
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:56.840]   incredible progress there. Chamath, you had a best tech.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:01.320]   Best new tech, I don't think there was anything meaningful in
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:05.160]   2023. I think there was a lot of improvements to things that were
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:09.880]   founded and started in 2020, or 2021 or 2022. Nothing new that
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.640]   company this year,
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:15.840]   sacks. I have starling for JetSuite x, I of course, I've
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:17.280]   never used it, but I heard it's great.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:22.880]   If you do fly with other humans who you don't know,
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.160]   I'm looking forward to starling for private aviation as well.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:30.840]   But I've heard it's a real game changer on commercial flights,
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.000]   and every kind of flight,
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.200]   Friberg, best new tech.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:41.280]   My best new tech of this year, I think is really important. As
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:46.360]   we race to keep the promise of AI alive in the face of
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.800]   increasing government regulation, which is open
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:54.640]   source locally run LLM. So you can take an LLM and you can run
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.640]   it on your machine, you don't have to be connected to the
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.120]   internet, you don't have to have a third party service provider
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:03.520]   making an LLM available to you. And so this allows the
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:08.440]   continued development and pursuit of productivity gains
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.320]   and new capabilities that emerge from these LLMs by making them
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:17.000]   local offline, disconnected from the internet and, and away from
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.200]   the scrutability of agencies that want to check your model
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:22.920]   and make sure it's okay. So this is really important to me, I do
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.160]   think like my broader trend right now is I think that
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:29.880]   there's this really scary, big shift of, you're either going to
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.360]   end up in a new enlightenment, or you're gonna end up in a new
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.560]   dark ages. And I think we're seeing this play out and all
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.840]   these conflicts around the world, and all of this
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.600]   regulation and all of the technology that's being deemed
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:44.600]   either a threat or an opportunity. And so I think any
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.320]   technology capability that allows us to pursue the
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:50.600]   enlightenment is a winner for me. So anyway, this was a big
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.640]   shift that happened this year. And there's multiple models that
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.200]   are publicly available that are free open source that you can
[00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:01.160]   run. Okay, 2023. Best trend. What was the best trend? 2023?
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:06.160]   For you? I actually didn't really couldn't figure one out.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.760]   Okay, Saks, you got a best trend for 2023. Something that
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.480]   happened often it became a trend.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:16.480]   My best friend is the return of colorblindness as the standard
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.800]   and the pushback on dEI. We already talked about the
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.560]   university presidents and what Bill Ackman is doing. I would
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.760]   add to that that the Supreme Court banned race based
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.120]   affirmative action and university admissions in June.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.520]   And red state governors like Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.520]   took that as a green light to shut down dEI programs in their
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.800]   public colleges and universities. I think that this
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.520]   is a good trend and hopefully it continues next year because
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.680]   America should be a colorblind meritocracy.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.000]   Friedberg, what was your best trend of 2023?
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.440]   The profitability focus at young companies, particularly in an
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.520]   age of AI co pilot tools for software development. From what
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.480]   I've seen, it's pretty incredible in single person.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:04.160]   efforts can yield what historically is required 612 or
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.840]   more people to do using co pilot tools and AI. So software
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.840]   development is accelerated new products and entire companies
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.920]   can be built by single individual at very low cost,
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.160]   building totally customized software. So from what I've seen,
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.000]   it's not widely adopted. These these capabilities as you guys
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.080]   probably have seen, as well, it's starting to be. But just
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.640]   imagine once the majority of people are using these co
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.960]   piloting tools to write software, and start to learn how
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.040]   to use these tools, it's really going to increase productivity
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.920]   globally, as it finds its way into every business, and
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.960]   everyone can become an entrepreneur and so on. So it's
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.160]   good. It's incredible to see.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.920]   I to sax was looking at the issue of dEI and I framed mine
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.680]   as dEI dying and meritocracy thriving. That was the best
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.720]   trend for me. So we are once again, simpatico you and I dEI
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.280]   dying meritocracy thriving, nicely done.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.000]   You really are proving you're a centrist.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.240]   Yeah, I mean, I think, or I just listened to MLK speech. And I
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.680]   thought that seems like the most logical thing to do. You're
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.040]   right. 100%. We figured this out some time ago.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.960]   Yeah, I don't know why we have to rehash it. Okay. 2023. Worst
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.960]   trend. I'll lead it off. I had three here of worst trends.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.360]   Number one, anti semitism, absolutely disgusting and
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.160]   horrible to Trump's rehabilitation. We'll just leave
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.600]   it at that. And then three people have low moral character
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.800]   using the freedom of speech movement to whitewash their
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.360]   horrible personal behavior. Yes, I'm talking about Alex Jones to
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.200]   all the mids in the comments. sacks. What was the worst trend
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:36.560]   for you?
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.000]   You had to have three, didn't you?
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.600]   Well, I'm going to go with anti semitism. Those are my two
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.440]   runners. Two runners.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.800]   All right, fair enough. Yeah, I think you guys are like my worst
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.200]   trend. It is the metastasizing national debt. This chart
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.520]   really makes it clear you can see here the national debt as a
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:57.320]   function of deficit and revenues and it's a upside down hockey
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.160]   stick. Jesus. If a company could produce user growth that looked
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.560]   like this, I would invest all day long. However, this is not
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.880]   growth. This is basically how much we owe. And it is a
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.480]   bipartisan problem. It's been going on for really 20 plus
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:17.400]   years. But it is getting worse and worse under Biden. Yeah.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.200]   8 trillion added to the deficit under Trump and looks like five
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.280]   to 6 trillion under Biden.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.560]   Well, you know, we did have a COVID. We did have meltdown
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:31.000]   where the economy was down 30% year over year. So the tax
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.440]   taxing COVID. Yeah, both parties supported that bailout. And in
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.960]   hindsight, it was excessive. Yeah. Biden's quote unquote
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.200]   stimulus was passed on straight party lines after COVID was
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.160]   ready over. Yeah. So I think we should just make sure to
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.440]   apportion the blame correctly. But like I said, bipartisan
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:47.880]   problem.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:52.000]   Yeah, I agree. bipartisan and Trump did a very ill timed tax
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.320]   cut before COVID. So it's a double hit. If you want to
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:00.200]   compare it in eight years. Obama added 8 trillion. So it was 1
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.920]   trillion a year. These new guys getting close to 2 trillion per
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.560]   year. So they doubled the velocity of spending. Just
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.640]   completely disastrous. Jamal. What's the worst trend for you?
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.200]   I just think it's the the general state of affairs.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.120]   Amongst our young people are 20 year olds and our 30 year olds,
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.840]   I think are really struggling. And it's gotten worse. I'll give
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:31.080]   you two examples. Here. You see on your screen. This year, 158,000
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.240]   more Americans died than expected, which is more than all
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.320]   the wars combined in Vietnam. And when you look at where those
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:41.280]   death rates are, those death rates were coming from 35 to 44
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.280]   year olds, which was up 26%, and 25 to 34 year olds, which was up
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:50.680]   20% above pre COVID levels. And all we can point to from the
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.920]   government establishment is that it's smoking and a bad diet,
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.800]   which doesn't really hang together. And then the second
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.400]   trend is when you look at just general marriage rates amongst
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.240]   these same cohort of people, it's meaningfully worse than
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:09.880]   every cohort above it. So just societally, these folks are not
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.560]   tracking in whatever dimension you want to measure sort of like
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.080]   happiness, fulfillment, stability, safety, something is
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.160]   meaningfully wrong in these cohorts of people, and we owe it
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.120]   to them to figure it out.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.720]   The one thing you missed there, right, you're not in the Western
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.360]   world, at least 36% increase in suicide over the past two
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.560]   decades. So a lot. It's another one. So that might be the main
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.200]   one. I think in this is the mental health issues are acute.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.640]   Okay, we have free bear your left for the worst trend, the
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.080]   bestie award for worst trend of 2023. What do you got?
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.120]   I don't know, I had one, I'm going to change it on the fly.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.720]   Oh, I'm going to go with the normalization of spending. I
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.920]   think it's probably the worst trend. Like it's, you know, it
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.840]   used to be a big deal. Remember when the TARP program happened
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.400]   in a way, and it was an incredible, single line item of
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:01.680]   $800 billion to support the troubled asset relief effort to
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.560]   try and keep the economy stable by buying up all of this failing
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.840]   debt and supporting all of these equities and keeping these
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:14.280]   businesses going. And now it's like $100 billion for his
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.680]   trillion for that. It's like we've normalized spending and
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.480]   COVID just made it worse. So to your guys's point earlier about
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.800]   the acceleration of spending. Once you spend $1, you think
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.360]   it's okay to spend $1. And then next time you spend two, it's
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.520]   not that bad. It's only $1 more. And the next time you spend
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.280]   five, it's only three bucks more. And suddenly, it becomes
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.080]   normal. And this normalization catches up to us. I've harped
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.040]   on this enough, so I won't go into it too much. But I think
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.560]   that's the worst. Who did you change from? What was your what
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.080]   was your original? My original was the merging of the
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:47.600]   oppressor oppressed ideologies that are in diametric opposition
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.360]   to each other. I just found this more ironic than the worst
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:56.240]   trend, I think, which is like LGBTQ groups that were pro
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:00.240]   Hamas that were marching and supporting Hamas, which is
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:04.680]   anti LGBTQ. It was just so mind blowing to me to see some of the
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.880]   behavior over the last couple of months that made absolutely no
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.880]   sense. And it shows how little first principles thinking people
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.640]   are actually doing about the things that they're standing up
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:21.520]   for. Standing up for a free Palestine is one kind of point.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.920]   But being pro Hamas, when Hamas would have a responsibility of
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.520]   eradicating people like you, it's just it's just nuts to me.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.080]   So there's just some of the stuff that I've seen, where the
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.680]   oppressor oppressed ideology is trained to fit everything, even
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.920]   if it makes absolutely no sense. Yes, it's just really
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.720]   frustrating to see.
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:47.040]   Okay, now we go on to a little casual, the bestie awards for
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:51.440]   2023. Favorite media, favorite media, new things that came out
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.720]   in the media could be a video game, book, music, or a TV show.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.480]   I'll lead us off here, just get it out of the way real quick. For
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.960]   me, the secession finale, extraordinary, one of the best
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:06.320]   pieces of television ever made. And my sleeper was the bear
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.960]   season two, very niche show on FX, I think I turned a lot of
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:14.560]   you on to it. And season two had an episode episode five, which
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.680]   is the forks episode in which Kami sends Richie to intern at a
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.320]   very elite restaurant, and he's charged with polishing
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.400]   silverware. And Garrett and him get into it. Why am I doing all
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.040]   this stupid stuff? And he just tells them listen, every day
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.520]   here is a freaking Super Bowl. And it's just a great, great,
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.440]   amazing episode of television with extraordinary performances
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.160]   and writing Chamath. Did you have any favorite media this
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.760]   year? Anything that Taylor Swift did this year was Whitehall,
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:49.800]   you're a Swifty. She is a tour de force. She's incredible. And
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.960]   she's a genius. What can you say? Nothing sucks.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.080]   I'm going to use my spot to draw attention to some podcasts that
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:02.960]   you may not have heard of. Some geopolitics and world affairs
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:08.200]   podcast. So that probably my number one is the Duran. With
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.400]   Alexander victorious and Alex Christophero. I'd also give
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.240]   honorable mention to judge Napolitano's podcast and Colonel
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:20.000]   Daniel Davis. I have found these three podcasts to be quite
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.800]   useful in understanding what's happening in the rest of the
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.720]   world. And I found their reporting and analysis be more
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.760]   accurate than anything you're going to get in the mainstream
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.320]   media free break any favorite media for you as we get close to
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:35.640]   wrapping here. I recently read a book that I liked. I don't know
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.160]   if I talked about it called the idea factory on the history of
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.280]   Bell Labs and the great age of American innovation strongly
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:46.840]   recommended I had no idea how much this Bell Labs institution
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.960]   touched modern life, from radar to the transistor, to the
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:56.640]   nuclear bomb to computing. Even information theory was developed
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.440]   inside of Bell Labs. It was an incredible organization that
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.360]   took its roots in an institutionalized monopoly, which
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.040]   then enabled them to have one customer that was always a built
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.000]   in customer but gave them the freedom and the resourcing to
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.160]   build all of these great things. And for anyone that wants to say
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.920]   that monopolies stifle innovation, I encourage you to
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.480]   read this book because it really says the opposite may be true,
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.160]   that a monopoly enables investment in long term thinking
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.320]   and long term ideas that you never otherwise see. So I give
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:29.240]   it to that. I also had a softer one. Have you guys ever watched
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.400]   Bobby Alcoff's podcast? I found this so funny this year. You
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.240]   guys ever seen it? Her interview with Drake is hilarious. It's so
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.240]   funny. So she interviewed Drake. She's interviewed Cuban. Oh,
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.840]   yeah, I know you're talking about the deadpan. Yeah, the
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.200]   deadpan. So she's got this like, wholly disinterested persona.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:49.840]   And it totally encapsulates like a Gen Z, like personality in a
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.280]   way that you don't get in any other media. It's really, and
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.000]   she's hilarious when she does these interviews. And she's very
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.240]   unique, like Andy Kaufman, or Jim Carrey, like in that sense,
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.040]   like unique and how she does this. I just think like, we'll
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.720]   see if the stick lasts, like she may end up kind of being tired
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   soon and see if she has a second act. The Drake interview was
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.080]   really good. The one with Cuban had two problems with it. One,
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.880]   they sat on the ground and then two Cubans feet were really
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.320]   dirty. Did you see the one with Shaq? And so I was like, bro,
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.360]   like, yeah, just keep the shoes on. And just you know, Shaq one
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.960]   was hilarious. But anyway, she's, she's got great contents.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.920]   It's it's hit or miss. By the way, I'll also say it's not
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.600]   consistent, hit or miss. But I don't know, I just found her to
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.240]   be a little bit of a unique standout in in content this
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.920]   year. Everyone's kind of me to me to look the same. She stood
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.560]   out a bit for me.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:41.320]   In that vein, have you seen Z way? Zi we know she is a woman
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.560]   who interviews people and then she asks people very
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.600]   uncomfortable questions about race. Like how many black
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.200]   friends you have named them. And it is hilarious. It is like the
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.720]   greatest bit ever. Z shout out to Z way Z way since we went
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.680]   there on who's seen it you saw tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:03.200]   you're on Tick Tock, you'll see it because she just had like,
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:07.360]   yeah, she just has anybody in pop culture. George Santos on
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:14.480]   shit. Yeah. Wow. And it was just so incredible. Crazy. On the
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.600]   podcasting front. Shout out to our friend Gwyneth Paltrow. If
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.280]   you don't listen to the goo podcast, she does like
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.240]   interviews every other time. Really good. Red scare. Another
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.400]   great alternative podcast I like to listen to from the dirtbag
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:32.800]   left as they call it and shout out preparers cafe insider
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.800]   cafe.com. All right. I think is this the end producer Nick? Are
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.640]   we here? Did we make it last one? Last one. We have a special
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:46.040]   award here. The self immolation award. This has been named after
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:50.720]   Rudy Giuliani. So Rudy Giuliani self immolation award. And this
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:58.200]   is a tough one to give this year sacks because it's gonna be
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.600]   quite self referential here. Go. I am going to name Liz McGill,
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.520]   the now former president of the University of Pennsylvania. So
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.440]   well had been vomiting on herself for two months. In the
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.760]   aftermath of October 7, before she even appeared at that
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.280]   congressional hearing with the presence of Harvard MIT. She
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:20.900]   answered what was clearly a moral question with a tone deaf
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.840]   legalistic answer, saying that advocacy of genocide against
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.560]   Jews depends on context falls into question whether one is
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.800]   smart enough to be university president. It's not a job that
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.520]   demands that much intelligence, but it does require an instinct
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.120]   for knowing when and how to cover your own ass. When she was
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.720]   finally forced to step down. It felt like a mercy killing. Yeah.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.960]   Was she the one smirking to? Yeah, she had the awkward. I
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.520]   found the most appalling was the awkward smirks. Yep. Chamath who
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:54.080]   lit themselves on fire. Most of all this year who poured
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.800]   gasoline over their heads and just lit up a stogie.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.480]   I think it's the brand and reputation of the Ivies. I think
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.320]   that there was irreparable harm done. Yes, we've had
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.920]   generations now that have been taught that that is where we
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:12.160]   send our best and brightest kids. But it turns out that
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.720]   they're getting indoctrinated into some very kind of extreme
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.960]   rhetoric that then produces these incapable first
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.080]   principles thinkers, that will be the destruction of our
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.240]   society if we don't fix it. So I think Harvard applications were
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:34.080]   down 17% already. I expect that trend across the Ivies to go
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:40.400]   way up. I expect contributions to go down. I expect
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.040]   governments to ratchet down their spending in those schools.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.240]   And I expect some folks to try to take away their nonprofit
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:53.920]   status. So I think that we are going to reallocate the brand
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:15:00.160]   equity of the Ivies to good schools. And we will know what
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.880]   the good schools are based on their independence, their
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.880]   ability to churn out first principles thinkers and their
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:12.960]   respect for freedom of speech without being moral idiots.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.400]   Friedberg, what do you got? Well, well, Sanchima Ivy League
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.240]   presidents. Okay, well done. No, no need to add too much more
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.440]   there, I guess. You know, I was torn here between the namesake
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:30.360]   of this very award. If you missed it, Rudy Giuliani had $150
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.360]   million judgment against him maybe two weeks ago for
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.160]   slandering to poor, innocent people in his electoral scam
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.680]   that he ran with Trump. And he, I think is going to get indicted
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.600]   next year for these fake electorates. So follow the fake
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.000]   electorates one, but that was a close one for me, because Kanye
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.080]   West also lit himself on fire in the past year with the Adidas
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:54.080]   contract and his anti semitism getting kicked off Twitter x.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.320]   But I feel like that was mental illness. And I think Rudy
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.520]   Giuliani is just stupid. So I give it to Rudy Giuliani, the
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.920]   namesake of this award.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.600]   And the only thing I'll say about that J Cal is, I'm not
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:13.360]   going to defend him or his actions at all. I do think I do
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.880]   think that judgment was excessive. And it's part of a
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:20.640]   pattern of ridiculous judgments that we see when you have, for
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.160]   example, a DC jury pool, judging a conservative or a Republican
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.240]   whose politics they disagree with. The plaintiffs only asked
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:33.440]   for $48 million, the jury awarded three times that it's an
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:36.680]   excessive award, I think a few million dollars as a penalty
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.120]   would have been a perfectly nice award, I think to bankrupt the
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.080]   man, which is what you're talking about is becoming a bit
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.160]   of a pylon. And I'm all in favor of Rudy being the butt of jokes
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.480]   until the point where really, you're talking about destroying
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.600]   his life. I think it's gone way too far.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.160]   Yeah, these are words are curious at how large they are,
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.560]   they all get appealed, though, and they all come down. So I'm
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.240]   sure that'll come down by some massive percentage in the near
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.280]   future. This has been the year end episode. Can you believe it?
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.000]   We made it another year, guys. Here we are at the end of 2023.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.840]   We'll do our predictions next week. So you'll get our amazing
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:16.640]   predictions for 2024. In the next episode. Any closing
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.920]   thoughts on the year we just had? Freeberg? How you feeling
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.680]   here at the end of the year? Are you hopeful? Are you cheery? Are
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.960]   you sad? Are you excited?
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:29.640]   I've been up since 5am and I just drank beers. So I'm pretty
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   tired. But with respect, that's kind of how the whole year feels
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:38.160]   actually feel like I exhausted. Yeah, I just got up early, crank
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:42.440]   through the day had some beer and I'm ready for a nap. But I'm
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:47.120]   I'm probably more optimistic going into 2024 than I was going
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.480]   into 2023. Because that's on a personal basis. And I think,
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.040]   yeah, there's just a lot going on today in the world. Yeah,
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:58.040]   it's complex, isn't it? I do think as long as we embrace the
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.840]   Enlightenment and don't embrace the Dark Ages, we stand a shot
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.200]   at keeping progress alive. And I think that's the defining
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.840]   characteristics of human civilization is progress. And
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:13.200]   that's, I think, ultimately resolves all the conflicts and
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.880]   other things. We just got to keep it alive.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.760]   Well said. Chamath, how are you feeling here as we wrap up 2023
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.200]   and looking into 2024?
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:25.880]   I think 2022 and 2023 have been looking back the most important
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:30.440]   two years of my professional career. I think I benefited like
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.720]   we all I think I think all four of us could say this, have just
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:38.600]   an incredible set of tailwinds. And 22 and 23 for the first time
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.760]   where I was in a position of influence and capital and power
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:46.040]   where I had to confront that those tailwinds can quickly
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:51.800]   become headwinds and that we are not impervious to them. So I
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.280]   like Friedberg I'm looking forward to 24 where I can try to
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.040]   put all these learnings to good use. So it's been generally
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.840]   good. And 23 was the most important year of my life in the
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.560]   sense that I got remarried. So that's been a huge personal
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.880]   highlight. Yes, beautiful. Love that you guys all came to that
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:10.640]   as well as a highlight for us to absolutely beautiful. Yeah, I'm
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.280]   ready to I'm ready to turn the page on this year and start 24.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.240]   sacks any closing thoughts here?
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:20.080]   Well, I think one of the biggest surprises of 2023 is that we
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.800]   didn't have a recession. I mean, I think most people were betting
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.400]   on a recession in 23. They thought that a soft landing
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.280]   would be almost impossible. And in fact, the data is that soft
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.880]   landings almost never occur. Remember what Larry Summers said
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.480]   to us at our all in summit this year, which is soft landings are
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.520]   like second marriages. It's the triumph of hope over experience,
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.520]   meaning they almost never happen. And so the fact that we
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:48.120]   didn't get that I think that was basically a pretty important
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.200]   bullet dodge. Now that being said, I do think that the whole
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.320]   b2b software industry definitely went through a recession. But
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.800]   fortunately, I think we bottomed out and starting to see green
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.160]   shoots now. So things are returning to normal. On the
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:06.280]   global stage. Things are still okay, in the sense that the US
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.920]   is not directly in a war, but man, it is pretty scary. We could
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.120]   be pulled into a dynamic, very dynamic, we pulled into a war in
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.640]   the Middle East anytime we still have a proxy war going in
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.640]   Ukraine. So there are a lot of risks still on the horizon, I'll
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.640]   just say for the gentleman and for the audience, it has been
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.720]   wonderful to have all of you, the audience, the fans of the
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.560]   show, and you besties in my life, over two really tough
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:35.040]   years, it was also very proud of myself going into them. I knew I
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.840]   was built for and it was a war the last few years, it was
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.360]   difficult, it was hard. But we all I think learned a lot and
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.360]   came out stronger because of it. And I just want to give a
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.520]   particular shout out to all of you guys for making this brand
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.200]   extraordinary and taking it to new heights. Almost all the
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:55.680]   times I've built things, brands, and gadget, Silicon
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.040]   Iron Porter, all in whatever it is, it was a solo effort. And
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.800]   it's just been really rewarding to be part of a team. And I want
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.920]   to just give a particular note to freeburg, who I think all of
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:08.740]   us owe a real debt of gratitude towards he took the all in
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:13.520]   summit, which was a very strong start in 2022. And he leveled
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:17.440]   it up in 2023. Amazingly, and I'm just so excited to see what
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:23.400]   we do in 2024. With this amazing brand memberships, tequilas,
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:27.880]   another 50 episode and a great all in summit next year, I hope
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:32.120]   so shout out to my guy freeberg for the dictator, the Sultan of
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.880]   science, chairman dictator, sorry, apologize for getting
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:38.520]   that incorrect there. We'll get it right. Chairman dictator, and
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.400]   the rain man David Sachs, I am the world's greatest moderator
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:46.760]   and we will see you in 2024. Bye bye. Happy New Year. Love you
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.160]   guys. New Year bitches.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:48.800]   Bye bye.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:49.600]   Have your besties
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:52.440]   let your winners ride.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.280]   Rain Man David Sachs
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:01.920]   we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.520]   it. I love you. I'm the queen of quinoa.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:08.800]   Let your winners ride.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.440]   Besties are gone.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.960]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.760]   Oh man.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.360]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.200]   because they're all just useless. It's like this like
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.480]   sexual tension, but they just need to release them out.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:35.600]   We need to get
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:35.960]   merch.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:37.640]   Going on.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:46.200]   Oh, man.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.200]   [Music]
