[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   The Chinese have a view, understandably, for four or five thousand years,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.640]   they were the predominant power in all the world they knew.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.320]   They're Confucian. Harmony and peace comes from hierarchy.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.280]   They're at the top of the hierarchy. That's the normal place.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.840]   They were displaced from this by Westerners with technology 150 years ago.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.280]   They call that the century of humiliation.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.960]   And their aspiration is to go back to normal.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.720]   And normal for them is China is the quote "center of the universe."
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.320]   You can't have two tigers in the valley. There's the big one and the other one.
