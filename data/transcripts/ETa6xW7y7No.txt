[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.960]   Alright, let's fit in one last deep work question here. This
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.120]   one comes from Brandon.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.680]   Brandon says can intense collaborative work be
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.400]   considered deep?
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.880]   Yes.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.680]   Deep work has two elements. Cognitively demanding, so you're
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.560]   actually pushing your mental ability. So it's requiring real
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.960]   thought and it's done in a state without distraction. So you're
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.560]   not context shifting from the context of the work to other
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.560]   things. This could be with people. This could be on your
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.760]   own. I talk about this in my book, Deep Work, but it's often
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.640]   overlooked by people who will say, I don't do deep work
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.360]   because I'm in a collaborative field. But nothing about that
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.920]   definition has anything to do with being alone. I think we we
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.800]   get caught up on that idea because we have a notion of deep
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.840]   work as Neil Stevenson, you know, in his basement alone in
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.760]   his house writing the Quicksilver trilogy with a quill.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.320]   And yes, that is deep work. But also deep work is a collection
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.920]   of physicists at Bell Labs at a whiteboard that they're sharing
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.760]   trying to figure out how to make the transistor work. That's
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.280]   awful deep work. Deep work is also the mission control in
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.520]   Houston during Apollo 13 trying to figure out how to make the
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.560]   air filters from the command module work in the lunar module.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.040]   You're focusing really intensely on something cognitively
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.480]   demanding, you're not switching context. I even go so far as
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.960]   talking about in deep work, what I call the whiteboard effect,
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.120]   which says if you're working on something deep with someone
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.560]   else, you often can obtain higher levels of intensity than
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.840]   if you were just working on your own, because having another
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.240]   person they're staring at the same problem on a shared board
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.120]   raises the social cost of your attention wandering. Because
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.560]   then you're gonna have to say, hold on, hold on, back up, what
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.280]   were you just talking about there, you're pushing each other
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.800]   to go deeper. So actually, some of the deepest work comes in
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.000]   group settings. Brandon also asked about what if you're in
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.120]   like doing a therapy session, so this is he's a psychotherapist
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.960]   or teaching. That's all deep to kindly demanding, you're not
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.600]   switching context, the number of people in a room doesn't really
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.640]   matter.
