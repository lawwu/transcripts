[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   Is it a sin to back out of a commitment?
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.840]   Too often we write off a question like this for being too trivial for discussion.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.220]   It's not.
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.880]   It's not because the topic is addressed in Scripture.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.440]   Leading to an email from one female listener to the podcast, Morgan, a college student.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.000]   "Hello Pastor John, I'm grateful to God for your ministry and have been blessed in many
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.800]   ways by this podcast.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800]   I'm writing to you because there's a wedding soon for a friend.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.280]   I previously RSVP'd to say I would be there.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.320]   Now I don't think I can attend after being told about a school obligation I didn't know
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.120]   about until recently.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.280]   The RSVP was formal and has caused me internal conflict about a broader ethical question.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.880]   James says, 'Let your yes be yes and your no be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.'
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.880]   That's James 5.12.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.640]   And Jesus said, 'Don't make an oath, simply say yes or no and stick with it.'
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.920]   As in Matthew 5.34-37.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.880]   This is for me, part of a bigger question I have about backing out of commitments.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.040]   Is it sinful to do so?
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.720]   And in this case, since I already RSVP'd, should I honor my first commitment to the
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.400]   wedding at the expense of my college course?
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.120]   Pastor John, how inflexible are our commitments?"
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   I am deeply thankful that Morgan has a sensitive conscience.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.040]   A sensitive conscience specifically about speaking the truth and keeping her word.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.320]   She won't regret this.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.560]   This is biblical.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.380]   This is the way it should be.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.720]   We are not supposed to lie to each other or mislead each other or deceive each other or
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.720]   prove to be unreliable for each other.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.660]   Christians are people of truth.
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.920]   We love the truth.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.080]   We want to be trusted as people of the truth because our God is a God of truth.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.560]   He keeps his promises and so Morgan's concern is really, really good.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.640]   So what I would like to do is suggest that whether she should back out of this commitment
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.960]   or commitments in general depends on at least three factors.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:25.520]   One, how firm or perhaps better how qualified or unqualified was the commitment, implicit
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   or explicit?
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.400]   In other words, the qualifiedness or the unqualifiedness of it might have been explicit or implicit.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.920]   So those are the kind of questions to ask.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.600]   For example, when people ask me if I'm coming to something, I often say I plan to and I
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.720]   intend for them to hear a qualified intention to come.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.480]   I really am aiming to come, but I recognize that circumstances that come up might make
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.760]   it impossible or unwise to go.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:07.980]   So the question I'm raising is, is the nature of this commitment such that it communicated
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:18.240]   an unqualified pledge, promise, vow to be there, or does it communicate only a hearty,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.480]   honest intention to be there, barring other relatively important things?
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.280]   Now I want to take seriously Morgan's desire to get in line with Jesus and James' words
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.840]   about letting your yes be yes and your no be no without having to back up everything
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.200]   with an oath.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.120]   When Jesus said, "Let what you say be simply yes or no.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.320]   Anything more than this comes from evil," he meant something like this.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.400]   Don't be so unreliable or fickle that you have to use an oath for people to count on
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.080]   what you say.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.440]   Let your yes be yes and your no be no.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.000]   Let it mean something.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.300]   Now what I'm suggesting in this first factor is that Morgan's integrity and reliability
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:24.960]   and honesty need not be called into question for backing out if there was a mutual understanding
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.920]   that the context of a given commitment didn't have the standing of a pledge or an oath,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.240]   but a good faith intention which might be interrupted.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.440]   Now which leads to the second factor she should take into consideration.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.800]   Is the new competing engagement of such a kind that keeping it and backing out of the
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.440]   first one would be seen as more loving or more honorable?
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:04.560]   So the point here is that we can all imagine new competing minor engagements.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.520]   Say like she really wants to watch her favorite TV program and so she's not going to go.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.560]   Or we can imagine major engagements like my father passed away and his funeral is on the
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.380]   same day as the wedding and all kinds of differences in between that have a bearing on whether
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.120]   our decision to go or not go is perceived as honorable and loving.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.800]   When the Good Samaritan interrupted his travel plans to help the man on the side of the road
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.160]   in Luke 10, he may well have missed some important appointments.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.720]   I would say this happens fairly regularly in the pastoral ministry and elsewhere.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.840]   A pastor makes an appointment for 4 p.m. at the office.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.440]   The person has planned on it.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.240]   It's been on the books for four weeks.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.600]   And the pastor gets a call at 3.30 about an attempted suicide in his church.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.760]   Would he please hurry and come?
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.480]   We see an illustration of this kind of thing in 2 Corinthians 1.15.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.440]   Paul had evidently communicated to the church in Corinth that he was coming and then he
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.200]   had to change his plans.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.760]   We're not told why.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.760]   This got him into big trouble, being accused of fickle and duplicitousness.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.800]   And here's what he says.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.840]   This is 2 Corinthians 1.15 to 24.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.640]   Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this?
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.040]   Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say yes, yes, and no, no at the same
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.040]   time?
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.200]   Isn't that interesting that he would even use the same issue?
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   Amazing.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.520]   Verse 18, "As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been yes and no."
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.440]   Verse 23, "But I call God to witness against me.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.760]   It was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.360]   Not that we lorded over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.360]   firm in your faith."
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:20.560]   So Paul's defense for not following through on his initial plan was that he was motivated
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.040]   not by fear or selfishness or anything self-aggrandizing, but by love.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.400]   It was to spare you that I refrained from coming again.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:40.120]   So I think a crucial question is, is the new competing engagement of such a nature that
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:49.640]   backing out on the first one will be seen as more loving, more honorable, and for that
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:58.240]   reason will not be such a serious damage to our reputation as truth-loving, promise-keeping,
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.240]   reliable people?
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.800]   Now here's the last factor I think Morgan should take into consideration.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:12.840]   Is there a gracious way to honestly explain the situation, express support for the event
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.600]   that you committed to go to, and then ask for release from the commitment?
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.320]   I don't think there are very many commitments that we make.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.160]   Of course, marriage vows would be a huge exception to this, but I don't think there are very
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:34.360]   many commitments that we make in which it wouldn't be fitting to honor the person we
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:41.440]   made the commitment to by explaining a new situation that has come up and asking kindly,
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.640]   humbly, if they would release us for that commitment.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.920]   I think that would be my first approach in Morgan's case.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:59.160]   Call them up, explain the situation, offer sincere support for what you're missing, and
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.940]   ask for a discharge, so to speak.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.320]   My guess is that most people would feel very honored that you would go to the trouble to
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.000]   do that.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.980]   But let me end by saying again how encouraging it is to me to see Morgan's vigilance over
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:24.840]   her word and her desire to be a person whose yes is yes and whose no is no.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.880]   That is the way it should be.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for the clarification here, even from Paul's own ministry.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   That was very interesting.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Thank you for that.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.120]   And thank you for listening.
