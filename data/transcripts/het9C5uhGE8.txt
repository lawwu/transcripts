[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Governor, I'm making this pitch directly to you.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.760]   It's something that's really important.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.420]   It's about the mask situation.
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.740]   As I'm sure you've heard, the CDC now recommends that we all wear masks.
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.000]   But this message to you is to tell you that that is not enough.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.920]   You see, the thing is modeling shows that unless we get 80% of the population to wear
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.520]   masks, this isn't going to work.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.680]   If we do get 80% to wear masks, the virus we expect will be completely blown away, transmission
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.960]   will be stopped.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.000]   That's how important this is to the economy and to people's lives.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.080]   I'm going to share with you two things now.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.240]   The first is a segment I just did on CNN, and the reason I'm going to share it is that
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.320]   at the end of the segment, they asked the viewers, would you wear a mask?
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.340]   92% of a sample of 20,000 said yes.
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.240]   This is a message that Americans can get behind.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.960]   The problem is, though, we need nearly everybody to actually turn that into action, not just
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.200]   a poll on a TV station.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.040]   So we need enforcement.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.920]   I've already drafted up a simple piece of a law.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.800]   It's actually based on the law that's already in Laredo, but I've done something extra to
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   it.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.900]   I've actually added a carve-out for N95.
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.280]   In other words, if you use this executive order, then it will be saying to people, you
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.760]   have to have a mask outside in public, but, well, in shops, gas stations, stuff like that,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.200]   unless it's an N95 mask.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.620]   That's not okay.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.600]   So if you use this approach, you're actually going to get two things at once.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.400]   You're going to ensure more supply for the hospitals who really need that vital PPE,
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.720]   because there's no point hoarding something that no one's allowed to use anymore.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.720]   You're going to save lives and get the economy back up and running much sooner.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.440]   So have a look at the segment, and then after that segment, if you're still wondering whether
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.920]   the science makes sense, there's a really great video from a top pathologist who explains
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.640]   why this really is the right approach.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.640]   If you're interested in talking more about this, please feel free to reach straight out
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640]   to me.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.760]   I've made an email address just for this, policy@masksforall.co.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.040]   You can see the text down at the bottom there.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.280]   All right, I hope this works, and the sooner we can do it, the better, because things are
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.900]   changing every day, and actually I'm going to be on TV talking about this pretty soon,
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.880]   and I'd love to be able to show some good news.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.960]   Who was the governor in America who was the first to move on this?
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.960]   That would be history-making.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.760]   Thanks very much for listening.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.360]   At the height of the HIV crisis, authorities did not tell people to put away condoms.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.080]   As fatalities from car crashes mounted, nobody recommended avoiding seatbelts, yet in a global
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.700]   respiratory pandemic, people who should know better are discouraging Americans from using
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.320]   respiratory protection.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.080]   Jeremy Howard is a distinguished research scientist at the University of San Francisco.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.200]   He wrote those words for The Washington Post.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.880]   Mr. Howard, the WHO initially said, "You only need to wear a mask if you're taking care
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.440]   of a person with a suspected COVID-19 infection."
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.320]   How did they get it so wrong?
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.680]   Well, we now know that about 50 percent of people that are infected have no symptoms.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.720]   We also know that during the first week is when people are most infectious, when they're
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.560]   least likely to have symptoms.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.280]   So what the WHO did here was that they did not err on the side of caution.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.760]   They weren't quite sure of the science, and so they said, "Don't do it."
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.120]   What they should have said is, "Do do it," because what we now know is, or we strongly
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.860]   guess, is that if 80 percent of people in a community wear a face mask, any kind of
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.660]   cloth cover, it can actually stop the virus in its tracks.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.200]   So here is the cloth cover that I am using.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.940]   I don't know if you can see it.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.280]   When I wear it, am I doing so to protect myself or to protect you?
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.820]   Primarily, you're doing it to do your bit in the community to protect others.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.200]   We know that this disease spreads when we talk.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.660]   Little droplets fly out of our mouth, so small you can't see them.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.980]   It just makes obvious sense, and the science shows any kind of cloth cover stops that.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.080]   It's actually been estimated by Yale researchers this week that each person wearing a single
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:29.140]   mask has a value of at least $4,000 to $6,000 due to the huge impact it has on transmission.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.400]   There's some stunning data that you have provided me represented in graphs.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.620]   I'll put it on the screen showing South Korea side by side with Italy, pretty self-explanatory.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.260]   But please provide the background.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.560]   Well, the really interesting background is that until late February, a lot of folks in
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.220]   South Korea couldn't get masks, and they were also continuing their kind of cultural approach
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.660]   of only wearing masks when they had symptoms.
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.860]   Everything changed in late February.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.140]   The government stepped in and ensured that everybody had access to a mask.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.140]   And you can see what happened.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.620]   But before that, they were on track with Italy to be as bad as Italy, and then suddenly everything
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.620]   turned around.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.220]   And now the number of cases there is decreasing without even a lockdown.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.540]   I made reference to what the president had to say yesterday, the sort of juxtaposition
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.660]   of announcing this CDC recommendation and then saying that he himself wouldn't be engaging
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.660]   in that behavior.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.580]   I want to roll a small piece of audio -- video, pardon me -- from this, and then I ask a question.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.580]   Show it.
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.100]   This is voluntary.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.420]   I don't think I'm going to be doing it, but you have a lot of ways you can look at it
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.420]   as follows.
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.860]   The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or fabric mask that can be either
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.760]   purchased online or simply made at home, probably material that you'd have at home.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.740]   What does your review of the data from around the globe show as to the issue of cultural
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.700]   difference or even vanity?
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.940]   I know that you looked at the Czech Republic.
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.940]   Right.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.420]   I was really surprised to find that, actually, there's lots of examples now of countries
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.940]   that have gone all in on this and are in the West.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.460]   Israel, it's the law.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.700]   Czech Republic, it's the law.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.140]   Austria, it's the law.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.740]   Slovakia, it's the law.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.700]   And like in the Czech Republic, not only is it the law, they are so proud now to wear
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.900]   their masks.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.620]   If somebody is behind you in the shopping line to do your weekly essential shopping
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.020]   and they're not wearing a mask, in the Czech Republic, people will look at that person
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.180]   now and say, why aren't they doing their bit?
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.600]   We know that COVID-19 is like a silent assassin now.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.580]   As you walk around the streets, you could be killing people without knowing it.
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.020]   Masks are the closest thing we have right now to this kind of imperfect vaccine.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.860]   Science just this week in nature shows that in studies, 100 percent of people that were
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:54.480]   tested, simple cloth covering stopped the transmission of those critical droplets.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.060]   To beat the coronavirus, everyone should wear a mask.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.060]   Hello, everyone.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.540]   I am Dr. Chris Martinson, and I'm here to tell you how we're going to beat this coronavirus.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.700]   I've been reporting on this coronavirus for 70 days.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.060]   I have a PhD in pathology from Duke University, and I want to take you through the logic of
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.060]   why everyone should wear a face mask.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.340]   It begins here with all these things that we can do, that we need to do to beat this
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.580]   particular virus.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.620]   It begins here, but this is one of the most important steps right here, face masks for
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.620]   everyone.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.620]   Now, why is that?
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.860]   Well, here's what we know.
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:33.080]   We know that this particular virus, it spreads really quickly and easily from both symptomatic
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.220]   and asymptomatic people.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.340]   Let's imagine this woman here, she's got a perfectly normal temperature, but she can
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.460]   have the virus and be communicating it.
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.540]   Here's how you get this virus.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:51.020]   Somebody who's infected gets a particle outside of their body, and that goes into your body.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.900]   We know that very large infectious droplets fall out of the air very quickly.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.820]   Smaller ones travel much further, but really tiny infectious droplet nuclei, they travel
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.620]   really far.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.540]   These can form and they're super small, so they just blow around in the air.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.580]   I'm going to show you a little bit about that.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:16.420]   It's not just that somebody who's sneezing or coughing is passing this to other people.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.900]   How do we beat this thing?
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.740]   Very simple solution to a very complex problem.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.700]   Everybody wears a mask.
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.100]   Here's the logic behind that.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.100]   Reason one.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.060]   I'm going to give you three reasons why everyone should wear a mask.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:35.080]   Number one is it stops infected people from expelling infectious particles.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.380]   Remember these things up here?
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.900]   We want to keep those particles not out in the air.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.180]   We want to keep them inside our masks.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.700]   Let's look at the difference here.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.740]   In this GIF right here, we're seeing somebody who's sneezing just into the air.
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.660]   Look at all those particles flying, and then yes, there is still stuff sneaking around
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:58.760]   the edges here, but look how much material got caught in the mask material itself.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.460]   Here's another great piece of research that came out very recently.
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:08.940]   This shows the tiny particles that are being spread around when people are just talking.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.480]   You see big particles falling out.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.180]   You see little ones floating around.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.100]   Every one of these is a particle that could be carrying infectious disease particles,
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.140]   viruses in there that could make you sick.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.220]   Reason number one, everyone wears a mask, is so that the people who are sick are not
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.880]   spreading infected droplets all over the place.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.020]   Reason number two that everyone wears a mask is it helps remind you not to touch the insides
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.900]   of your mouth or your nose.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.860]   What we need to know is that, I hate this saying, don't touch your face because you
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.860]   know why?
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.760]   Because the virus doesn't come in through your face.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.220]   It comes in through your mouth, and it comes in through your nose.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.340]   It's also possible it can come in through the eyes, but a mask at least, if you're wearing
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:56.100]   a mask that covers up this part right here, you are not breathing those particles in to
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.860]   the places in your upper nose where the virus can bind or down in your lungs where the virus
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.020]   can also bind and begin replicating.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.640]   That is reason number two.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.700]   It helps to remind you not to touch the insides of your mouth or your nose.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.860]   In fact, it will physically prevent you, that's what a mask will do, prevent you from touching
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.780]   the inside of your mouth and your nose.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.300]   What's reason number three?
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.380]   Reason number three, really, really important.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.660]   Look, if somehow these little particles get out and if you get one of those little particles
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:33.860]   inside your mask, you will still get ill potentially, but if you are infected anyway, you have a
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.940]   much, much better chance of starting small, that is with a low inoculum, and that gives
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.140]   you a much better disease outcome.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.940]   There's an opinion piece in the New York Times by a couple of doctors here, and I love what
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.940]   they said.
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:53.420]   They say here, "Both large and small amounts of virus can replicate within our cells cause
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.540]   severe disease in vulnerable individuals, such as the immunocompromised.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.340]   In healthy people, however, immune systems respond as soon as they sense a virus growing
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.340]   inside.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:09.220]   Recovery depends on which wins the race, viral spread or immune activation.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:14.860]   Virus experts know that viral dose affects the severity, the illness severity.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.860]   Viral dose.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.820]   So, in the lab, mice receiving a low dose of virus clear it and recover while the same
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.540]   virus at a higher dose kills them.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.500]   Dose sensitivity has been observed for every common acute viral infection that has been
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.320]   studied in lab animals, including coronaviruses.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.340]   So that's reason number three, gives you better odds of a lesser illness.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.740]   If you do get a tiny virus particle through your mask, it will come in, but it'll be tiny.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.260]   It'll be a small dose that increases your odds.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.680]   So the three reasons everyone wears a mask, it stops the infected people from spreading
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.880]   it around.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.020]   It helps prevent you from touching your mouth and your nose in particular.
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.140]   And if you do get infected anyway, much better odds that you're starting small with a low
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:04.180]   inoculum and that gives you a better disease outcome, a better chance of fighting it off.
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.300]   I want you to tune out all sorts of illogical articles out there that say things like this,
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:13.520]   which is a, well, you know, even masks that fit well against the face will not prevent
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.300]   inhalation of small particles.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:21.140]   So this is saying it's not perfect, never let perfect become the enemy of the good enough.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.580]   This person is making the argument that homemade masks is all worrying because there's some
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.060]   evidence that fabric masks can increase your risk of infection, but they're quoting clinical
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.620]   studies where nurses and doctors were around super infected people wearing homemade masks.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.940]   That's not what we're talking about.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.940]   All right.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.500]   How do we beat this thing?
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.700]   Everybody wears a mask.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.060]   It prevents the spread.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.660]   It reminds us not to touch our mouth and our nose, and it gives you a better odds of a
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.660]   lesser illness.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.040]   So what sorts of masks, hey, all kinds of masks, just not the ones with the little valves
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   on them.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.540]   We don't want those because those allow infected things to pass out of our, our mouths really
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.200]   easily in our nose.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.660]   So any of these totally good, but you know what else is good and better than nothing
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:06.020]   because we need these right now for the medical frontline healthcare providers.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.260]   Don't get these.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.220]   Let's leave these right now later when supplies come back and they're ample for everyone.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.220]   These are the best.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.140]   But what do we do until then?
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.320]   Wonderful cottage industry of people making their own homegrown, a sewn mask, home sewn
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.580]   mask here, here with an insert of a HEPA filter.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.140]   I bet this thing's doing a really good job, but you know what?
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.640]   It's doing a whole lot better than nothing.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.060]   Remember people sneezing that stuff all out.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:35.320]   And by the way, you can find these face masks and all over the place.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.700]   People are making them, donating them.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.660]   It's a wonderful, wonderful thing that's happening here.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.920]   So this is how we beat this thing.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   We join together.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   We create face masks and we always, always, always wear a mask in public, whether we think
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.000]   we're healthy or not, or don't know, or we're sick.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.240]   Any reason at all when everybody's wearing a face mask, we will beat this thing.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.040]   Thank you for listening.
