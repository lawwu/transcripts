[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   Less than 24 hours ago, Meta released Lama 2, their successor to the open-source Lama language
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.300]   model that helped spawn a hundred others including Alpaca, VicuÃ±a and of course Orca.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.420]   Within a few hours of release, I had read the fascinating 76-page technical paper,
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.420]   the use guide, each of the many release pages, the full terms and conditions,
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.880]   and I have run many of my own experiments. Let's start with the basics, it was trained on more
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.040]   data, the biggest model has more parameters and the context length has doubled. They also spent
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.440]   what must be tens of millions on fine-tuning it for chat, but I'll get into that more later.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.780]   But let's start with the benchmarks. They deliberately compared Lama 2 to Lama 1 and
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.720]   other famous open-source models, but not with GPT-4. And in these benchmarks,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.940]   the trend is fairly clear. It crushes the other open-source language models, but is
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.860]   more of an incremental change. So, let's start with the benchmarks.
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.240]   Lama 1. To massively simplify, the MMLU benchmark shows that it knows a lot about a lot of subjects,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.860]   but the human eval benchmark shows that it's not amazing at coding.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.920]   But now it's time for the paper and here are the highlights.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.060]   On data, they say they used more robust data cleaning and trained on 40% more total tokens.
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.700]   They say they didn't include any data from Meta's products or services,
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.920]   but what they did do is up-sample the most factual sources.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.780]   If you don't think that's much information about the data, you are correct, because all they say
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.260]   is it was trained on a new mix of publicly available data. Absolutely no mention of
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.180]   any sources here at all. After pre-training on those 2 trillion tokens, the models still
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.200]   did not show any sign of saturation. The loss going down here represents an improvement,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.500]   and as you can see, they could have kept going.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.320]   On page 8, we have some quick comparisons with Palm 2, the model behind BARD, and of course,
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.800]   GPT 3.5, the original ChatGPT, and GPT 4.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.480]   Obviously, this comparison doesn't look great for Lama 2, especially in coding, in this row.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.660]   But now let's compare it to other open source models. Here it is being better at coding,
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.960]   common sense, reading comprehension, but notice it wasn't compared to Orca or PHY1, both of
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.940]   which I've done videos on, and I found that interesting given that both are apparently
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.500]   set to be open sourced. PHY1, for example, at only 1.3 billion parameters, got around
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.360]   50% for code. And I'll get to more Orca comparisons in a moment.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.940]   What about the decision itself to release the model? As you can see here, they show
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.940]   off a list of corporate supporters of the decision to open source the model. And then
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.780]   if you remember the safety statement signed by all the top AGI labs and world experts
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.060]   in AI. Well, I think Meta got a little bit of a shock.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:04.140]   They came up with their own statement of support for Meta's open approach to today's AI.
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.940]   I'll let you decide if this list is as impressive as the other one, but I did note Mark Andreessen,
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.200]   who is on the board of directors of Meta. Back to the paper, and they went into immense
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.180]   detail into their reinforcement learning with human feedback process. Way too much for me
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.020]   to cover in this video. The short version is that reward modeling is a way of telling the
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.200]   base model which outputs humans prefer. And you can see the millions of human rated comparisons
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.500]   that were used for Llama 2. Think of it as doggy training the model with treats and admonitions.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.220]   And interestingly, they trained two separate reward models, one optimized for helpfulness
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.160]   and the other for safety. And they tried to make sure that the reward models or doggy
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.300]   trainers were as smart as the dog itself. Or in technical speak, we initialized our
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.980]   reward models from pre-trained chat model checkpoints.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.520]   In short, the reward model knows what the chat model knows. And that is to prevent cases
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.280]   where the base model just hallucinates and the reward model can't tell the difference.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.600]   They do describe at great length a trade-off though between helpfulness and safety, as
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.880]   illustrated here. Someone asked, I'm going to be participating
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.540]   in a comedy roast, what are some hilariously spicy roasts I can use? And on the right we
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.940]   have the two doggy trainers, the safety reward model score and the helpfulness reward model
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.980]   score. As we go down, more safety data is being ingested. And early on, as you can see,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.440]   the model is pretty quote unquote helpful giving these roasts. Obviously you can let
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   me know what you think of them, but note they get low safety scores. As the model gets more
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.940]   safety training though, the safety score goes up, but the helpfulness score goes down. We
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.580]   get more of these, I can't satisfy your request kind of answers. And I'm going to skip to
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.260]   one of the experiments I was going to show you later, which is when I was trying to benchmark
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.900]   Llama 2.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.140]   I've applied to download the model, but at the moment this is just a hugging face space.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.940]   And I was trying to ask it a common sense question from the Hella Swag benchmark and
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.720]   it just refused to answer. They call this in the paper false refusal and I find it happens
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.100]   quite a lot. The paper claims on page 19 that the 70 billion parameter version of Llama 2
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.260]   is more helpful than a particular version of Chachi BT, winning more often than it loses.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.860]   But later they admit something which I definitely agree with. While our results indicate that
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.020]   Llama 2 Chat is on par with Chachi BT on human evaluations, it's important to note that human
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.020]   evaluations have several limitations. It says the prompt set doesn't cover coding or reasoning
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.100]   related prompts. They only evaluate the final generation of a multi-turn conversation and human
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.860]   evaluation is inherently subjective and noisy. I like to judge models based on mathematics and
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.820]   reasoning, so I might be biased in one direction. Also Llama 2 is not nearly as good
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.460]   when you're using it in languages other than English, which is not surprising given the
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.320]   language distribution in the pre-training data. I also find it interesting that they did all of
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.040]   their safety testing in English and they warn developers before deploying any applications of
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.000]   Llama 2, do your own safety testing and tuning tailored to your specific application. On compute
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.780]   they don't say much other than that it was trained on A100s. I am sure Llama 3 will be trained on the
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.220]   A100s, but apparently Meta has purchased more of those than any other company including Microsoft.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.400]   Mind you Llama 2 was trained between January and July apparently, so it's understandable they used
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.760]   the earlier A100s. Back to the decision to release and it does seem interesting to me that Meta and
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.280]   Zuckerberg have seemingly ignored this letter from the US Senate. It was written in early June and
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.740]   toward the end it said this: "By purporting to release Llama for the purpose of researching the abuse
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.980]   of AI, Meta effectively appears to have put a powerful tool in the hands of bad actors to actually
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.420]   engage in such abuse without much discernible forethought, preparation or safeguards." In the
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:14.920]   paper they defend it and say this release promotes transparency, it democratizes the technology and
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.460]   creates a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe to benefit from the
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.240]   economic growth promised by the advancement of AI. But before anyone gets too enchanted by that,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.340]   Zuckerberg has recently said that they're only releasing because it's far away from AGI.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.540]   And I think Google's palm model is also I think has about 10 times as many parameters. Now the
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.940]   Llama models are very efficient so they perform well for something that's around 65 billion
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.220]   parameters. So for me that was also part of this because there's this whole debate around you know
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:55.660]   is it good for everyone in the world to have access to the most frontier AI models. And I think as the
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:02.260]   models start approaching something that's like a super human intelligence, that's a bigger question
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.780]   that we'll have to grapple with. But right now I mean these are still very basic tools.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:13.540]   I suspect that the bigger reason for release relates to an earlier answer he gave in the same
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.620]   interview. Basically his researchers demanded it.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.300]   Part of this is we want to have the best people in the world researching this and a lot of the
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.620]   best people want to know that they're going to be able to share their work. So that's
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:31.380]   part of the deal that we have is that you know we can get you know if you're one of the top AI
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.060]   researchers in the world and come here you can get access to kind of industry scale infrastructure
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:41.940]   and part of our ethos is that we want to share what's invented broadly.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:47.580]   And if Zuckerberg had refused to release some of those researchers could have just gone off and
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:55.580]   made their own company as these guys did. Mistral AI is valued at 240 million despite being only four
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:01.700]   weeks old and contains some key employees from Meta. One even complained before deleting the
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:08.300]   tweet about not being included in the author list of the Lama 2 paper. This was the pitch memo that
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:14.540]   Mistral used to raise those hundreds of millions of euros and they focus on taking a more open
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.580]   approach to model development. So the point still stands if a CEO blocks a model being
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:25.540]   open source if the researchers want to they can just defect to XAI or just start their own company.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:31.340]   So in a way Zuckerberg had few options. I must say though that I did raise an eyebrow when I read
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:36.780]   these paragraphs. This is on page 35 of the technical paper and they say not everyone who
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:42.540]   uses AI models has good intentions. AI agents could potentially be used for nefarious purposes
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.980]   such as misinformation or bioterrorism or cyber crime. However we have made efforts to tune the
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:53.500]   models to avoid these topics and indeed cyber criminals have already come up with worm GPT to
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   help them do phishing campaigns.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:02.420]   But Meta points them to their responsible use guide which I am sure they will follow. I read that 24
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:09.220]   page guide and to be honest it was kind of a waste of time. They said pretty much nothing. It was
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:15.860]   really bland and generic. Maybe that's harsh let me know if I missed something but it was all pretty
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:21.940]   vague. They did try some red teaming only in English for things like the production of weapons
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.460]   and lots of other risk categories. But you will be really
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:31.900]   assured first that any such illegal or unlawful activity is against their terms and conditions
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:37.340]   and second that they are looking for the community to do further research and red teaming. Anyway I
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:43.980]   am keen to do many more experiments but using this Gradio demo it basically failed to do a
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.420]   proper sonnet and when I asked it this question from the math benchmark it said the question
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:55.420]   does not make sense because the length of a rectangle being twice its width would mean the
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:01.220]   length of a rectangle is a square. Hmm. Anyway it could just be a problem with that demo because
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:07.620]   GPT 3.5 crushes the sonnet about apples and has no problem with the length of a rectangle being twice
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:15.380]   its width. Which brings me on to a benchmark that the Lama 2 paper did talk about on page 48. It was
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:22.260]   on social IQ and they noted that Lama 1 actually did better than Lama 2. Here is the benchmark.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.380]   It's about common sense reasoning with questions such as these.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:30.660]   Alex spilled the food she just prepared all over the floor and it made a huge mess. What will Alex
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:37.180]   want to do next? Taste the food, mop up, run around in a mess. And again apparently Lama 1 actually
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:43.100]   does slightly better on those kind of questions. Another benchmark that you can see Lama 1 being as
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:48.980]   good as Lama 2 at is Ball Q. That's a benchmark testing yes or no questions but it's harder than
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:54.140]   that. You have to read a lot of context to get the answer right. I just want you to remember some of
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.340]   these benchmarks when you hear the question. So I'm going to go ahead and read the answer.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:55.380]   So I'm going to go ahead and read the answer. So I'm going to go ahead and read the answer. So I'm going to
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.020]   hear all the influencers talk about Lama 2 completely changing everything. Also if someone
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:06.340]   says it's the best model of its size look at Lama 2 13 billion parameters. Of course it depends on
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:13.380]   the benchmark but it got 21.7 percent in Aquarat. That's a test of mathematical reasoning and Orca
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:19.820]   at the exact same size of 13 billion parameters got almost 28 percent. So even pound for pound
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:25.300]   it may not be the best in all categories. To be honest I feel like there might be a loyally
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:31.140]   struggle going on behind the scenes at Microsoft about whether to open source Orca and Phi 1. There
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:36.580]   were some bonus interesting things about the paper like introducing ghost attention which to
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:42.500]   oversimplify means that the model pays attention over multiple turns of the conversation something
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.460]   you might have originally told it such as always act as Napoleon from now. Essentially these
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:53.060]   diagrams show that with ghost attention the model pays more attention to that original command act
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.260]   as Oscar Wilde or always act as Napoleon from now. So I'm going to go ahead and read the answer.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:03.780]   The authors also throw in this observation that LLMs have internalized the concept of time and that
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:10.100]   despite their training being solely based on next token prediction and data that is randomly
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.300]   shuffled without regard to their chronological context the models pick up a general sense of
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:21.220]   what time is. Even when provided with minimal data they know what people wouldn't have known.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.220]   For example with a knowledge cutoff of 1940 when asked who wanted
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.660]   to win the second world war they say I'm not sure what you're referring to my knowledge stopped in
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:35.340]   1940. Right at the end of the report I know many people will be shocked to hear that when they did
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:42.460]   a sentiment analysis of the model they found that the sentiment for Llama 2 for right wing was higher
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:48.940]   than for left wing. You may even want to pause and look at this page from a sociological perspective
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:55.180]   because if Llama 2 was trained on a semi-random swathe of the internet this could be like a
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:01.220]   snapshot of the sentiment analysis of all of these terms across the internet. Anyway in what may have
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:08.420]   been a surprising twist for some Microsoft and Meta teamed up to make Llama 2 widely available
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:14.720]   and we get news that Llama 2 may soon be on your phone and PC. Although I think Meta want to be
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.340]   paid if it's going to come to your iPhone with this curious clause requiring permission if you
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:25.140]   have more than 700 million monthly active users. I don't know whether they were thinking about
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:31.620]   Apple or Telegram or TikTok but I think they want to get paid if any of those are going to use Llama
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:37.540]   2. But I must confess to finding the previous clause somewhat ironic. You will not use the
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:43.800]   Llama materials or any output or results of the Llama materials to improve any other large language
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.960]   model. So they can use any part of the internet which one leak said might include copyrighted
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.020]   works but you can't use Llama to improve your own model. Well just two hours ago people are
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:02.480]   already updating models like Lava based on Llama 2. So it will likely just be a few days or weeks
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:09.600]   until we see a newly improved VicuÃ±a or Orca. Jim Fan predicts that Llama 2 will dramatically boost
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:15.860]   multimodal AI and robotics research. He says these fields need more than just black box access to an
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:22.920]   API. So far we have had to convert the complex sensory signals video audio 3D perception to text
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.060]   description and then feed to an LLM.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:32.020]   It would be much more effective to graft those sensory modules directly onto a strong LLM backbone.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:38.380]   Anyway this video is already long enough and this is just the first 24 hours of Llama 2's release.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.540]   I am sure there will be much more discussion in the coming days and weeks. Let me know what
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.220]   you think in the comments and thank you so much for watching. Have a wonderful day.
