[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300]   Well, how much media is too much media?
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.220]   In the digital age, this is a question that we all face all the time, and it's a question
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.020]   with implications for our relationships, too.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.740]   It's a dilemma faced by one young woman who listens to the podcast and writes us today.
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.220]   "Hello, Pastor John and Tony.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.380]   Thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.380]   I have been learning a lot about the conscience lately and how some things affect me in varying
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.660]   degrees compared to other Christians.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.860]   I know I cannot pass judgment on those who do not share my convictions of conscience
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.700]   on things that are not inherently sinful.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.460]   But I do struggle to apply my convictions to group settings, specifically the watching
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.260]   of constant television and playing of video games.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.840]   As an adult, these things weigh heavy on my conscience.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.480]   These are the things my family, who I still live with, and my friends maintain as part
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.820]   of their daily lifestyles.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.260]   If I listen to my conscience and not participate, my time spent with them is greatly reduced.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.860]   But if I do participate, the weight on my conscience brings me great misery.
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.540]   I ask them, but get nowhere because it's not a clear sin issue.
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.780]   So how do I live in a space that does not share my convictions with love and grace,
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.340]   and especially when it comes to screens?"
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.140]   I suspect that in the modern technological age that we have entered, especially an age
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.480]   of ever-present visual entertainment created within the framework of a God-ignoring or
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:42.520]   God-hostile worldview, I suspect that in this new entertainment-saturated world, the pursuit
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.100]   of purity of heart and possessing the mind of Christ and setting our affections on things
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.820]   that are above and being renewed in the spirit of our thoughts and being transformed in our
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.380]   emotions and keeping our lives unstained from the sinfulness of the world and laying up
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.060]   treasures in heaven and not on earth and keeping a clear vision of light, the light of the
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.460]   gospel of the glory of Christ, and enjoying the daily fellowship of the Son of God and
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.940]   having the eyes of our hearts enlightened to know what is the hope of our calling and
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.900]   the riches of the glory of our inheritance and the immeasurable greatness of God's
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.820]   power toward believers and the taste of the age to come and freedom from the desires of
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.940]   the eyes and the desires of the flesh and the pride of life and the power of the Spirit
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.820]   in our inner being and a clear sight of the breadth and length and height and depth of
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.380]   the love of Christ and the enjoyment of all the fullness of God, I suspect that in this
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:02.700]   new world of incessant screen time, whether widescreen TV or computer or tablet or smartphone,
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.540]   all these precious marks of what it means to be real Christians will require a kind
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:19.980]   of radical recovery of the ancient early church commitment to be more intentionally detached
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.540]   from the patterns of the world, especially the patterns of entertainment for the sake
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.220]   of the everlasting enjoyment of the greatness of Christ.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:41.980]   For decades, most Christians have simply drifted into the embrace of the patterns of the world
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.100]   in the way we spend our evenings and our weekends, with the exception of a couple hours for church
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.660]   on Sunday.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.460]   At first, this drift seemed harmless because there was such an overlap between the supposedly
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.900]   Christian worldview and the products of the media and entertainment empires.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.620]   That overlap was not as great as we thought it was.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.740]   At least, I think I really blew it as a kid and didn't see it.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.260]   It was superficially Christian in that many taboos in the culture were still shared with
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.900]   everybody, but God was absent and we scarcely noticed, let alone were heart sick or offended.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.860]   But now that superficial overlap of media culture and Christian culture is very small.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:42.300]   And the vast majority of programs and movies are through and through void, not only of
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:50.060]   God and Christ and any worthy advocates for his greatness or his righteousness, but also
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.660]   increasingly void of any restraints on the celebration of sin.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:04.980]   Sin is consistently destigmatized and normalized in what Christians watch with pleasure.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.020]   And yet, even though these changes have happened, most Christians have not altered their pattern
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.060]   of immersion in that entertainment culture for their own enjoyment.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:25.620]   Therefore, millions of Christians find themselves pleased with God-omitting, Christ-neglecting,
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:34.180]   man-centered, ego-exalting, sexually titillating, sin-normalizing entertainment night after
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.380]   night.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.620]   The effect of this is a church that more and more absorbs the intuitions, the instincts,
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.100]   the reflexes, the preferences, the desires of the world.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:56.980]   The church that regularly makes the world the source of its relaxation and enjoyment
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.180]   must become a worldly church.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.420]   And a worldly church is a powerless church.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.300]   It will not experience the fullness of the Holy Spirit and boldness in prayer and courage
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.740]   in witness and readiness to sacrifice for the salvation of lost people and for the exaltation
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.980]   of Christ.
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:27.840]   You cannot feel brokenhearted over lost people when you enjoy night after night being entertained
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.780]   by them in their lostness.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:39.420]   This is why I said to be a real Christian in the days ahead will require a kind of radical
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:48.460]   recovery of the ancient early church commitment to being more intentionally detached from
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.340]   the patterns of the world, especially the patterns of entertainment.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:02.220]   I do believe that God will raise up a generation who are so thrilled with what they gain in
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:09.340]   God and Christ and salvation and the way of righteousness and the sacrifices of love that
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:17.240]   they will not be intimidated by the accusations that they are a new kind of fundamentalist.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.540]   They will joyfully recover with seriousness and joy.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:29.260]   The words of the apostle when he said, "What agreement has the temple of God with idols?
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.220]   For we are the temple of the living God.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.580]   As God said, 'I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.420]   God and they shall be my people.'
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:47.180]   Therefore go out from their midst and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no one
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.140]   clean thing.
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.880]   Then I will welcome you and I will be a father to you and you shall be sons and daughters
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.500]   to me, says the Lord Almighty."
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.480]   Second Corinthians 6, 16 to 18.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:09.580]   The recovery of this kind of radical detachment from the emptiness of the world will not be
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.780]   for its own sake.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:19.380]   We will not make the mistake of thinking that separation for the sake of separation is a
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.740]   Christ-exalting virtue.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.100]   It's not.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:30.100]   We will say no for the sake of the glorious, all-satisfying yes.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:37.140]   We will say no to being children of the age because of the spectacular privilege of being
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.700]   sons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:48.980]   We will say no to the short-term, unsatisfying titillation of our lusts for the sake of the
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:55.020]   deep, profound satisfaction of savoring Christ and serving him with the conviction that it
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.180]   is more blessed to give than to receive.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:04.260]   We will say no to the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and the pride
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:11.700]   of life because we are on a quest for something vastly deeper and higher and richer and fuller
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:18.920]   and more lasting than anything secular entertainment can offer.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.460]   This will not be easy.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:28.700]   The young woman who has written this question is showing us what we are up against.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:35.020]   Sons of Christians simply default to TV watching and video games.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.260]   They are not yet awakened to what's happening to them.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:46.540]   And the fact that they would resent someone's discontent with their pattern of entertainment
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:52.400]   is simply more evidence of how profoundly saturated they have become with the spirit
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.740]   of the age.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:01.940]   My simple counsel to this young woman is that she thank God for the direction her conscience
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:10.620]   is pointing and that she put all her focus on cultivating a great and glorious yes to
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:17.540]   God and his kingdom and his righteousness and his promises and his fellowship so that
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:27.700]   whatever "no" she must speak and live toward her family, it would point mainly to
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:33.640]   a great and better "yes," the glory of Christ.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:39.300]   You won't regret it and neither will they if Paul's words become your passion.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.180]   Since then, you have been raised with Christ.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:49.660]   Take the things that are above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:56.660]   Set your mind on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:02.700]   The pleasures found in this path are greater and they last forever.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.700]   Amen.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.700]   Wow.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.700]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.700]   This is a great question.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.700]   Thank you for the response.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.700]   Wonderful response.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:14.500]   If you have a great question like this one for us about media or social media or gaming,
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:20.940]   go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn and from there you can send us an email with your question.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:28.620]   Well, every day in America, the strong murder the weak, and it's all legal.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:34.940]   It's legal for the strong to murder the weak in America because Americans have grabbed
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:40.500]   a God-like power to determine what is real and what is not real, who is human and who
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.220]   is subhuman.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.260]   On Wednesday, Pastor John will explain this absolute tragedy.
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.500]   We are, of course, talking about the unborn.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.140]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.820]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.820]   [END]
