[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians in chapter four, and reading the first seven
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   verses. The first seven verses in the fourth chapter of Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not, but
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   have lust, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves you are servants
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   for Jesus' sake. For God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   But we have this treasure in earth and vessel, that the excellency of the power may be of
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   God, and not of us. I have read those verses once more, and included
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   the seventh verse on this occasion, because, as those who have been attending here regularly
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   will know, that for the last six Sunday evenings, this being the seventh occasion, we have been
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   looking at this great statement which the apostle makes here, concerning not only the
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   content of his preaching, but also the very manner of his preaching. And indeed, the two
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   things as he shows us are intimately related. He is very concerned that these Corinthians
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   should realize that he was not out for a personal following, he was not out for personal popularity.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   He is astute of it, he hates all that. It is the one thing, in a sense, he is afraid
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   of. And he tells us that his method is not to handle the word of God deceitfully, but
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   simply to manifest the truth, and thereby commend himself to every man's conscience.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Well, he is preaching in the sight of God, and that alone, in and of itself, is sufficient
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   to banish once and forever any personal thoughts, or any sense of personal popularity. But we
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   have seen that in doing this, the apostle gives us some other great and mighty reasons
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   for preaching in this particular way and manner. He uses no tricks, he does not adulterate
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   the word of God, he gives it as it is, allows it as it were to speak for itself. And we
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   have been praising these great and wonderful reasons which he gives usâ€”the glory of Christ,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   the glory of God, this extraordinary thing that is worked by the gospel when God shines
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   into the heart, as he did in the creation at the beginning, and indeed our own desperate
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   need and condition. Now, there are some of the reasons, but we
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   come this evening to another reason, and in many ways it is the last and the final reason
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   that he gives us, and that is the power that is inherent in the gospel and is part and
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   parcel of it. We have this treasure, he says, and the treasure is the gift of ministry that
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   has been given to him. He says he is like a man handling a treasure. He has more or
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   less said that already in talking about handling the word of God, but now he refers to his
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   whole ministry, his calling and everything that he does. We have this treasure. He is
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   like a man who is carrying and who is handling and looking after a treasure. He is a custodian,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   he is a guardian of it. These are the terms that he uses elsewhere. He is a steward of
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   the mysteries. Very well. Now, he says we have this treasure in earthen vessels, by
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   which he means not so much physical infirmity. That is included clearly, as the rest of the
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   chapter shows us, but it is not the main stress and emphasis. What he means is human inadequacy.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Man at his best is but an earthen vessel when he considers the character and the nature
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   of this treasure which is put into his hands. We are but earthen vessels, says Paul, full
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   of frailty and of infirmity, full of many defects, earthen broken vessels. But, he says,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   this is quite deliberate. We have this treasure in earthen vessels in order that the excellency
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   of the power may be of God and not of us. Very well, then, here is an additional reason
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   why he preached as he did, because of the excellency of the power.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Now, this is a point which is made very frequently by the apostle, by this apostle in particular.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It is there in the writings of all the others also, but it is much more explicit here in
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   his writings than perhaps in any other. Take, for instance, how he reminds the Romans at
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   the very beginning of his letter to them, he says, I am not ashamed of the gospel of
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Christ. Why not? Well, here is his answer. It is the power of God and to salvation to
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   every one of the believers. That is why. That is why he is so proud of it. It is not his,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   it is not human, it is God, the power of God and to salvation.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   There were many men talking about power in those days, as there still are. The emperors
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and others were talking about power. The military men were talking about power. He says, the
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   apostle, I am preeminent over them all. I have got a power to talk about that they do
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   not understand, they cannot even conceive of, the power of God himself and to salvation.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Let us repeat that. In this age there talks so much about power and bursts so much of
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   powers that it has discovered and has released in the atom. Shattering power, I agree. But
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I am here tonight to talk about an infinitely greater power, the God of the atom and who
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   has put this tremendous explosive power in the atom in that extraordinary manner, the
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   power of God himself and to salvation. The excellency of the power is of God and not
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   of us. And then in writing to these selfsame Corinthians in his first epistle in the fourth
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   chapter he says, the kingdom of God is not in word but in power. There were some people
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   criticizing this great apostle in Corinth and saying very big things to one another
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   and against Paul. And Paul says, I am going to visit you and I am going to test these
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   people. And he says, the test I am going to apply is not their words, I am going to test
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   their power. The kingdom of God is not in word but in power. There it is again, exactly
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   the same concept. He writes to the Thessalonians and he says it there again, our gospel came
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   not unto you in word only but in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance. That's
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   it. And then he puts it negatively in writing to Timothy in the second epistle, third chapter,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   verse five he says, there are certain people who have a form of godliness but deny the
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   power thereof. This is his great word you see, this tremendous power of God. Well now
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   then the apostle is adverting to the same thing here and this is what he says. He says
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   this is why I have renounced the hidden things of darkness. I have nothing to do about walking
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   in craftiness, not handling the word of God deceitfully. Why not? Why does he avoid all
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   that? Why isn't he interested in himself and self-display and popularity and things
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   of that kind? Well he says his answer is this, my power would never be enough. The condition
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   of men in sin is such that no human power can touch it. It's so utterly hopeless. It's
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   like that which we read of at the beginning without form and void. Darkness, abyss, and
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   the word of a man is useless. So says the apostle I was not foolish enough to attempt
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   it. He's already said all this of course in the first epistle in the second chapter.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   When I came unto you brethren he said, I came not unto you with excellency of speech or
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   wisdom. That isn't the way he came. He determined not to know anything among them except Jesus
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Christ and him crucified. And my speech and my preaching he said was not with enticing
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   words of men's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. Now it's the same
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   thing you see everywhere. That's the great thing that he is concerned about and that
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   he goes on repeating, that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   power of God. Now here I say is a very important point. He doesn't do these things that these
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   false apostles were doing because he realizes it's all quite useless. But secondly, there's
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   no need for him to try to do it himself because God's power is on it and it's in it. In demonstration
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   of the Spirit and of power. The Spirit is upon the word. Sure men would be a fool who
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   try to add his little power to that. Like a foolish man trying to strike a match to
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   help the light of the sun. Multiply that by infinity and there you see the folly of a
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   man trying as these others with whom Paul contrasts himself were doing to present this
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   message. And indeed there's a third reason and it's this. The apostles' one great fear
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   was that he in any shape or form should come between the people and this power. That he
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   should in any way obtrude himself or be a hindrance or cast any shadow upon it. So for
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   all these reasons he tells them. He behaves and conducts himself and preaches in the way
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   that he indicates. Well now then this is the point that we therefore are concerned about
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   this evening. Let me put it like this. The gospel of Jesus Christ my friend is a power.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   It's not just a proposal. It's not just a philosophy. It's not just a teaching. There
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   it is you see. We're not ashamed of the gospel of Christ why it is the power of God. We preach
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Christ crucified. Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. It's a power not a
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   proposal. And this is a very essential part of this gospel and so many misunderstand it
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   and are not Christian because they've never realized it. This gospel does things. It doesn't
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   merely put itself before us like other theories and ideas do. Political, sociological, philosophical
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   etc. No no. This is a power. This is God's way of doing things. He does things through
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   the preaching of the word. That is his ordained method through this word. This indeed if you
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   like is the way in which God does what we were talking about last Sunday night. We were
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   putting our emphasis upon God who commended the light to shine out of darkness hath shine.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Well now this is how God does the shining. That's what the apostle is telling us about.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   He does it through this power and it is of course the power of the Holy Spirit. Now Christianity
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   cannot be understood apart from this. From this doctrine of the Holy Spirit's work and
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   activity. You see it's like this. This is the wonderful thing about this great salvation
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   that the apostle is outlining here. The Father, God the Father planned it and conceived it
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   in eternity. He sent his only begotten son to work out the plan in time. That's why he
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   was born as a baby in Bethlehem in the fullness of the times. That's why he taught. That's
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   why he died upon the cross. That's why he rose again. What's he doing? Well he's bringing
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   to pass God's great way of saving men and he's finished the work. But then the Holy
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Spirit comes. And what is his business? Well his work, his business, his task is to apply
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   what has been accomplished by the Son unto men and women. That's his great work. He mediates
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   it. He applies it. He brings it to us and he does it in a very powerful manner. So that
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   we don't understand this Christian gospel unless we see the part by the Father, the
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Son, and by the Holy Ghost. We've spent an evening in considering the glory of the Father.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Light of the knowledge of the glory of God. That's the Father. Yes, but we've also spent
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   a night in considering the glory of the Son, lest the light of the gospel of the glory
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   of Christ should shine unto them. And this is absolutely right. The glory of the Father,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   the glory of the Son, but don't forget the glory of the Holy Spirit, the glory of the
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Holy Ghost. Now then, that is what we are concerned about this evening and it's a very
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   vital subject. The New Testament is very concerned about this, isn't it? There are solemn warnings
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   in the New Testament against grieving the Holy Spirit. There are solemn warnings in
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   the New Testament against quenching the Holy Spirit. What does that mean? Well, that means
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   this, that in a meeting such as this, when the Holy Spirit is present, that you do anything
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   to quench his activity and his power, to hold it back. Yes, there are solemn warnings in
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   the New Testament against resisting the Holy Spirit. Do you remember the sermon preached
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   by the martyr Stephen? He gives a review of the story of the children of Israel and he
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   turns to his contemporary fellow Jews and he says, "You are repeating exactly what has
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   been done throughout the centuries. You are stiff-necked, you are hard-hearted. You do
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   always resist the Spirit, even as your fathers did. It's a terrible thing." Now, my friends,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   the Holy Spirit is in this meeting. And there are men and women who go to their graves not
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   knowing the glory of God and of Christ because they have resisted or have quenched the Holy
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Spirit. They have felt his power, but they have done their utmost to shake him off. They
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   have disliked being made uncomfortable. They said, "I'm being carried away," and they have
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   resisted. And according to this teaching, to resist the Holy Spirit is the most terrible
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   thing that a soul can ever do. When you feel conviction, don't resist it, my friend. Give
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   in, give way, let him lead you on. Don't fight, don't hold back, don't be governed by your
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   prejudices, don't feel that you're going to be laughed at by people, what's it matter?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   All that is to resist the Spirit. Let him do his blessed work. Indeed, our Lord himself
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   said this, remember, that all sins are forgiven to men except this sin against the Holy Ghost.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   He said, "A man who blasphemes against the Son, it shall be forgiven him. But whosoever
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   neither in the world to come." What does that mean? It means this. It means this resistance
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   of the power of the Holy Spirit as he deals with us and brings God's Word to us. It means,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   as those very people were doing in the presence of Christ, attributing his work to Belial,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   the prince of the devils, to say there was nothing in it, to laugh at it and to ridicule
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   it. That is to blaspheme the Holy Ghost. And there is no forgiveness for that, either in
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   this world or in the world to come. Very well then, you see, the Scripture is full of these
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   solemn warnings against this resisting, or trying to quench the Holy Spirit, not recognizing
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   the excellency of the power, the glory of the Holy Spirit in the work of salvation.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Now the apostle, as I say, is saying all this here. That is why he has renounced the hidden
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   things of dishonesty and does not walk in craftiness, neither handles the Word of God
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   beseechingly. That is to sin against the Holy Ghost. And it is not a folly, for his is the
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   power. The excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Now then, what does all this mean? Well, let me put it to you as simply as I can in the
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   form of some three propositions. Here is my first. The manifestation of this power of
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   the Holy Spirit is a proof, and an absolute proof, of the divine nature and character
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   of Christianity. Had you ever thought of that? Now the apostle says this is deliberate. We
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   are given this treasure in earthen vessels in order that the excellency of the power
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   might be of God and not of us. In other words, he says, God has done this in such a way that
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   anybody rarely looking at this intelligently can see at once that it is not man, but that
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   it is God. The vessel is too weak to explain it. It is the treasure that is inside. It
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   is the excellency of the power that is of God. Now I say that that is a proof of the
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   divine origin and nature and character of Christianity. Let me show you what I mean.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   And this is the great paradox of Christianity, so-called. Look at it in the case of our Lord
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   himself. Look at that phenomenon. Look at that little babe in the manger. Looks like
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   an ordinary babe like every other, and yet there is something different. In other words,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   it is not the mere arrival of a babe. That is not the only thing that has happened here.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   There is something more here. There is a glory here. The shepherds hear the singing of the
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   angels, and they come, they have had a message. Go to the city of Bethlehem. Something has
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   happened there. Savior, which is Christ the Lord, go and see him. And they said, let's
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   go and see. They saw nothing but a babe, yes, but he was the Savior of the world. Wise men
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   come. What is this? You cannot explain it. Just an ordinary child and a very poor one
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   at that. They could not afford anything more than two turtle doves when they had to give
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   up their suffering. So poor, so lowly, so humble, born in a stable. Then follow him
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   along. He worked as a carpenter. He never went to the training places of the Pharisees,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   never sat at the feet of Gamaliel or Hillel or any one of them. No training, no learning,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   no knowledge. And yet, you see, he constantly is amazing and astounding people. There is
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   something inexplicable about him. He is a root out of dry ground. He appears to be a
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   mere nobody in his birth, in everything, all the circumstances attendant, in the lack
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   of training, and all the rest of it. And yet, you see, he stands up and there has never
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   been anybody like him. What is it all due to? Well, we are told what it is due to. It
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   was something that happened to him when he was baptized in the Jordan by John the Baptist.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   The Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove and filled him with power.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   He was sealed by the Spirit. So when he goes back to his hometown of Nazareth and enters
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   the synagogue on the Sunday and they hand him the scroll and he reads out of the book
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   of the prophet Isaiah, he says, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your sight.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, hath anointed me to preach the gospel." He has been anointed.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   He has been given this power by the Holy Ghost. He has received the Spirit without measure.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   The Spirit of God is empowering him. He, you see, though he is still the Son of God, had
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   taken on him human nature, he decides to live as a man in this world. And so he is dependent
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   upon the power that is given to him. And so he begins to reveal his learning and his knowledge
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   and his understanding. And they couldn't understand him. They said, "How is this man learning
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   never having learned? Who is this man who can bend the words and put back the authorities
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   and the powers? Who is he who says, 'I say unto you'? What is all this?" Well, you see,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   this is the enigma, isn't it? You can't explain it in terms of Jesus of Nazareth. You can't
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   explain it in human terms only. No, no. The excellency of the power is above. It's of
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   God. It isn't only man. It's this other element. Great is the mystery of godliness. God was
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   manifest in the flesh and so on. And you remember what happens when he works his miracles. We
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   are told so often after he'd worked a miracle that the people glorified God. They said,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   "We have seen strange things today. They marveled at the mighty power of God in a man." And
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   he said it himself explicitly, "I can do nothing of myself. The Father that sent me, he doeth
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   the works." He says he's utterly dependent upon the Father for his words, for his works,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   for his power, for everything. He's made himself of no reputation. He's taken the form of a
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   servant. And then, you see, that is the explanation, that though he's living as a man, there is
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   this mighty supernatural power. The excellency of the power was of God and not of men.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   But let's have a look at the apostles and there perhaps you see it still more clearly.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Here's a phenomenon. You remember that when the authorities arrested Peter and John and
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   arraigned them before their tribunal, they admitted that they'd got a problem. They said
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   these men are obviously unlearned and ignorant men. And yet they said it is a fact after
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   all that a very notable miracle has been worked by them and all the people know it and we
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   can't dispute it. But here was the problem. Ignorant and unlearned men. And yet they've
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   worked this mighty miracle. How do you explain that? But that isn't the only thing you've
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   got to explain. Take these apostles. Look at them just before the crucifixion. Look at
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   them just after the crucifixion. Crestfallen, disappointed, disconsolate, cast down, feeling
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   utterly hopeless. Then look at this man Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost, speaking
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and preaching like a lion. What's happened? Ah, you see what's happened is that which
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   took place on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit was shed forth upon them and they
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   were all filled with the Spirit. The excellency of the power is of God and not of us. Look
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   at the understanding that they were given. They were unable to understand the scriptures
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   which they hadn't understood before. They were unable to preach with great authority
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   and power. We are constantly being told this in various places in the book of the Acts
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   of the Apostles and because it's emphasized there it's my duty to emphasize it to you
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   this evening. This is the kind of thing you read, for instance, in Acts 4, 8. Here are
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Peter and John before this great gathering, this great council of priests and captain
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   of the temple and Sadducees and so on. And they're being charged and they're being threatened,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   but this is what I read. "Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   of the people and elders of Israel, if we this day be examined to the good deed done
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   to the impotent men, by what means he is made whole, be it made known unto you and to all
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you all."
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   What a bold address. Yes, but remember it's the men who a few weeks before were so frightened
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   and craven-hearted that he denied Christ to the serving maid in order to save his life.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   But here he is speaking like a lion. Listen to him again in the 33rd verse of the same
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   chapter. "And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Christ, and great grace was upon them all." And you'll read exactly the same thing about
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   the apostle Paul. It isn't confined to the apostle Peter. Listen to this about Paul in
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Acts 39. "Then Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes upon
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   him." Who's he addressing? Well, he's addressing a very important man. He is in the presence
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   of Sergius Paulus, a prudent man, the governor of a certain district, who'd got Elemas the
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   sorcerer with him, a man with great power. "But Saul, filled with the Holy Ghost, set
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   his eyes upon him and said, 'O fool of all subtlety and all mischief, thou child of the
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   the world?'" Look at the boldness. And it's the same with all of them. They were able
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   to understand, to expound, to preach, to speak with great authority. And what did it lead
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   to? Well, you remember that it led to the change which took place in 3,000 people on
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   the day of Pentecost, and to many others. Now this is a part of the same thing. You
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   can't explain this in terms of men. They're the same men, the same ordinary, unlearned
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   and ignorant men. And yet they're transformed, and they're transfigured in knowledge, in
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   power, in understanding, in everything. And there's only one explanation. They are but
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   earthen vessels. And we must believe that it was done deliberately, that the Almighty
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   God and his Son left this treasure of the Gospel not in the hands of Greek philosophers
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   or Roman statesmen, but in the hands of fishermen, ordinary workmen and artisans. Why? Well,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   that it might be obvious to everybody that the excellency of the power is of God, not
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   of men. You simply can't explain it in those terms. And then think of the converts. Look
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   at them. Here is Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost. Seems to be quoting Old Testament
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   scriptures. And yet suddenly as he preaches, people began to cry out, saying, "Men and
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   brethren, what shall we do?" What is this? Is it just quoting scripture? Is it just the
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   words of this fisherman? Of course it isn't. It is that he was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   It is this power, I say. It is this activity of God himself through his Word, convicting,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   bringing them to this state, alarming them, and causing them to cry out, saying, "Men
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   and brethren, what shall we do?" You remember the first convert that the Apostle Paul saw
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   as the result of his preaching the Gospel for the first time in this continent of Europe
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   in which we live, was a woman called Lydia. And how did she become a convert? Well, the
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Word tells us, "Whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things that were
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   spoken of Paul." Lydia, the Spirit, opened her heart, opened her understanding. Look
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   at the jailer. He again is the same. "Sirs, what must I do to be saved? What's the matter
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   with this man?" "Ah, you say it was the earthquake." Of course it wasn't. There were frequently
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   earthquakes in those districts. And he had been assured that all was well. But why does
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   he cry out? "What must I do to be saved? What is this?" Oh, it's the same power, this conviction.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Now, this is Christianity, you see. It isn't a man just deciding to live a better life.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   It isn't a man just deciding to take up the Christian philosophy, or to take the Christian
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   point of view on war and peace and so on. No, no. It's a man coming under the power.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   The excellency of the power is of God and not of men. And, of course, this has been
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   equally evident throughout the running centuries, and in all the subsequent history of the Christian
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   church. My point is, you see, that the manifestation of this power is a proof of the divine origin
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   of Christianity. Can't you see it? Can't you see that there would never have been Christianity
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   at all but for this? These men were disconsolate, they were hopeless, until they didn't understand.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   But then they did, and then they went on. And look at the subsequent history. Look at
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   the growth of the Christian church. Have you ever thought of that? Ignorant and unlearned
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   men, only a handful altogether, about 120. What hope have they got? In a pagan world,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   in a Jewish world, utterly hopeless it seems to be. And yet, you see, it grew and developed,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   it began to be talked about quite soon as this which turns the world upside down. These
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   men which are turning the world upside down are come hither, they said. Within three centuries,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   it had become the official religion of the Roman Empire. What is this? How do you explain
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   it all? You see, what you've got to explain is this. On the one hand, you've got the Jewish
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   religion, temple in Jerusalem, the great traditions of the past. It was all against Christianity.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   It was the Jews themselves who rejected and crucified their own Messiah. Their leaders,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   the Pharisees, Sadducees, and scribes incited the people, and the people listened. They
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   were all against it, and they were a very powerful lot of men. But you see, it wasn't
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   only Judaism. The whole might of the Roman Empire was against it. The teaching of the
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Roman Empire at that time was that Caesar is Lord. Caesar had been turned into a god,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   and he demanded worship and a totalitarian allegiance. The whole might and machinery
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   of the great and mighty Roman Empire was against this, and was trying to crush it and to quell
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   it and to exterminate it. Not only that, the whole of Greek philosophy was against it,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   and that was a mighty and an imposing system. The human mind has never reached a greater
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   height possibly than it did in that flowering period of Greek philosophy. The masters had
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   just begun and had taught and had established their schools, and it was all against this.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   For the Greeks, foolishness, nonsense, ridiculous. An unknown carpenter, the Savior? The Jews,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   the means of salvation? The thing was monstrous. All the brilliance and the knowledge and the
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   logic and the argumentation of Greece, it was all against it. In other words, Christianity
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   was not confronting an illiterate mob or mass of people. It was confronting the most civilizing
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   and perhaps the greatest powers that this world has ever known. All that was against
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   it. That's one side, but look at the other. Look at the Christians themselves. What sort
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   of people were they? Well, not only is it true to say that the very leaders themselves
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   were these ordinary, ignorant, and unlearned men. I'm excluding the Apostle Paul at this
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   point, but it started with the others before he ever came into it. But you see, that's
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   not the only truth. The New Testament itself is a very honest book, and it gives us an
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   honest, unvarnished picture of Christian churches and of Christian men and women. And sometimes
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   you come to the conclusion that they're a very poor lot, quarreling in the church at
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Corinth, jealousy and envy, despising one another, some of them still guilty of the
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   old sins which they'd committed before. Reread the first epistle to the Corinthians. See
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   it for yourself. Look how easily they could be led astray. Look at the heresies that they
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   were ready to swallow. Look at the way they'd follow the latest teacher who came along and
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   believe him and run after him. Oh, it's a heartbreaking picture very often. Oh, no,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   it's a very wonderful picture, this. It's just a proof of my text tonight. We have this
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And it's been like that ever since. Throughout the running centuries, look at the Christian
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   church, look at it even today. Have you been reading your newspapers this last week? It's
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   in spite of that that it's gone on. If the church were a human institution, she would
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   have finished years, centuries ago. Hopeless earthen vessels. Oh, says somebody, I don't
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   understand that. Of course you don't. But you see, that's God's paradox. This treasure
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   is in earthen vessels. Nobody can say that it's men who've kept the Christian church
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   going. They've compromised on every single truth. They've denied all of them between
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   them at some time or another. They've broken it all down in practice. They couldn't conceivably
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   have made a greater mess of the church than they've done. And yet in spite of that, she's
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   gone on. And there's only one explanation. The excellency of the power is of God and
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   not of men. The thing is as plain as daylight. How can anybody miss it? If this were but
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   a human institution preaching a human philosophy, it wouldn't have been heard of. Centuries
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   ago it would have gone. But it's gone on and it's going on. Why? Well, you see, you have
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   the great phenomenon of what are called revivals. And what are they? Oh, it's this. Men between
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   them have almost brought the church to an end. The Roman Catholic church practically
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   did that in the Middle Ages. Almost quenched the spirit finally. Almost destroyed the gospel
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   altogether, kept everybody in ignorance, lived an immoral, dissolute life, many of their
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   leaders even including their popes. And everything seemed to be finished. But suddenly, one man
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   called Martin Luther gets up and stands alone. He says, "I can do no other, so help me God."
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   And he stood one man alone against the might of that great organization, the Roman church,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   and centuries of tradition. And he shook it to its foundations. What's the explanation?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Is this Martin Luther? Well, you know, he must have been a colossus if it was, but it
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   wasn't Martin Luther. He was but an unearthed vessel. He was a very frail man and a very
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   fallible man and a man who had many faults and weaknesses and defects. But it was this.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   It was the excellency of the power that was of God and not of Martin Luther. He was but
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   the instrument and the channel and God used him with this mighty power to shake and to
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   shake and reformation came in and a new life in the church. And that has happened in every
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   reformation and revival that the church has ever known.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   You see, this is just history, my friends. And what I am deducing is this, that all this
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   is but a proof of the fact that Christianity is of God and not of men, that it's a power
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and an activity and not mere proposal and philosophy. Let me make another point, which
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   is this. The manifestation of this power divides men into two groups. If our gospel be heard,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   it is heard to them that are lost. That's one group. But there's another group, those
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   to whom it is not heard, those who are saved. And as certainly as we are in this chapel
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   this morning, this evening, there are only two groups of people in this world, the lost
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and the saved, those to whom all this is hid, those to whom this is everything and who've
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   seen it. That brings me to my last point, which I do want to emphasize above everything,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   which is this. I'm putting it in the form of a question. Have you known this power?
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   The excellency of the power is of God, not of us. The gospel is a power. It is a teaching,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   but not only a teaching. It's a power, the power of God unto salvation, the excellency
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   of the power. My dear friend, if you've not known this gospel as a power, you don't
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   know it. If you think this is something that you can take up, you've got it the wrong
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   way around. It's something that takes you up. The Apostle Paul says that he was apprehended
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   on the road to Damascus, so he was. Everybody who becomes a Christian is apprehended. It
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   is the excellency of the power, which is of God and not of us. So the one vital question
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   for us this evening is this, which of the two groups do we belong to? Have you known
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   anything of this power? Has the gospel of Jesus Christ come to you as the power of God?
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Well, let me tell you some simple tests which you can apply to yourself here and now and
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   make sure of it once and forever. Here are some of the tests.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Once a man feels and comes under this power, these things become his chief concern. That's
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   the first thing that happens. Until a man feels this power, this excellent, glorious
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   power of God, he lives perhaps for the things, well, in some shape or form, for the things
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   of this world, perhaps pleasure, notoriety, wealth, money, position, food, drink, sex,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   the usual things that people live for. And those are his everything. They're at the center
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   of his life. And he never thinks of anything else. Never thinks about his soul. Never starts
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   to think about his relationship to God. Never thinks about dying. Oh, he may protest tremendously
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   against people being killed by bombs, but he never thinks about his own death. Never.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   That thinks political, you see. But he never thinks of his own death. Doesn't like these
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   thoughts. Seem morbid, introspective, narrow. Doesn't like them.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   But the moment a man begins to feel something of this excellent power, these things become
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   everything to him. His soul, everything else recedes into insignificance. His career, his
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   wife, his children, his possessions, his everything. Yes, everything goes back. This is everything.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   He's a living soul. He's facing God. And what about this soul?
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Is your soul your main concern? That's the first question. Finally, what shall it profit
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   a man, though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Can you say honestly that
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   your soul is your greatest concern? If not, you know nothing about this gospel. I don't
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   care how good you are. I don't care how moral. I don't care how much good you do. It doesn't
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   matter at all. If your soul is not your first great concern, you've never known this power.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   It always brings a man to consider this. But of course, it's not a mere consideration
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   of the soul. This power brings a man to realize the state of his soul and that it's lost and
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   that it's perishing. Yes, says the apostle, if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   are lost. And a man begins to realize that he is lost. What does that mean? Well, it
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   means this. He realizes that he doesn't know God, that he's ignorant of the glory of God.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   God has just been a term to him, like any other term in philosophy, God, Christ. But
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   he doesn't know God. He has no knowledge. Knowledge in this intimate personal sense
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   is just a man and is no more. And he then begins to grieve about this. He desires to
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   know God. He begins to seek Him. He says with Job, "Oh, that I knew where I might find
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Him." He tries to give up sin, live a better life, read his Bible, tries to pray. But he
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   can't find God. And he becomes alarmed. He wants to find God. He wants to know God.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   But he can't find Him. And then he realizes that he can't because he's sinful. He had
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   a fairly good conceit of himself before, if he ever thought about himself. But now he
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   begins to see the darkness of his own soul. He begins to see that there's vileness and
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   blackness within him, that there's a rottenness at the very center, that he loves evil, loves
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   darkness, and hates the light. Instead of loving the light and hating the darkness,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   he begins to realize that he's outside God, unlike the saints of the Scriptures and the
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   saints he reads about in the history of the church. He can do nothing. He's a lost soul.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   He doesn't know how to die. He doesn't know what's facing him beyond death, except that
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   it's all blank and black and uncertain. That always happens to a man who begins to feel
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   this power, this excellent power. But you see, it doesn't stop there either. At this
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   point, as I say, he's looking for light, trying to find it here and there. Perhaps he goes
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   around to the cults, he reads books, tries to understand philosophy. He's seeking. But
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   as the power continues upon him, he soon stops all that. And he begins to realize that all
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   his seeking will never bring him to finding. He realizes that all the wisdom of the world
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   has never found God and never has known Christ, has never found deliverance from the chains
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   of sin and evil. He gives it all up. He stops. He acknowledges that he's a complete failure,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   that he's utterly helpless, that he's completely hopeless. He realizes that the great brain
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   of which he's bursted so much is as useless here as the brain of a gnat. He stops talking
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   about his understanding. He stops seeking human wisdom and knowledge and philosophy
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   and understanding. He says it's all no good. He says to himself, "There's only one thing
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   to do. I must do what the Lord Jesus Christ told men that they'd all got to do." He said,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   "Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   kingdom of God." And this man says, "I'm a little child. I can't. Nobody else can. There's
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   only one thing to do. I go to him and to him alone. Christ! I'm shut up to the Bible. I'm
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   shut up to Christ. There's nothing. There's nobody else. Christ! And Christ alone!" He
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   comes to that. In his desperation, he's admitted his sin, he's admitted his failure, he's admitted
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   his hopelessness. He's even ceased to try. He casts himself as he is in utter hopelessness
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   and despair. He cries out with the men in Acts 2, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   The answer comes back, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and he doth so." Like a little
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   child, abandoning everything else, trusting himself and in the whole world. And as a little
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   child, he turns to the Lord Jesus Christ. And he finds in him what the Apostle Paul
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   finds in him, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption. The all in all, everything,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   alpha, omega, beginning, end. What? What am I talking about? Wisdom, understanding of
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   himself, life, death, God, everything. It's all here. It's all in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   So he stops looking in any direction but only unto him. And he says, "Yes, here I see it,
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   man made in the image of God, failing, damned, lost, God, sending his own Son in the likeness
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   of sinful flesh and for sin. Jesus, Son of God, come down to earth." What for? "To
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   bear my sins in his own body on the tree, his body to be broken, his blood to be shed."
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   What for? "To receive the punishment of my sin. He's made himself an offering for my
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   sin. God is dealing with my sin in him and offering me free pardon and forgiveness."
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Wisdom, righteousness. But oh, how to get rid of the power of sin that is within me.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   Well, to be linked to Christ, sanctification, final redemption, to be in him and he in me,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   the gift of the Spirit, this power, the excellency of the power. "Work out your own salvation
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   in fear and trembling." Why? "For it is God that worketh in you, God that worketh in you,
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   not left to yourself any longer, the power of God in you, urging you on, leading you
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   on. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God that worketh
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   in us, both to will and to do, of his good pleasure." Have you come to that? Are you
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   looking anywhere tonight except at Christ? Do you still believe the philosophers can
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   lead you to truth? Are you still putting your faith in politics and statesmen? Are you trusting
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   to education and knowledge? Are you trusting to your morality and your own willpower? If
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   you are, you're lost. But if you've seen the utter uselessness of it all, then you're looking
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   only unto the Lord Jesus Christ. It is because this excellent power has been working on you,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   enlightening you, opening your eyes, giving you understanding, leading you into the truth.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Have you come there? Is Jesus Christ to you tonight, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   and redemption? I can easily test you by my last question, which is this. Are you following
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   him? Have you given up the life of sin and of the world? Has he made you turn round?
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Are you going after him? Have you denied yourself and taken up your cross? Are you following
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   him, I ask? How has it affected your life? You know, my friend, you can say, "I believe
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   in the Lord Jesus Christ," and it can be useless. If it hasn't made any difference to your life
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   and living, it's of no value. That's a false believism. I am asking, have you felt the
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   power which changes your life, makes you turn from sin and evil and the world, and go after
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Christ, cost what it may? Tell me, are you more interested in this than in anything else?
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   I want to put it simply and plainly and bluntly. Young men, are you more concerned about this
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   than you are about your future career? Young women, are you more concerned about this than
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   about getting married? If Christ isn't first with you, he's nowhere. He must be first.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Look at this man, Paul, this proud Pharisee that he was, who hated it all and blasphemed
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   it all. Here he is preaching it, glorying in it. Why? Well, the glory of Christ leading
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   to the glory of God. Is he to you glorious? If he is, you know, you'll give your life
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   to him, you'll give yourself to him, you'll desire nothing comparable to knowing him,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   you'll rejoice in him, you'll live for him. He'll be everything to you. Is he? Can you
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   say honestly, Jesus, I, my cross, have taken all to leave and follow thee? Destitute, despised,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   forsaken, thou from hence my all shalt be. Perish every fond ambition, all I've hoped
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   and thought and known, yet how rich is my condition. God and Christ are all I know.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   Have you known this power? That's the thing that matters, the excellency of the power.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   I can paint pictures and perhaps make you admire Christ, that's not what I'm asking.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   I'm asking, have you felt the power that makes you see the glory and makes you see that nothing
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   matters except your knowledge of him and your relationship to him? Is he your Lord? Does
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   he engage your love and affection? Are you ready, if called upon, to forsake everything?
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   For him who loved you and died for you gave his all that you might be forgiven, that you
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   might become a child of God. When this excellent power of the Holy Spirit works, that's what
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   it does. He convicts, he converts, he leads to Christ, he establishes in the truth. And
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   he goes on perfecting the work until finally beyond this life we shall be glorious and
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   perfect and entire, children of God and like Christ in the everlasting glory. We have this
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power might be of God, not of us. I
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   can't make you a Christian, nobody can, he alone can. Have you felt the power? Test yourself.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   Are you looking only unto him and like a little child, leaving yourself entirely to him and
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   in his hand? Amen.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
