[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.440]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.680]   This podcast is separate
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.080]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.440]   Before we begin today,
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.640]   just want to acknowledge that
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.000]   if you're watching this on YouTube,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   yes, I have a bandage on the left side of my face.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.360]   I was trying to cook something for Costello and I,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.400]   and I got burned, burned myself.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.460]   It was a cooking accident.
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.300]   I'm fine.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.160]   No need to dwell on it.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.040]   We can move on.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.160]   But I just wanted to let you know,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.200]   everybody's going to be okay.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.280]   He got a great meal.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.060]   I got a burn and a great meal.
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.920]   Today, we're going to be talking about hormone optimization,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.720]   and we're mainly going to be focusing
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.640]   on estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.360]   Now, estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.720]   are what we call sex steroids.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.760]   But I just want to emphasize that estrogen and testosterone
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.500]   are present in everybody.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.440]   It's their ratios that determine their effects.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.740]   So today, we're going to talk about
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.960]   how specific types of exercise,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.200]   particular patterns of cold exposure,
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.260]   as well as particular patterns, believe it or not,
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.080]   of breathing can impact sex steroid hormones,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.080]   both estrogen and testosterone.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.020]   So one of the first things to understand
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.200]   if you want to optimize your hormones
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.980]   is where they come from.
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.720]   There are a lot of different glands in the body
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.920]   that produce hormones.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.920]   But when we're talking about the sex steroid hormones,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.240]   estrogen and testosterone,
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.480]   the major sources are ovaries for estrogen
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.100]   and the testes for testosterone,
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.880]   although the adrenals can also make testosterone.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.160]   Now, there are also some enzymes.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.520]   Enzymes are things that can change chemical composition.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.600]   And the enzymes that we're going to talk about today
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.680]   are the aromatases mainly.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.240]   The aromatases convert testosterone into estrogen.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.120]   So in a male, for instance, that has very high testosterone,
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.880]   some of that is going to be converted
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.800]   into estrogen by aromatase.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.640]   The important thing to know is that prepubescent females
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.400]   make very little estrogen.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.400]   And when we talk about estrogen,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.080]   we mainly talk about estradiol,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.280]   which is the most active form of estrogen
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.060]   in both males and females.
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.600]   So prepubescent females, very low levels of estrogen.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.960]   During puberty, levels of estrogen, aka estradiol,
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.480]   basically skyrocket.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.960]   And then across the lifespan,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.120]   estrogen is going to vary
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.060]   depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle,
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.920]   but as one heads into menopause,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.800]   which typically takes place nowadays
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.560]   somewhere between age 45 and 60,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.060]   levels of estrogen are going to drop.
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.860]   And then post-menopause levels of estrogen are very low.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.600]   As well, testosterone will fluctuate across the lifespan.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.960]   Testosterone is going to be relatively low
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.080]   pre-puberty in males.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.600]   During puberty, it's going to skyrocket.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.920]   And then the current numbers are that it drops off
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.600]   at about a rate of 1% per year.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.980]   So let's talk about other sources of these hormones,
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.300]   and then it will make clear what avenues
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.600]   you might want to take in order to optimize these hormones.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.740]   The other glands and tissues in the body
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.680]   that make these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.900]   as I mentioned briefly, are the adrenals.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.180]   So the adrenals ride up top the kidneys,
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.260]   and the release of these steroid hormones from the adrenals,
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.540]   in particular testosterone
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.340]   and some of its related derivatives,
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.120]   are mainly activated by competition.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.280]   Pretty interesting.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.760]   There's a lot of evidence in animals and humans
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.400]   that competitive scenarios,
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.480]   at least short-lived competitive scenarios,
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.920]   can liberate testosterone from the adrenals.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.960]   So let's talk about competition,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.560]   because it turns out that competition
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.040]   is a powerful influence on the sex steroid hormones,
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.760]   and the sex steroid hormones powerfully influence
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.240]   competition.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.680]   So most people don't realize this,
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.620]   but most males of a given mammalian species
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.920]   never get to reproduce.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.960]   In fact, they never even get to have sex at all.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.640]   And we don't often think about that,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.980]   but testosterone plays a powerful role
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.400]   in determining which members of a given species
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.720]   will get to reproduce,
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.880]   which ones of that species
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.520]   will actually get access to females.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.680]   And so here I'm not talking about humans specifically,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.240]   but it's well-known in species like elephant seals,
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.040]   in species like antlered animals and rams, for instance,
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.880]   that the higher levels of testosterone
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.340]   correlate with access to females.
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.520]   Now, one interpretation of this
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.780]   is that the females are detecting
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.400]   which males have high testosterone and selecting them.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.600]   They're more receptive to them.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.580]   But it's actually more so
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.120]   that the males that have higher testosterone
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.880]   forage further and will fight harder for the females.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.160]   And this is really interesting
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.080]   because there's very good evidence now
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.640]   that testosterone can reduce anxiety,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.560]   promote novelty seeking,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.960]   and promote competitive interactions.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.380]   And so before you leap too far with this in your mind
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.200]   and think about all these human behaviors,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.040]   just stay with me,
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.280]   'cause there's a little bit of biology here
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.600]   that makes it all make sense.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.820]   And it turns out to be pretty simple.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.840]   We have a brain region called the amygdala.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.280]   In Latin, that just means almond,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.840]   but the amygdala is most famous for its role in fear.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.400]   We hear a lot about fear and the amygdala,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.440]   but the amygdala is really involved in threat detection.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.160]   It sets our thresholds for anxiety
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.660]   and what we consider scary or too much.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.280]   Testosterone secreted from the gonads
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.600]   and elsewhere in the body
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.560]   binds to the amygdala
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.400]   and changes the threshold for stress.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.860]   So I've said before on previous versions of this podcast
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.220]   and on other podcasts,
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.920]   that testosterone has this incredible effect
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.640]   of making effort feel good.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.040]   But what I was really referring to
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.280]   is the fact that testosterone lowers stress and anxiety
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.800]   in particular in males of a given species.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.440]   Testosterone increases generally lead to more foraging,
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.160]   more novelty seeking,
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.840]   increases in libido and increases in desire to mate.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.520]   So it is the case that increases in testosterone
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.640]   promote competitive and foraging type behaviors
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.800]   in humans and in non-human mammals.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.840]   But it's also true that competition itself
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.800]   can increase androgens such as testosterone.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.700]   Now, some people have come to the conclusion
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.040]   that if you win, your testosterone goes up
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.020]   and if you lose, your testosterone goes down.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.600]   And to some extent that's true,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.680]   but that's not a direct effect on the gonads.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.460]   That's actually mediated by the neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.160]   We talked about dopamine in the episode
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.000]   on motivation and drive.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.400]   And dopamine and testosterone
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.300]   have a remarkable interplay in the body.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.400]   Dopamine is actually released in the brain
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.600]   in ways that has the pituitary,
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.880]   this gland that sits over the roof of your mouth,
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.880]   release certain hormones that then go on
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.360]   to promote the release of more testosterone.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.120]   And indeed winning promotes more dopamine
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.840]   and later more testosterone.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.740]   However, in the short term,
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.320]   just competing increases testosterone
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.300]   independent of whether or not you win or lose.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.040]   So testosterone is driving the seeking of sex
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.720]   and estrogen is promoting the actual act of sex
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.360]   from female so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   In males, it's interesting to point out
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.600]   that testosterone is promoting seeking of sex,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.880]   but it's also estrogen in males
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.280]   that's important for libido.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.920]   If estrogen levels are brought too low,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.280]   then men will completely lose their libido.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.600]   So it's not simply the case that high levels of testosterone
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.620]   produce a lot of sex and mating behavior
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.900]   and low levels of estrogen are good across the board.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.740]   You actually need both in both males and females.
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.260]   It's just that in females,
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.980]   the testosterone levels are always going to be lower
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.020]   than the estrogen levels.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.800]   And in males, the estrogen levels
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.060]   are always going to be lower than testosterone levels.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.320]   So just as there are behaviors
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.440]   that can increase testosterone,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.700]   there are behaviors that can decrease testosterone.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.460]   And one of the most well-characterized ones in humans
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.200]   is becoming a parent.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   So expecting fathers have an almost 50% decrease
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.080]   in testosterone levels,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.860]   both free and bound testosterone.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.080]   It turns out that these effects of reduced testosterone,
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.440]   increased estradiol and reduced cortisol
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.060]   can all be explained by an increase in prolactin.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.880]   It is a well-known phenomenon
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.520]   that testosterone is going to drop,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.080]   prolactin is going to increase,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.600]   estradiol is going to increase in males and females
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.300]   that are expecting children.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.940]   The other behavior that markedly reduces testosterone
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.480]   in both males and females
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.780]   and markedly reduces the desire for seeking sex
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.740]   and sex itself is illness.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.020]   And many of you might say, well, duh,
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.120]   when people don't feel sick,
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.660]   they don't feel like seeking out mates
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.140]   and they don't feel like having sex.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.660]   But have you ever wondered why that actually is?
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.100]   Well, it turns out that it can be explained
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.280]   by the release of what are called inflammatory cytokines.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.800]   So cytokines are related to the immune system.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.680]   They travel in the lymph and in the blood
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.460]   and they attack invader cells like bacteria and viruses.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.440]   And under conditions of illness,
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.200]   we make a lot of different cytokines.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.180]   Some of them are anti-inflammatory,
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.280]   but some of them are pro-inflammatory.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.400]   And the best known example of a pro-inflammatory cytokine
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.480]   is IL-6.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.740]   And it's known that IL-6 when injected into individuals
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.240]   will decrease the desire for sex
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.880]   and eventually will reduce levels of testosterone
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.120]   and estrogen independent of feeling lousy.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.480]   Now, IL-6 doesn't just travel to the gonads
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.520]   and shut down the gonads.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.160]   It actually has ways to interact with some of the receptors
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.560]   that the steroid hormones, estrogen and testosterone,
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.880]   bind to and impact those receptors
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.620]   so that the sex steroid hormones can't have their effect.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.680]   In short and put simply,
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.920]   inflammatory cytokines like IL-6
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   are bad for sex steroid hormones.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.720]   One of the main behaviors
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.940]   that's been shown to be associated
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.760]   with poor levels of estrogen
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.080]   relative to age match controls for people with ovaries
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.800]   or lower levels of testosterone
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.160]   compared to age match controls for people with testes
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.380]   is apnea.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.880]   So what is apnea?
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.580]   Apnea is under breathing
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.120]   or mainly cessation of breathing during sleep.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.360]   So people are holding their breath
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.200]   and then they'll suddenly wake up.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.420]   People who are dramatically overweight
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.120]   also suffer a lot from apnea during sleep.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.000]   And it's well-established that going into deep sleep
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.080]   and getting the proper patterns of slow wave sleep
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.080]   and REM sleep are important for hormone optimization.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.700]   Breathing itself can be adjusted in the daytime waking hours
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.520]   in ways that can powerfully impact both sleep,
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.740]   reduce incidence of sleep apnea,
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.280]   and also help to optimize various hormones
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.240]   even just by breathing in particular ways while awake.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.320]   Believe it or not,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.480]   being a nasal breather and avoiding being a mouth breather
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.400]   can actually positively impact hormones.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.440]   And in particular, the hormones, testosterone and estrogen.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.680]   Although the way that it does that
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.240]   is by making you a better sleeper,
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.920]   which allows you to produce more testosterone
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.060]   and the appropriate amounts of testosterone and estrogen.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.160]   But it does that in part through indirect mechanisms
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.120]   because deep sleep supports the gonads,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.840]   the ovaries and the testicles
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.560]   and their turnover of cells and the production of cells.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.320]   Remember in the ovary particular cells
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.720]   and the egg follicles themselves make estrogen
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   and in the testicle that the Sertoli cells
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.760]   and the Leydig cells are important
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.320]   for the formation of sperm
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.320]   and for testosterone respectively.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.600]   So what does this all mean?
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.100]   This means we have to be breathing properly
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.700]   to get your breathing and sleep right
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.720]   so that your sleep can actually be deep enough
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.980]   and you're not entering apnea states.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.260]   Getting proper sleep can really offset all the reductions
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.640]   in testosterone and estrogen
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.480]   and reductions in fertility that occur
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.780]   if we don't get enough sleep.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.460]   But seldom is it discussed
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.940]   how sleep actually adjusts things
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.460]   like testosterone and estrogen.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.740]   And it does it by modifying cortisol.
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.820]   So the molecule cholesterol
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.700]   can be converted into testosterone or estrogen
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.760]   but there's a competition
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.260]   whereby the cholesterol will turn into cortisol
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.700]   and not testosterone
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.460]   or it'll turn into cortisol and not estrogen
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.420]   if stress levels are too high.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.960]   So the simple version of this
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.420]   is getting your breathing right during the waking hours
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.620]   meaning primarily unless you're working out really hard
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.520]   or there's some other reason
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.660]   why you're maybe eating or speaking
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.860]   that you need to be breathing through your mouth,
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.380]   you should be a nose breather.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.840]   There's really good evidence for that now.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.740]   And in sleep, you also want to be a nose breather
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.380]   because that's going to increase the amount of oxygen
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.380]   that you're bringing into your system
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.100]   and the amount of carbon dioxide that you're offloading.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.740]   So the simple version of this is get your breathing right.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.580]   So how do you do that?
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.540]   How do you get your breathing right?
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.540]   Well, for some people that have severe sleep apnea,
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.300]   they're going to need the CPAP machine.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.020]   This is a machine that you actually put on your face
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.260]   and it helps you breathe properly and sleep.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.120]   In the daytime, the best way to get good at nasal breathing
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.840]   is to dilate the nasal passages
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.180]   'cause a lot of people have a hard time
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.940]   breathing through their nose.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.240]   And one way to do this
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.020]   is to just breathe through your nose more.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.340]   And one way to do that is that when you exercise
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.500]   in particular cardiovascular exercise,
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.240]   most of the time, provided you're not in maximum effort,
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.940]   you should be nasal breathing.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.520]   Now, for a lot of people,
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.100]   nasal breathing during exercise is hard at first,
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.500]   but as you do it because the sinuses
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.020]   have a capacity to dilate over time,
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.300]   you'll get better at it.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.820]   So my advice would be breathe through your nose
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.960]   while exercising unless you're in maximum effort.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.060]   Pretty soon what you'll find
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.720]   is you actually can create more output
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.640]   than you would if you were breathing through your mouth.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.060]   Learn to be a nasal breather.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.820]   Has positive cosmetic effects.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.340]   It reduces apnea.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.020]   It offloads more carbon dioxide.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.620]   It increases lung capacity.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.040]   It dilates the sinuses and it prevents apnea in sleep.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.820]   So unless you have severe apnea and you need the CPAP,
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.540]   becoming a nasal breather
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.020]   can have all sorts of positive effects
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.860]   by reducing cortisol, reducing apnea,
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.780]   and indirectly raising testosterone and estrogen
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.500]   in the proper ratios.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.260]   The second piece of behavioral advice
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.360]   relates to the viewing of light.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.980]   And many of you have heard me talk about this before,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.860]   and I'm not going to belabor the point
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.160]   that viewing bright light within the first hour of waking,
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.500]   whether or not it's from artificial light
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.780]   or ideally from sunlight,
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.880]   has these powerful effects on sleep and wakefulness.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.780]   But we have to return to this if you want to understand
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.840]   how light can impact hormones,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.020]   because hormones, light, and dopamine
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.860]   have a very close-knit relationship,
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.220]   so much so that your light-viewing behavior
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.340]   can actually have a direct effect
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.460]   on hormone levels and fertility.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.700]   I think most people don't really understand
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.200]   how powerful this relationship is
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.900]   between light, dopamine, hormones.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.260]   And when dopamine levels are high, as I mentioned before,
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.100]   there's a tendency for more
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.540]   gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.580]   luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.540]   all the hormones that come
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.900]   from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.660]   and stimulate estrogen and testosterone release
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.540]   from the ovary and testes.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.140]   So how does this translate to a protocol?
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.500]   If you want to optimize testosterone and estrogen,
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.140]   you need to get your light-viewing behavior correct.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.060]   It's not just about optimizing your sleep,
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.140]   which is also important,
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.860]   it's about getting a sufficient amount of light in your eyes
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.220]   so you have sufficient levels of dopamine.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.220]   So the simple protocols for that I've reviewed before,
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.340]   but it means getting anywhere from two to 10 minutes
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.100]   of bright light exposure in your eyes early in the day.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.820]   It is not sufficient to do this with sunglasses
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.620]   unless you have to do that for safety reasons.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.260]   It's fine to wear prescription lenses and contacts.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.220]   If you can't get sunlight for whatever reason,
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.020]   you want to use bright artificial light.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.020]   But that is absolutely critical
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.420]   for timing the cortisol release properly,
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.980]   limiting cortisol release to the early part of the day,
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.760]   getting increases in dopamine that are going to promote
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.980]   the production of testosterone and estrogen
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.220]   to healthy levels.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.940]   The other aspect of light-viewing behavior
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.460]   that's extremely important
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.620]   is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.740]   in the middle of the night.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.580]   If you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night,
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.560]   you are suppressing dopamine release.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.300]   If you're suppressing dopamine release,
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.980]   you are suppressing testosterone levels.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.380]   So you can't even begin to talk about supplements
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.260]   and other ways to optimize testosterone,
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.420]   diet and its effects on testosterone and estrogen
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.240]   and fertility and reproductive behavior, et cetera,
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.100]   until you get your breathing right,
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.900]   until you get things like
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.620]   your light-viewing behavior right.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.160]   So bright light early in the day
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.060]   and throughout the day is great.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.740]   And avoiding bright light in the middle of the night
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.540]   is not just about not disrupting your sleep.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.540]   It's also about optimizing the sex steroid hormones.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.100]   Okay, so we've talked about breathing.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.640]   We've talked about light.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.000]   Let's talk about a third element
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.540]   that there seems to be some excitement about lately.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.660]   For other reasons, but that can actually have
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.860]   some pretty profound influences on hormone levels.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.900]   And that's heat and cold.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.540]   So as always, rather than just offer a tool,
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.780]   I'm going to tell you the underlying science
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.080]   as it relates to naturally occurring phenomenon,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.420]   because in understanding that
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.880]   and understanding the mechanism,
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.220]   you're going to be in a far better position
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.420]   to understand the tools and mechanisms
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.460]   and how you might want to adjust them for your own life.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.860]   So now you understand the relationship
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.860]   between light, day length, dopamine, and hormone levels.
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.420]   And everyone should realize that temperature
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.260]   and day length are linked.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.660]   Temperature and day length and sunlight,
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.540]   those are all intimately related
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.140]   because of the systems that we evolved in, right?
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.900]   So nowadays there's a lot of interest in using cold
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.140]   as a way to stimulate testosterone.
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.580]   Sounds pretty crazy, but believe it or not,
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.300]   that and things like ice baths and cold showers
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.580]   can have positive effects on the sex steroid hormones.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.820]   What happens is there's a rebound
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.660]   in vasodilation after cooling.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.900]   So cooling causes vasoconstriction.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.980]   And then after the cooling, there's a rebound vasodilation
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.540]   and there's more infusion of blood into the gonads.
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.200]   Put simply, we don't know whether or not cold and heat
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.940]   directly affect the production of testosterone and estrogen.
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.580]   We only know that cold and heat can modulate those
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.340]   probably through indirect mechanisms
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.260]   like controlling the amount of blood flow
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.540]   by way of shutting down or activating the neurons.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.780]   Now let's talk about particular forms of exercise
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.660]   and how they modulate the steroid hormones.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.480]   So what's interesting is when you start digging
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.880]   into the more mechanistic studies,
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.280]   what you find is that heavy weight trainings,
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.500]   but not weight training to failure
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.780]   where completion of a repetition is impossible
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.700]   leads to the greatest increases in testosterone.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.420]   So anywhere from one rep maximum
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.180]   to somewhere in the six to eight repetition range
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.140]   in males or females increases testosterone significantly.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.400]   And it does it for about a day, sometimes up to 48 hours.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.720]   Now, many of you might be endurance athletes
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.220]   or also enjoy exercise
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.580]   besides heavy weight-bearing exercise.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.980]   And there are several studies exploring
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.180]   whether or not endurance activity
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.380]   can increase or decrease androgen levels
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.060]   and whether or not you combine endurance activity
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:35.880]   and weight training,
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.380]   whether or not that has any effect
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.460]   if you do the endurance activity first or second.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.740]   And the takeaway from all of this
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.600]   was that endurance activity, if performed first,
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.360]   leads to decreases in testosterone
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.240]   during the weight training session
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.900]   as compared to the same weight training session done first
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.220]   followed by endurance activity.
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.140]   In other words, if you want to optimize testosterone levels,
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.620]   it seems to be the case that weight training first
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.100]   and doing cardio-type endurance activity afterward
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.040]   is the right order of business.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.680]   Now, when these are done on separate days,
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.500]   it doesn't seem to have an effect.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.820]   They showed no statistical interaction,
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.720]   but it seems that if you're going to do these
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.900]   in the same workout episode,
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.140]   that it's move heavy loads first,
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.580]   then do cardiovascular exercise.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.100]   So there's a little bit of data looking specifically
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.260]   at how endurance exercise impacts testosterone
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.260]   and its derivatives.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.860]   And it's very clear that high-intensity interval training,
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.060]   sprinting, et cetera,
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.860]   which somewhat mimics the neural activity
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.760]   that occurs while moving heavy weight loads
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.820]   is going to increase testosterone.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.500]   There's ample evidence for that in the literature.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:46.260]   And that endurance exercise that extends beyond 75 minutes
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.700]   is going to start to lead to reductions in testosterone,
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.020]   presumably by increases in cortisol.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.900]   So now let's switch over to talking about estrogen.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.940]   So there are many people
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.620]   who are trying to optimize their estrogen levels.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.620]   And one of the places where this shows up a lot,
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.420]   and I get a lot of questions about, is menopause.
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.280]   So menopause, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.700]   is this fairly massive reduction in the amount of estrogen
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.740]   that is circulating in one's blood,
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.740]   mainly because the ovary is now depleted
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.860]   of some estrogen production of its own,
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.560]   the eggs are not being produced,
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.820]   they've been depleted, et cetera.
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.900]   So menopause is characterized by a variety of symptoms.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.040]   Things like hot flashes, things like mood swings,
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.340]   things like headaches, in particular migraine headaches.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.040]   There can be a lot of brain fog.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.380]   It can be very, very disruptive for people.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.340]   So what are the various things
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.920]   that one can do for menopause?
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.540]   Well, one of the most common ones
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.940]   is that physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.700]   So this is hormone therapy
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.780]   where somebody takes either oral estrogen
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.980]   or they'll use a patch or a pellet,
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.380]   some way to secrete estradiol into the system.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.260]   And that has varying success, depending on the individual.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.940]   Some people respond very well to it.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.180]   Other people really have challenges with it.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.260]   And there are a lot of side effects associated with it
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.540]   for some people, not others.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.140]   In addition, there's a concern always
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.780]   about supplementing estrogen
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.060]   when there's a breast cancer background in the family,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.140]   or there's concern about breast cancer for any reason,
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.060]   because a lot of those cancers are estrogen dependent.
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.100]   And that's why drugs like tamoxifen and anastrozole
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.980]   and drugs that block either aromatase
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.180]   or block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.300]   were initially developed.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.340]   Okay, so now let's talk about the role of specific compounds,
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.840]   some of which, many of which,
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.900]   can be taken in supplementation form
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.460]   to optimize sex steroid hormones.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.340]   It's very clear that certain collections of nutrients
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.900]   are useful for promoting testosterone and estrogen production
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.820]   in their proper ratios.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.140]   And those things are what I would call
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.020]   the sort of usual suspects.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.860]   Vitamin D, which is important
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.020]   for so many biological functions,
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.740]   including endocrine functions,
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.140]   zinc, magnesium, et cetera.
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.560]   One of the things that's been shown time and time again
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.780]   to have very negative effects on sex steroid hormones,
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.220]   testosterone mainly in men, estrogen mainly in women,
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.140]   is opioids.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.460]   The opioids dramatically reduce levels
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.420]   of testosterone and estrogen.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.460]   And they do that mainly by disrupting the receptors
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.740]   on gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons,
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.300]   these neurons within the hypothalamus
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.900]   that communicate to the pituitary.
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.220]   And in fact, people that take large amounts of opioids
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.400]   or even take low levels of opioids for long periods of time
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.980]   will develop all sorts of endocrine syndromes.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.820]   That's been shown over and over again.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.660]   Gynecomastia or male breast development in males,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.060]   disruptions to the ovary in females.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.620]   It's really a quite terrible situation.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:54.100]   So excessive opioids are very problematic
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.500]   for sex steroid hormones.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.020]   Now there's an entire industry devoted to supplements
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.420]   and various things that people can take
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.780]   to increase testosterone.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.140]   Some of which have scientific data to support them,
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.700]   some of which do not,
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.140]   and some of which have anecdotal support,
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.820]   and some of which do not.
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.120]   There are supplements, in particular Tonga Ali,
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.700]   which has this other name.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.640]   It's something I call Tonga Ali.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.580]   Sometimes it's called,
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.780]   and these, forgive me that it's hard to pronounce,
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.700]   but uricoma longifolia jack.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.560]   This has been shown in several studies,
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.100]   and you can find these on examine.com
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.380]   or you can go to PubMed if you like.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.220]   I've looked at these.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.740]   That it does seem to have some pro-fertility,
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.740]   pro-free testosterone and subtle aphrodisiac effects.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.520]   It does also seem to be a slight anti-estrogen.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.260]   So the reports of this,
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.380]   people take this anywhere from 400 to 800 milligrams a day.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.840]   Again, I'm not suggesting you do that,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.220]   but that's kind of what's out there.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.820]   And there is some decent scientific literature
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.660]   to support the fact that it liberates
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.760]   some of the bound testosterone
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.500]   and allows more free testosterone to be available.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.840]   Some of the reported quote-unquote side effects
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.820]   are things like excessive alertness and insomnia
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.620]   if it's taken too late in the day and so forth.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.780]   But I encourage you to explore that further
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.500]   if increasing free testosterone
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.060]   is something that you're interested in doing.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.780]   People with different backgrounds and conditions
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.300]   as we talked about for menopause and estrogen
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.300]   have to be careful
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.100]   because when you're starting to modulate hormones,
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.220]   you're starting to modulate not just the tissues
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.100]   that thrive on binding of those hormones,
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.420]   but remember, the reason why there's so much breast cancer
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.540]   and there's a reason why there's so much testicular cancer
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.440]   is that any tissue that undergoes rapid reproduction
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   of particular cells.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.860]   So there's a lot of reproduction of cells
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.080]   and shedding of uterine lining
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.760]   and the reproduction of cells and eggs in the ovary.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.460]   And in the testes, there's the production
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.420]   of Lydig and Sertoli cells.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.860]   And there's this kind of ongoing production of sperm.
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.640]   That's why those tissues are particularly vulnerable
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.840]   to the development of cancers.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.060]   And many of those cancers are androgen sensitive.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.440]   That's why one of the major treatments
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.920]   for prostate overgrowth or prostate cancer
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.640]   is to give anti-androgenic drugs.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.360]   It's really about trying to prevent testosterone
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.280]   from encouraging growth of tumors.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.160]   So I want to really emphasize the caution there
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.520]   because it is easy when thinking about optimizing estrogen
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.080]   and testosterone to just think, oh, more is better.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.560]   More is definitely not better.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.400]   Any tissue that recycles itself is prone to cancers
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.420]   and those tissues thrive on androgens and estrogens
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.800]   to create more tumors.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.040]   So you have to be careful
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.560]   anytime you're modulating hormones,
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.280]   especially androgens and estrogens.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.420]   And while we're talking about supplementation,
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.020]   the effects of supplementation,
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.720]   I would say in some individuals can be quite dramatic,
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.300]   but they're always, always, always,
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.840]   except in extreme cases,
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.160]   going to be far more subtle than would be,
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.120]   for instance, just in injecting testosterone
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.360]   or injecting estrogen, et cetera.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.700]   So I think we should just be honest and upfront about that.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.420]   So thus far in terms of talking about optimizing hormones
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.860]   and in the discussion of supplementation,
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.220]   I haven't really talked about things
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.160]   that actually affect the brain directly,
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.220]   that increase the pituitary output and things of that sort.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.300]   We've mainly been talking about things
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.900]   that free up testosterone
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.020]   or that increase estrogen at the level of the periphery.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.120]   But if you remember way back
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.420]   to the beginning of this episode,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.540]   hormones are made in different locations in the body
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.260]   and there are hormones that promote the release
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.800]   and the production of hormones
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.880]   from other tissues in the body.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.560]   And one of the main hormones for that is luteinizing hormone.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.760]   Luteinizing hormone, again, comes from the pituitary,
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.280]   circulates, and either goes to the ovary
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:45.280]   to promote various aspects of egg maturation,
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.080]   as well as production of estrogen,
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.440]   and to the testes to promote testosterone
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.140]   and sperm production.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.800]   And the prescription version
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.420]   of increasing luteinizing hormone
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.180]   is something called HCG or human chorionic gonadotropin,
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.340]   which has been synthesized
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.900]   and is now available as a prescription drug.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.300]   It's taken in various contexts for increasing fertility,
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.460]   both by males and by females.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.120]   It can increase for all the reasons that now make sense.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.460]   It can increase sperm production.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.460]   It can produce ovulation frequency.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.300]   It can produce the number of eggs
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.060]   even that are deployed in a given ovulation,
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.880]   although that's not always a good thing.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.480]   It basically is pro-fertility, pro-testosterone,
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.400]   pro-estrogen, depending on your background.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:39.400]   And what's interesting is HCG was initially synthesized,
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.680]   collected and synthesized from pregnant women's urine.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.440]   And believe it or not, before it was synthetically made
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.160]   and sold as a prescription drug,
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.200]   there was actually a black market
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.700]   for pregnant women's urine where people would buy the urine.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.540]   I don't know.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.240]   I'm guessing that they probably just consumed it,
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.080]   which is weird.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.640]   But in any case, human chorionic gonadotropin
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.760]   is now available as a prescription drug.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.000]   And it's one of the things that many people use
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.600]   to increase testosterone or estrogen
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.220]   for increasing fertility.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.800]   But there are certain supplements, not many,
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.400]   that apparently can increase luteinizing hormone
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   and thereby can increase testosterone and estrogen.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.960]   And one of the more well-documented ones
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.560]   is phytogia agrestis, that's F-A-D-O-G-I-A,
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.320]   separate word A-G-R-E-S-T-I-S,
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.320]   which at least according to the literature
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.440]   that I was able to find,
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.480]   can increase levels of luteinizing hormone
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.820]   and thereby levels of testosterone or levels of estrogen.
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.160]   The side effect profile of phytogia agrestis
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.400]   hasn't really been documented, so it's a little unclear.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.720]   I just want to emphasize that anytime someone's going
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.120]   to start taking supplements
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.760]   or modifying sex steroid hormones,
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.600]   getting blood work done is extremely important
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.220]   for safety reasons and also just to know
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.980]   whether or not things are working.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.240]   And because all of these things are subject
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.520]   to negative feedback, talked about this previously,
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.440]   previous episode, but if testosterone goes high or too high,
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.200]   it can feed back and shut down luteinizing hormone,
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.080]   which will then shut down for the testosterone production.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.460]   Likewise, if estrogens are going too high
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.020]   or they're going too high at various phases of the cycle,
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.320]   that can start to throw off various other hormones,
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.780]   including FSH, progesterone, LH.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.460]   The menstrual cycle itself is a just absolutely
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.100]   exquisite balance of feedback of luteinizing hormone
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.380]   kept low and constant,
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.680]   at least for the first 14 days of the cycle.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.220]   Then mid cycle, there's a peak,
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.040]   and that's typically when ovulation occurs.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.820]   That's why pregnancy is most likely
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.000]   during the middle of the 28-day cycle.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   FSH kind of goes up and then down across the first 14 days.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.040]   So taking anything or really modifying one's estrogens
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.240]   or testosterone on that background of the menstrual cycle
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.660]   is really going to disrupt the way those things interact.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.960]   And it's just such an exquisite feedback loop.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.060]   So I'm not saying don't do that,
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.720]   but you definitely want to be aware of what you're doing.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   And blood draws are one way to do that.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.660]   Monitoring cycles for ovulating females
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.560]   is another way to do that.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.800]   And in males, having a good window
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.480]   into what's going on with testosterone,
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:26.480]   DHT, aromatase, estradiol, LH, et cetera, is just vital.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.640]   And it's really part and parcel with the practice
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.220]   of thinking about optimizing these incredible things
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.840]   that we call sex steroid hormones,
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.240]   estrogen, and testosterone, and their derivatives.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.060]   So once again,
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.280]   we covered a tremendous amount of information.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.080]   I hope that you'll come away from this
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.160]   with a deeper mechanistic understanding
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.040]   of how the brain and body are interacting
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.080]   to control the output
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.260]   and the ways in which these incredible things
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.480]   that we call sex steroid hormones work and influence us.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.160]   I hope you'll also come away with some ideas
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.680]   of things that you can do in particular behavioral practices
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.640]   that can improve sleep and your relationship to light,
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.360]   et cetera, because those things really set the foundation,
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.100]   not just for healthy steroid hormone output,
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.200]   but for all sorts of health effects
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.300]   and for both the psychology
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.480]   and the biology of your nervous system.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.860]   In closing, I hope you'll leave today's episode
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.580]   with a much richer understanding of the mechanisms
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.680]   that control the endocrine and nervous system
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.360]   in the context of estrogen and testosterone,
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.340]   as well as take away various tools
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.920]   that you might choose to apply.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.700]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.280]   [upbeat music]
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.860]   (upbeat music)
