[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.440]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 5 and verse 14.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.240]   The 14th verse in the 5th chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:25.960]   "Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.880]   give thee light."
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:36.640]   Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.000]   In other words, we are returning this morning to our studies in the epistle to the Ephesians
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.020]   which we left off at the end of last December in order that we might call a direct attention
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.480]   to what I regard as incomparably the most important subject that should engage the minds
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.160]   and hearts of Christian people at the present time, namely the subject of revival, the need
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.880]   of an outpouring of the Spirit of God.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.360]   It isn't that we are ceasing to deal with that because every exposition of the Scripture
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.080]   should urge us in that direction by reminding us of the seriousness of the times in which
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.720]   we live and the fact that the only adequate answer is such a visitation by the Spirit
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.600]   of God.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.720]   But there we, for twenty-six Sunday mornings, dealt with that explicitly and directly by
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.640]   preaching on the subject of revival.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.520]   We now come back to this study of this epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.800]   And as we do so, nothing is more important, of course, than that we should be clear as
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.280]   to the context of this particular statement which we are looking at together this morning.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.160]   So I would remind you very hurriedly of that, the very word wherefore makes us do that.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.040]   Our theme is introduced with this word wherefore, because of that, in the light of that.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.880]   Well what is that?
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.180]   The answer to the question is that we are here in what we may call the practical section
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.220]   of this epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.480]   It began roughly at the beginning of the fourth chapter.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.080]   The apostle in the first three chapters had been laying down his mighty doctrines.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.520]   He had been reminding these people of the great truth as it is in Christ Jesus, the
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.720]   unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.760]   And having done so, he now begins to apply all that, to point out that this is not merely
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.400]   something theoretical or academic, that it is all meant to have a very practical intent,
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.560]   and that the Christian life is characterized always by the balance of the two sides, the
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.480]   doctrine and the practice.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.040]   So he says, "I therefore, the prisoner of the law, beseech you."
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.320]   And so he begins the practical section at the first verse of the fourth chapter.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.660]   And it does so in a still more specific manner in the seventeenth verse of that fourth chapter.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.700]   Having started on it at the beginning of chapter four, he then went off into a marvelous exposition
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.960]   of the nature of the Church.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.100]   It was almost pure doctrine again.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.280]   But then back he comes at verse seventeen to the practical application in a more direct
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.280]   manner.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.000]   "I therefore, the prisoner of the law, beseech you, and testify in the Lord that
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.960]   ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk."
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.400]   And then he goes on to describe it.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   Very well.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.720]   Here, I said, we are dealing with very practical everyday matters, and we are continuing this
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   consideration.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.320]   Now let us remind ourselves of one other thing.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.880]   Something to me is more fascinating than to observe this great apostle's method.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.080]   When he deals with practical matters such as he is dealing with here—conversation,
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.280]   behavior, how we should deal with others, and so on—you notice that his method is
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.400]   this.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:21.000]   He always puts it first in the form of a great principle, then he comes to his application.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.520]   So I am saying that we are in the practical half of this great epistle.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.560]   We must not run away with the idea that he has said farewell to doctrine, because he
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.320]   hasn't.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.160]   In this section, what we get is a kind of combination again of doctrine and practice.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.040]   In other words, he picks out certain aspects of doctrine and points out how in the light
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.200]   of that a certain type of conduct is required.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.880]   In other words, he doesn't divorce practice and behavior from doctrine.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.860]   His argument always is that there should be no real need to press these matters upon Christians
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.720]   if they understand who and what they are.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.920]   So he reminds them.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.540]   We should never be doing anything in the Christian life merely for the sake of doing it.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.840]   We should never live any part of our Christian life simply because somebody has told us to
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   do so.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.440]   Alas, there are many Christians who seem to me to be doing that.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   They have been converted and then they have a code of conduct imposed upon them.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.520]   They don't understand it.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.360]   They don't know why they are living it, but it's the thing to do now as a Christian.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.120]   Now that's never the Apostle's method.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.160]   He always gives a reason.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.680]   He always puts it in the form of an appeal almost to common sense.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.400]   He says, "If you claim this, well then, you can't go on living like that, but you
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.040]   must live like this."
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.960]   And so he's been doing that.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.680]   The first thing he reminded them of was the fact that they have been born again.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.000]   They are not as other Gentiles.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.400]   They have had this new birth.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.640]   Well, he says, because you are no longer what you were, you don't go on living as you were.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   Isn't it obvious?
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.040]   He says, "If you claim that you are born again and born of the Spirit and that you
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.120]   are partakers of the divine nature, well, surely you don't go on behaving as you used
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.360]   to do before, before any of that had happened to you."
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.120]   Now that's his first appeal.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.480]   Then secondly, towards the end of chapter four, he puts it like this to them.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.560]   He says, "Remember that the Spirit of God dwells in you."
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.960]   You claim that as Christians?
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.120]   Well, very well.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.000]   If that is so, well, don't grieve the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed into
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.360]   the day of redemption.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.140]   It's inconsistent.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.080]   If you say that you glory in the fact that the Spirit is dwelling within you, well, you
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.400]   can't possibly live in a manner that you know is going to grieve the Spirit.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.040]   And then the third appeal was, "Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children."
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.600]   At the beginning of chapter five, he says, "You are children of God.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.480]   Christ died for you, he gave himself for you, in order that you might be the children of
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.840]   God and might become an offering and a sacrifice to God, as it were, for a sweet-smelling savor,
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.400]   in the sense that he was, because you are in him."
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.440]   Well, now, he says, if you claim that and if you realize that, you can't possibly
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.600]   go on living as you were living in the past.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.120]   And that brings us to the present section.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.920]   Here, he again takes up an argument, but it's a slightly different one.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:42.680]   The argument now is this, that as Christians, we can say of ourselves, and we must say of
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.000]   ourselves, that we are now light in the Lord.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.360]   "Ye were sometimes," he says in verse eight, "darkness, but now are ye light in
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   the Lord."
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.920]   Well, then, walk as children of light.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.520]   Now, that's the matter that he has taken up in this particular paragraph that we're
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.720]   looking at.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.120]   Christians are children of the light.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.400]   They are not only that, they are light in the Lord.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.920]   And he's pointed out that that means that the main characteristics of our life, the
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.560]   fruit of our life, should be goodness and righteousness and truth.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.440]   And having put that down as a principle, he says, well, now then, in the light of this,
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.440]   you therefore cannot be partakers with people who are still in darkness.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.720]   That was verse seven.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.480]   "Be ye not ye therefore partakers with them."
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.720]   But he doesn't even stop at that.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.120]   He goes on in verse eleven to say, "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.220]   darkness."
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.560]   And we saw what that means.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.200]   Don't take an interest in it.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   Don't let people get the impression that after all that's where your heart is, and
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.040]   you're rather like hearing about all this and having fellowship with them in it.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.720]   No, he says, you can't.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.160]   You can't mix light and darkness.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.480]   There's no fellowship there.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.680]   There's no communion.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.320]   So don't have any fellowship.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.560]   But he went further.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.160]   He said, "You must even reprove it."
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:19.400]   Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.880]   And we considered what that meant.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.800]   It means that we should make perfectly plain and clear what our attitude is toward all
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   this.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.520]   Of course, we do so in the right and in a loving spirit.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.440]   If we do it as Pharisees, we might as well not do it at all.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.280]   We'll do more harm than good.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:41.520]   There is a way of speaking the truth in love and reproving that which is wrong and evil.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.440]   And having said that, he began to say this.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:50.560]   He said, "All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.360]   All whatsoever doth make manifest is light."
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.400]   In other words, his argument is this.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   Now, you, he says, as people who are light, obviously must reprove darkness.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.760]   Light always does that.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.060]   Light always reproves darkness by exposing it.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.520]   Things happen in the dark, you flash a light, and people are exposed in their conduct and
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.940]   behavior.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:24.840]   Light always exposes, reproves, brings to light the things, the hidden things of darkness.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.320]   It shows them up, it shows their character, and thereby it reproves them.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:37.080]   Now his argument is that that is the characteristic of light always.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.640]   Whatever is reproved, he says, is clearly in the light, because it is light alone that
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.080]   can do this.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.120]   And then, having said that, he proceeds to this general statement, which we are going
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.840]   to look at this morning.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:11:00.560]   He says the great characteristic of light always is that it reproves, makes manifest,
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.160]   brings clearly forward, shows, exposes.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:11.920]   And that is the great characteristic of the Christian gospel.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.760]   And so he sums up his whole statement about this matter of the Christian being light by
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:23.920]   saying, "Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.320]   Christ shall give thee light."
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   Now then, what does this mean?
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.160]   Well, it is at one and the same time, as I say, a kind of summing up of this point he
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.520]   is making about the light, but it is in addition, of course, a very wonderful reminder to us
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:46.240]   of what we should be as Christian people, and especially in our relationships with those
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.560]   who are not Christians, which is the apostle's main point in this particular section.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.520]   Now then, let us look at what he says.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:12:01.080]   He begins by saying, "Wherefore he saith," and that is his formula, of course, for saying
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.600]   that he is quoting Scripture.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.120]   It is—I could give you many illustrations of this—that this is the apostle's way
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.520]   of introducing a scriptural reference, a scriptural quotation.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.320]   Well, then, says somebody, "What scripture is he quoting?"
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.720]   And the moment you begin to look into that question, you will find that he is not quoting
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.080]   any one exact or particular scripture.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:34.640]   I agree with those who say that the nearest, probably, is what you find in Isaiah 60, in
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.800]   the first verse, where you read this, "Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.280]   of the Lord is risen upon thee."
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.640]   And yet you notice it is not exactly that.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.000]   Well, now then, what do we make of this?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.600]   Well, here, surely, is a very interesting and important point.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.360]   There are many people who get into difficulties at this point with regard to the whole question
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.840]   of the inspiration of the Scripture.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.720]   How can the apostle say, "This is what the Scripture says," and then he makes a statement
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.280]   which is not an exact scriptural quotation?
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.560]   I say it is an interesting point, because it seems to me there is only one answer to
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.000]   it and it is this.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.720]   The apostle here, himself under the inspiration and guidance of the same Holy Spirit who inspired
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:38.560]   Isaiah and the other New Testament writers, is giving the meaning and the point and the
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.200]   purport of quite a number of Old Testament scriptures.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.000]   That is what he is doing here.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.880]   He is, as it were, summing up, picking out, emphasizing a statement which is made very
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:58.200]   frequently, particularly by this prophet Isaiah, but also in various other prophecies and in
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.760]   the Psalms in the Old Testament.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.560]   And thereby, I would say, we have a most wonderful proof of the inspiration of both the Old Testament
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.360]   and the epistles of the apostle Paul.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.280]   If the apostle Paul were but writing as a man, well, then he would have been very careful
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.600]   to turn up his reference to give the exact wording.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:22.680]   But under the inspiration and guidance of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit himself who put
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.320]   it in one form in the Old, puts it in this form in the New.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:33.400]   The meaning is identical, and the one is as inspired and as authoritative as the other.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.800]   So that the apostle Peter is perfectly right to when you remember in his second epistle
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:45.840]   and in the third chapter, he says that there are certain people who misunderstand the epistles
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:53.000]   and writings of the apostle Paul as they do also, he says, the other scriptures.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.720]   They rest the scriptures, he says, to their own confusion and destruction.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.280]   And he puts the writings of this apostle in exactly the same category as the scriptures
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.920]   of the Old Testament.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.400]   How right it is!
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.320]   It is the same Spirit, it is the same author, it is the same one who guides.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.800]   So in passing, I merely say this in passing, it seems to me that this very formula that
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:24.240]   the apostle uses and what he does here is a very wonderful lesson to us on the whole
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.080]   doctrine of the inspiration of the scriptures.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.440]   However, our immediate matter this morning is this.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.000]   What is the apostle saying here?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.440]   Why does he make this statement to these Ephesian Christians?
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.120]   And here I suggest the answer is this.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.520]   This is a summary of the gospel.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.280]   This is a summary of what the gospel does.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:55.040]   Those Old Testament prophets look forward to the coming of the Messiah, the day of Christ,
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.000]   the day of the gospel.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.040]   And they ask the question, what will characterize it?
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.800]   And the answer is invariable.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.040]   It will be a period of light, it will be illumination, it will be a day of knowledge.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.200]   That is the meaning.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.720]   "Arise, shine, for thy light is come."
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   This is it.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.680]   It is the light of the gospel and all the evangelical prophets.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.960]   And every evangelical passage in the prophet likes to put it in this particular way.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:28.120]   Well now then, says Paul, surely it is unnecessary for me to emphasize this point for you.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.680]   You must know that the whole characteristic of the gospel era and dispensation is that
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.320]   it is light.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:44.400]   And therefore it is the business of the Christian to be a manifester of this light, to be one
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.320]   who illumines his friends and his circumstances and his surroundings.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:56.160]   So that by this verse this morning we can remind ourselves of the great characteristics
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.760]   of the Christian gospel.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:06.200]   Its primary function and purpose, and also we can test and examine ourselves as to whether
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.160]   we are behaving in this way and manner.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.520]   Now then, let's look at it like this.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.360]   What does the gospel do?
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:23.000]   The answer is that it comes primarily and essentially as a great light.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.320]   Don't you remember how Matthew at the beginning of the gospel, of his gospel, makes that quotation
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:38.800]   and how perfect it is, "The people that sat in darkness have seen a great light."
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.360]   There's mankind without the gospel sitting in darkness.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.120]   What does the coming of the gospel do?
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.480]   Well, it is this flash of light.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:55.520]   The people that sat in darkness have seen a great light.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   Or take the apostle Paul himself.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.800]   Isn't this his favorite way of presenting the gospel and its effect?
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.280]   Listen to him in 2 Corinthians 4, 6 for instance.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:24.120]   give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.680]   That is the great characteristic of the gospel.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.680]   What does it do?
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.720]   Well, this is what it does.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:35.280]   It comes to men and women and says, "Awake there that sleepest, and rise from the dead,
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.920]   and Christ shall shine upon thee."
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.920]   Now this is the great characteristic of the gospel, and I'm very happy to call your attention
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.040]   to it this morning, not only as we resume this study of the epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.520]   but on this particular Sunday.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:56.000]   I cannot imagine anything that is more remote from the function of the Christian church
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.160]   and from the business of the preaching of the gospel than for men to be taking this
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:06.440]   day as an opportunity to talk about politics and to tell people how to exercise their vote
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440]   on Thursdays.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:14.120]   Ah, my friend, it is our duty to do these things as citizens, but I say the business
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:20.640]   of the Christian church is not to be talking about politics and international affairs.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   It is to be issuing this mighty call.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:33.200]   "Awake now that sleepest, and rise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee."
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.000]   What's needed is not a change of government, not one party rather than another.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.200]   It doesn't matter which you have.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:45.320]   The darkness remains, and the business of the gospel is to illumine this darkness.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.680]   That's her task.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.320]   And if she fails in that task, all her other efforts are vain and useless and a sure waste
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.520]   of energy.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.360]   Of course, they will be applauded by the world, but the business of the church is not to be
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.960]   applauded by the world.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.320]   It is to be well-pleasing in the sight of God, her Lord, and her Master.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.920]   Well very well then, what does she do?
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.880]   Well, the first thing she does is to convict.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.800]   Awake, arise.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.200]   Why?
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.640]   Well realize the position that you're in.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.000]   And what is this position?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.280]   Well it's one of sleep.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.560]   It is one of death.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.800]   The trouble with the world, the trouble with all who are not Christians, is that they're
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.320]   in this condition of unconsciousness.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.360]   And sleep and death are the same in that respect.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.760]   Both are unconscious, both are unaware of certain matters that are happening round about
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.200]   them, certain possibilities, certain dangers.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.800]   They're unaware, sleeping, unconscious.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.600]   Think of a man in a house on fire.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.200]   He doesn't know it's on fire, he's asleep, and you rush to him and say, "Awake thou
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:03.440]   that sleepest, get out of it as quickly as you can."
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.320]   What are they unconscious of?
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:15.080]   They are unconscious and unaware of the most important things in life, the most important
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.240]   things in the world.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.320]   The apostle has already been saying this at great length in chapter 2, so I don't stay
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.040]   to go through it in detail this morning.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.640]   You remember how he put it there?
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:34.360]   "Yeareth he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past he walked according
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.960]   to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.800]   that now worketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:50.400]   in times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:22:00.520]   the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others."
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:07.200]   It means, you see, a deadness to the spiritual realm.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.520]   It means a deadness to the fact of God and the being of God.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:20.560]   It means an unawareness of the soul within, given by God this peculiar thing that makes
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:25.920]   man man, completely unaware of that.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:31.640]   And that is the state of the world and of society, isn't it?
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.080]   Isn't that the tragedy of man in sin?
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.160]   Look at all his activity and his bustling and his business and his excitement and his
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.600]   being thrilled, and the arguments and the disputations and the counter-arguments, the
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:49.000]   questions and answers and replies, how marvellous it all seems, and yet it is all missing the
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   main thing.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:00.200]   Isn't that the tragedy of this world and of this very country this morning?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:06.640]   The people in all the parties are dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.960]   Isn't it amusing to see how this comes out?
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.920]   If it were not tragic, how amusing it would be.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:18.160]   Each one charges the other with selfishness.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.960]   One says, "Look at those people, they're out for themselves, they don't pay this
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.800]   tax and they evade this or that."
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.840]   But then the other man is trying to do exactly the same thing, and he's annoyed with the
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:31.920]   first simply because he's succeeding more than he is succeeding.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.920]   What's the matter?
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:40.080]   The matter is that they're both asleep, they're both dead, and that is why they're
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.960]   both, three or four if you like, it doesn't matter what the number is, you can multiply
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.460]   your parties as much as you like, it won't change human nature.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.520]   And human nature is selfish and self-centred.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.360]   They talk about principles.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.180]   They would have us believe all of them, that they're quite altruistic and are looking
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.840]   on in a calm and a detached manner.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:08.480]   Man in sin never does that, he never can, because he is spiritually dead.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:14.760]   While man is dead to the being of God and his relationship to him, and to his true being
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:22.840]   and dignity as a creation of God and as a child of God, he never will do anything else.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.400]   It's impossible, he cannot.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.520]   He's governed by the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.600]   the children of disobedience.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.120]   He sets himself up as a god, always revolving around himself, thinking of nothing and nobody
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.040]   but himself and his own interests.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.400]   That's the trouble.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.600]   And that is man in sin, he's asleep, he's dead.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.720]   He's unaware of all this, this appalling ignorance.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.000]   And how appalling it is, with all the knowledge and learning and sophistication, ignorant
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   of the thing that matters supremely, above everything.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.560]   But then of course that in turn leads to a very terrible way of living.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.280]   Life without Christ is a sort of living death.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.040]   Look at the awful kind of life such people live.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.000]   The apostle has already been describing it in chapter 4, having the understanding darkened,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.120]   being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, who being past
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:32.640]   feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.000]   You know my friends, that's the problem of this country, and that's why I don't
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   stand here to preach politics.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.480]   I'm here to deal with the great problem, which is not political.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.880]   It is this, it is this moral, it is this spiritual question.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.240]   Your country finally will be ruined unless this is dealt with.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.800]   The decline and fall of the Roman Empire, what was the cause of it?
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:03.040]   Well the answer was, it wasn't anything political, it wasn't anything military.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.440]   It was essentially moral and spiritual.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:11.480]   It was the moral rot that set in, and it has been the cause of the downfall of most of
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.160]   the great empires.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.560]   This moral rot that comes in, which leads to indolence and then to sin and to lasciviousness
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:26.900]   and a living for evil and for vice, it saps the vitality of a nation as it saps the vitality
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.320]   of a man.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:36.000]   And it is all the result of this ignorance that results from sleep or from death.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.400]   But they're quite unaware of this.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.160]   They think it's monstrous for intelligent people to be attending a place of worship.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.360]   Of course, you attend political meetings, you listen to these people on the television
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.280]   that are wireless, and you go your culture around.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.200]   But the old gospel, they think it's so irrelevant and has nothing to do with life.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.960]   My dear friends, this alone has.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.920]   And as long as this is neglected, you can do all the others.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.440]   It will avail you nothing.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:08.360]   The chief problem in this country today, when you're looking at it even industrially or
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:16.120]   economically or anything else, is the attitude of men and women towards life.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.640]   By manipulating the political procedures, you don't change that.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.080]   And while men regard work as a nuisance, I don't care whether they're masters or servants.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.320]   And while the majority of your people are living for pleasure and indolence and indulgence
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:36.440]   and the gratification of their lusts, rather than having a sense of duty and duty to God
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:42.480]   above all else, loving God with all your heart and mind and soul and strength, and your neighbor
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:49.280]   as yourself, whatever class he belongs to, there is no hope.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.280]   But that is the position.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.960]   They're asleep, they're dead, they're not aware of this.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.120]   And it is the gospel alone that enlightens people about this.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   And then think of their terrible danger, the danger in which men, apart from Christ, find
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:16.440]   himself, moving in the direction of eternity, subject to death at any moment.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:23.160]   Oh, how concerned he is about sixpence or whatever it is off the income tax, how he
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.080]   argues and gets excited about it, and that he may have a few more shillings or a few
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:36.240]   more pounds here or there, or this or that, and never thinks about himself dying.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:44.160]   Oh, he's interested in pensions, of course, and that his widow should have a pension,
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:50.000]   and that his burial, the payment for his burial should be provided for.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.920]   But never a thought about how to die, never a thought about what's going to happen to
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.880]   him for certain, whatever party is in power, whatever may happen in the world, whether
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.600]   you ban your armaments or not, he's got to die.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.240]   Never thinks about it.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:14.240]   Never thinks about standing before God in eternity and in the judgment, and his everlasting
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   destiny pronounced.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:26.800]   Asleep, dead, and there's nothing that can open the eyes of men and women to this but
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.720]   the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:35.560]   Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead, so it comes to men.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.720]   It convicts, but it converts.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720]   It also converts.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720]   Awake, it says.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.720]   It shuffles the men, it awakens him.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:50.000]   Arise, it puts power in him to come out.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.520]   It calls upon him to escape, which being interpreted, of course, means this, that it calls upon
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:05.800]   him to repent, to realize his awful, tragic, desperate position, and immediately to acknowledge
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:12.840]   it before God, to see the enormity of it all, the utter folly of it all, the tragedy of
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:18.120]   such ignorance and darkness, and to come out of it and to leave it.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.840]   And the moment a man sees these things, he doesn't want to stay there.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.880]   He hates it all.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:32.080]   Love and not the world are the things that are in the world.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.960]   And the moment a man sees them for what they are and sees himself, he stops loving them,
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.280]   he hates them, and he turns away from them.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.240]   "Turn you, turn you," says the gospel, and he's very ready to listen.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:49.160]   And he comes out, he escapes out of his grave, he rises from his bed.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:55.000]   As John Bunyan puts it once and forever in his immortal allegory, he rushes from the
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.200]   city of destruction as fast as his feet can carry him.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.480]   And the message of the gospel is that the world is a city of destruction.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:10.600]   It is governed by this Prince of the Power of the Earth, this God of this world, and
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:16.160]   all these infernal powers that the Apostle is going to speak of in chapter 6, when he
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.840]   says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood, we are not up against men, whoever
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:27.360]   they are, but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.200]   world, against spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.640]   That's the problem.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.240]   And a man sees this, and he longs to be out of it and to escape from it, and he separates
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   himself from it.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.160]   That's the argument of the Apostle here.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.960]   He says you are sometimes darkness, but you are now light in the Lord.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.600]   Walk as children of light.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.640]   Well the gospel does this second thing.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:56.160]   After convicting us, it converts us, and then it brings us into this new life.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:04.400]   "Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon you."
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.320]   Or, if you like, "Christ shall give you light."
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   What does this mean?
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:14.640]   Well, I think this is a kind of repetition of the statement of our Lord himself in John
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.880]   8, verse 12.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.840]   He says, "I am the light of the world.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.560]   Oh, that's it.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:39.120]   Coming out of this grave, awaking out of this sleep, you come into the broad sunshine of
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.360]   God and of Christ.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.040]   I am the light of the world.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.320]   You've been living in caverns, you've been living in caves, you've been down in graves
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.180]   and sepulchres, and you didn't know that there was such a thing as light.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.180]   You thought that was wonderful.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.600]   You tried to keep up your courage, you tried to enjoy it.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.200]   Suddenly you're called out into the broad sunshine of a noonday.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.680]   Christ, I am the light of the world.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:14.800]   He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.880]   What's he mean?
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   He means this, my dear friend.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:26.920]   He'll give you life itself, and life is light and light is life.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.520]   You are the quickened who are dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.760]   That's a part of the light, giving you life.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:40.400]   But then, of course, it refers especially to the understanding.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:46.640]   This is the first thing our blessed Lord does for us, is to enlighten the eyes of our understanding.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:55.160]   Oh, thank God for this, that he enables us to see life truly, he enables us to see ourselves.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:00.780]   He brings us into the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.280]   And you see, that's why a Christian man is absolutely different from a man who's
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   not a Christian.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.280]   He can't help it.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   He is different.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:14.400]   Take how the apostle puts it in this great statement of it in 1 Corinthians 2.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.840]   You see, he says, "We have received not the spirit that is of the world, but the spirit
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:23.920]   which is of God, that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God."
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.160]   But he says, "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for there
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:35.320]   is foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:41.440]   But he that is spiritual, here's your Christian, he judgeth, can estimate and understand all
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:46.820]   things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.520]   He has an understanding, but nobody can understand him.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.120]   And isn't it so absolutely true?
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:58.080]   If you've never been told yet by a non-Christian that they can't quite understand you, I
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.160]   doubt whether you're a Christian.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:06.040]   The moment we become Christians, we can no longer be understood by those who are not
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.040]   Christians.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.520]   The Christian understandeth all things, yet he himself is understood of no man.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.920]   For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.320]   And here's the answer.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:21.920]   But we have the mind of Christ.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.680]   We are seeing everything in a new way.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:34.520]   Yes, it is perfectly true, God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:43.560]   in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.720]   "Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee."
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   And that's what he'll do.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.280]   He'll give you a glimpse of the glory of God as your Father, as your Savior.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.200]   He'll give you an understanding of God's purpose.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:03.720]   You included, the great plan of redemption and salvation, the ultimate, final consummation
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.240]   of all things in Christ.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.720]   He'll explain that to you.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.200]   Well, of course, this is but repetition.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.040]   Paul said it all in chapter one of this great epistle.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.120]   Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:22.000]   he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather in
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.560]   one all things in Christ, both which are in him and which are on earth, even in him.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.560]   That's it.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.720]   "Christ shall shine upon thee."
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   What's it mean?
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.240]   Well, it means this.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:45.760]   We shall have fellowship with Christ, and we shall walk with him.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.000]   John in his first epistle writes, and he says, "Are these things right, I unto you, that
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.400]   ye may have fellowship with us?
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:59.840]   And our fellowship indeed is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ."
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.840]   That's a Christian.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.320]   A Christian is a man who has fellowship with God and with his Son, Jesus Christ, through
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.320]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   What's it mean?
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   It means this.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:16.160]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:21.040]   And we are to walk in the light as he is in the light.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.320]   "Christ shall shine upon thee."
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.440]   Yes, you follow him.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.320]   And there'll be a bright light always before you.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.200]   It will reprove and illuminate and expose the evil and the foul and the ugly and the
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.720]   harmful things that are around and about you.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.120]   It will tell you to evade them and to hate them, as he did.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.880]   He walks in the middle of the road, and you walk after him.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.800]   Christ the light, and you're following him.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:51.680]   You're no longer walking in darkness, but you're enjoying the light of life.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.560]   You go through this world as he went.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:03.300]   You have entered into the fellowship of the life eternal.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:11.800]   It means following Christ, enjoying fellowship with him, having this light and this knowledge
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:18.840]   which he gives and ever sheds upon every question, enjoying it, reveling in it, and walking in
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.240]   it.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.560]   That is what the gospel does.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.040]   Well, very well, it is its great function.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.440]   The prophet Isaiah looked forward and he said, "That's the day that's coming.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.680]   Arise, shine, for thy light is come."
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.680]   This is what it says.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.600]   "Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee."
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.640]   How does it do this?
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.280]   How does the gospel have this effect?
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.400]   How does it produce it in this world?
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.740]   And do you know the answer the apostle gives here?
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:45.740]   It is this.
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.440]   It is largely through you and me.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.440]   Wherefore?
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:39:01.400]   Wherefore he said, "The Lord who said, 'I am the light of the world,' also said, 'Ye
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   are the light of the world.'"
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.200]   "Ye are the light of the world."
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.320]   You don't hide your light under a bushel, he says, but put it under a candlestick.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.960]   A city that is set upon a hill cannot be hid.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:18.320]   So this work of enlightenment takes place in the world through you and me.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:28.360]   "Let your light," he says, "so shine before men that they may see your good works, and
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.840]   glorify your Father which is in heaven."
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:39.280]   "Oh," says Paul, "you were sometimes darkness, but you are now light in the Lord.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.720]   Walk as children of the light.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.240]   Have no fellowship with the unfruitful work of darkness.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.920]   Rather, reprove them.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.360]   Let your light shine so that men and women looking at you and seeing you will begin to
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.120]   see where they are and what is true of them, and to hate what they are doing, and to have
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:59.440]   a horror of where they are, and rise out of it because they have seen you and your life
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.480]   become a call to them, saying, 'Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.320]   Christ shall give thee light.'"
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   You see, that is his whole argument.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.080]   We are saved to save.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:21.120]   We are saved to become channels and means and instruments, disseminating this glorious
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:26.800]   light and delivering men and women from the captivity and the bondage and the terrible
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   danger of sin.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:36.720]   It is through us partly, what we are, what we say, our explanation of the gospel, our
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.440]   conversation with people, all that does this.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:47.520]   And of course, it does it through the power of the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.640]   Merely for us to talk does not do it.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.800]   Merely for a man like myself to stand in a pulpit and preach in and of itself does not
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   do it.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.480]   I may utter the right words, but they will do nothing in and of themselves.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.120]   I have no power to awaken the sleeper.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:09.240]   I have no power to resurrect the dead.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.360]   But the Spirit of God has.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:18.080]   You hath he quickened that were dead in trespasses and sin?
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.800]   The statement is not, "Awake, rise from the dead, and then afterwards Christ will
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   give you light."
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.120]   No, no, it works like this.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.640]   As he calls, he gives light.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.360]   It is he who gives the power.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.080]   In the call to awaken, we are awakened.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.760]   In the call to rise, we are given power to rise.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.960]   You remember how you see it all in an illustration in Our Lord healing the man with a withered
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.520]   arm.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.800]   There was a man with a withered arm.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.480]   They had done everything they could for him to try to heal him, but nobody could do anything.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:54.120]   Our Lord comes to the man and he says, "Stretch forth thine hand."
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.120]   But the man could not.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.800]   That was his old trouble.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.440]   It was paralyzed, it was helpless.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.680]   What is the point of saying, "Stretch forth thy hand," to a man whose essential trouble
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.400]   is that he cannot stretch forth his hand?
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.400]   The answer is this.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.720]   As the Lord uttered that command, there was power in the command.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.080]   The ability entered with the words, and the man stretched forth his hand.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.880]   Thank God for this.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:27.520]   Were I to believe this morning that I were in the same position as the politicians, in
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.920]   that it is my words only and my arguments and demonstrations alone that matter, I would
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.160]   give up in despair.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.680]   For what we are confronted with is not merely lack of understanding, but natures that are
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:47.520]   warped, twisted, perverted, evil, foul, and above all, under the control of the prince
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.280]   of the power of the air, the devil, the strongman armed that keepeth his goods in peace.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.440]   Who am I or any man to meet such a foe?
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.920]   It would be a hopeless, impossible task.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:07.720]   But the Spirit, the Spirit with the Word, the Spirit of God, the Spirit that brooded
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:12.520]   over the original chaos, and through whom the energy and the power came, saying, "Let
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:17.320]   there be light," and there was light.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.960]   Oh, let us be comforted by this, that as you and I are living this life in the light by
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:30.640]   the power of the Spirit, and as we speak to men and women, it is not merely us, it is
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.760]   not merely our words.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:41.080]   It is the mighty Spirit of God, deigning to use us as instruments and channels, so that
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:48.120]   through us the call comes to a dead soul, "Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.840]   the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee."
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:57.840]   And they hear and they answer, and they come out of the darkness into the light of God,
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:03.760]   streaming from the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.760]   Amen.
