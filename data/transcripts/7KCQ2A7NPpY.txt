[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   what about cancer? Again, nobody wants cancer. Uh, we've all known people who've died of
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.560]   cancer, um, or have had cancer. What can be done to reduce one's risk of cancer?
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.480]   Well, you asked earlier about the numbers. So let's throw some numbers out there, right?
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.360]   So globally we're talking about 11, 12 million deaths per year, about half the number of
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:31.120]   ASCVD, still a staggering number. Um, at the individual level, put it this way, somewhere
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.460]   between one in three and one in four chance, anyone listening to this or watching this
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.600]   is going to get cancer in their lifetime.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.140]   But what's the probability they will die from that cancer?
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.640]   Half of that, about a one in six chance of dying.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.240]   Okay. So is it true that every male gets prostate cancer? Most, in other words, on their deathbed,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.720]   many men will die with prostate cancer and some will die from it. You and I have prostate
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.340]   cancer right now.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.480]   Thank you for informing.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.720]   Yes. Hopefully we will not die of it. We should not die of it. Prostate cancer, colon cancer
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.640]   are cancers that no one should ever die from because they're so easy to screen for. They
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.640]   are so easy to treat when they are in their infancy, um, that it's totally unacceptable
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.560]   that people are dying from this. There are other cancers for which I can't really say
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.440]   that. Breast cancer, much more complicated. Pancreatic cancer, much more complicated.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.120]   Glioblastomae multiforme, much more complicated. So there, you know, as you said a second ago,
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.360]   cancer is not a disease. It is a category of diseases. Each, it's not just that each
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.480]   organ is different and breast differs from pancreatic. It's that within breast cancer,
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.320]   ER, PR positive, HER2/neu positive is a totally different disease from the triple negative
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.360]   breast cancers.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.000]   Those with BRCA mutations or non-BRCA mutations.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.240]   Even putting that aside, just looking at the hormone profile of the individual breast cancers,
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.360]   they're totally different diseases. So it's not just that breast cancer is different from
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.480]   prostate cancer. It's that all breast cancers are quite different.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.080]   Maybe I should frame the question a little differently than given the vast number of
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.720]   different types of cancers and categories within those.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.240]   Your question is still a fair one. I just wanted to throw that caveat out there. So
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.040]   now to your question. Okay. So what do we know? It turns out that we can very comfortably
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:26.120]   speak to several things. One is the role that genes play. So maybe I'll just spend one second
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.280]   on a gene 101 thing for the viewer. We want to differentiate between what are called germline
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:42.800]   mutations and somatic mutations. So your germline and my germline are set. When we were born,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.880]   our germline mutations... Any mutations we have in germline genes are inherited from
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.880]   our parents.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   They're non-negotiable.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:58.060]   They're non-negotiable. You got those things. So question one is how much of cancer results
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.080]   from those types of genetic mutations? And the answer is very little, less than 5%. So
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.520]   very... You mentioned one a moment ago, BRCA. Okay. So mutations in BRCA are germline mutations.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.540]   A woman will get a BRCA mutation from one of her parents. And we will often have a sense
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.120]   of that just from the family history. When mom and sister and aunt and grandmother had
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.120]   breast cancer, you've got a breast cancer gene. Now it might be BRCA. It might be another
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.760]   gene that's not BRCA, but there's no ambiguity. And we test for these genes mostly just for
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.100]   insurance purposes, frankly, but there's no ambiguity that that was a germline transmission
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:49.920]   of a gene that is driving cancer. But 95+% of cancers are not arising from germline mutations.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.860]   They are arising from somatic mutations or acquired mutations. So the question then becomes
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:06.480]   what is driving somatic mutation? And the two clearest indications of drivers of somatic
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.680]   mutation are smoking and obesity. Smoking we've talked about. Let's put that aside for
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.640]   a moment. I'm so surprised about obesity. I don't know why I'm surprised, but I've never
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.400]   heard this. I'm probably just naive to the literature. Yeah. So obesity is now the second
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.240]   most prevalent environmental driver of cancer. Now I will argue, and I think I argue this
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.320]   in the book, hopefully pretty convincingly, I don't think it's obesity per se. I think
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.040]   obesity is just a masquerading proxy. What is obesity? Obesity simply is defined by body
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   mass index. Well, first of all, I don't think I'm obese, but I'm way overweight on BMI.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.920]   You probably are too. So, you know, let's just ignore that. I'm clinically diagnosable
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.300]   as obese. Are you? Oh, no. Well, not clinically. That would be BMI over 30. I don't think you're
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.320]   probably there. No, but if I measure my weight by height... Yeah, yeah, yeah. My BMI is probably
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.400]   27 or 28. Okay. It's been a little while since I've checked. I only know body fat percentages
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.040]   and things like that. So basically, like BMI is a far from perfect proxy, but at the population
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.900]   level, it's what we use. I wish we would get off it, by the way. I think it's really crap.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.480]   Because it doesn't take into account lean versus non-lean tissue. Yeah. I think we could
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.360]   get better data if we looked at waist to height ratio. That's a way better metric. So this
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.240]   is just a quick test for everybody. I'm going to argue your BMI is less relevant to me than
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.960]   your eye color. But if your waist circumference is more than 50% of your height, you should
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.960]   be concerned. Okay. Well, then I'm okay. Yeah, you're fine by that metric, right? But that's
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.180]   important. So if you're six feet tall, your waist better be under 36 inches. And if it's
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:05.080]   over, I would argue that's the definition of obesity, not your BMI being over 30. So
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.720]   back to this issue, because we're using such a crude measurement, it basically is catching
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.680]   a whole bunch of stuff. But the question is, what's driving it? And I think if you really
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:23.980]   look at the physiology of cancer, I don't think it's obesity. I think it's two things
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:31.380]   that come with obesity, insulin resistance, which is two-thirds to three-quarters of obese
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.800]   individuals are insulin resistant, and inflammation. And I think those two things, with the inflammation
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.960]   and the immune dysfunction, with the insulin resistance and the hyper basically tonic growth
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.120]   stimulus that's coming, that's what's driving cancer. So again, is it because a person is
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.800]   storing extra fat and their love handles that that's driving the risk of cancer? No. Those
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   are just two things that are coming along for the ride. So beyond those two things,
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.640]   and along with certain... There are also certain environmental toxins we absolutely know are
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.100]   doing this, right? So we understand that people who have exposure to asbestos have a much
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.360]   higher risk of certain types of lung cancers and things like that. But for the most part,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.480]   those are our big risks. Beyond that, we talk about alcohol in certain cases, absolutely.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:30.360]   Alcohol is a carcinogen. The dose part still isn't clear to me. I don't know, is one drink
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.400]   a day moving the needle much on cancer risk per se? It's not clear.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.960]   And it might depend on those genetic predispositions.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:48.280]   So, yeah, if step one is don't get cancer, you have no control over your genes, you have
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:55.560]   control over smoking, you have control over insulin sensitivity. I wish I could sit here
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:03.860]   and tell you that there is a proven anti-cancer diet, or that if you do X amount of exercise
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:11.080]   per week, you're going to not get cancer. We just don't have a fraction of the control
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.120]   over cancer that we have with cardiovascular disease. We don't understand the disease well
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:23.760]   enough. So we don't understand kind of the initiation process and the propagation process.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.540]   And we have to rely much more on screening.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:37.920]   Are there good whole body screens for cancer? In other words, can I walk into a tube and
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:44.240]   or a cylinder rather, and get screened for the presence of tumors any and everywhere
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.440]   in the body outside the brain? Because the brain is a little harder to get to, right?
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.240]   Believe it or not, the brain is actually pretty easy to screen for.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.120]   Because it's so fatty and floating in water.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.240]   Well, and also the head, when you put the head into an MRI scanner, there's no movement.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.500]   It's the least motion artifact is in the brain. So when you use something called diffusion
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.460]   weighted imaging with background subtraction in an MRI, a technology that was actually
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:12.620]   pioneered in the brain for stroke identification, it's also really good at looking for tumors
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.260]   as well.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:21.220]   So let me make the argument for why screening matters. Because this is, again, kind of an
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:27.060]   area where I go far down a rabbit hole in a way that I think traditional medicine would
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.540]   argue against.
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:37.800]   So my argument for screening is an argument at the individual level. And it goes as follows.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:44.980]   To my knowledge, there is not a single example of a cancer that is more effectively treated
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:51.740]   when the burden of cancer cells in the body is higher than when it is lower.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.260]   So the two examples I think I talk about in the book are colon cancer and breast cancer.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:01.560]   So when you take an individual with stage four colon cancer, that means that the cancer
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:07.180]   has left the colon and is now outside of the colon. So it's usually in the liver at a minimum,
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.860]   potentially in the lungs or in the brain.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:17.380]   That person's five-year survival is very low. Their 10-year survival is zero. We will treat
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:23.920]   them with a very aggressive regimen of multiple drugs. And again, you'll get a five-year survival
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:30.020]   of maybe 10% to 20%. And by 10 years, nobody's alive.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:37.140]   If you take a person with stage three colon cancer, so the colon cancer is big and it's
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:45.140]   even in the lymph nodes around the colon. But at least grossly, you can't see those
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.680]   cells in the liver. Microscopically, of course, we know they're there. Because if you don't
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.520]   treat those patients, they still die of colon cancer. But you whack them with the same chemo
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.180]   regimen that you were going to give the metastatic patients, 80% of those people are alive in
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.820]   five years.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:06.060]   So night and day difference in survival. What's the difference? In the person with metastatic
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:12.660]   cancer, you're treating a person with hundreds of billions of cells. In the adjuvant setting,
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:18.360]   which is what we call it adjuvant when you treat people who have only microscopic disease,
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.660]   you're treating billions of cells. The same is true with breast cancer. So we have the
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:29.100]   clinical trial data to put them side by side. So rule number one is don't get cancer. Rule
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.460]   number two is catch cancer as early as possible if you're going to get it. Which brings us
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:39.660]   to your question of how do you screen for it? We basically screen, the first line of
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:45.680]   screening is imaging, is a sort of visualization. So you have cancers that occur outside the
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.180]   body that you can look at directly. So skin cancer, you can look directly at the skin.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:56.540]   Esophageal, gastric, colon cancer, those are outside the body, right? Mouth to anus embryologically
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:03.100]   is outside the body. So you can put a scope in and you can look directly at the cancer.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.040]   But for all other cancers that are inside the body, yeah, you have to rely on some sort
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.800]   of imaging modality. Although now we're starting to look at things called liquid biopsies.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:16.460]   So blood tests that are looking for cell-free DNA. And the cell-free DNA gives us a sense
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:22.140]   of based on the epigenetic signature of what you're looking at, hey, is there a cancer
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.080]   in the body? And if so, what tissue is it potentially coming from based on these epigenetic
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:34.520]   signatures? So the problem with relying on any one modality is a problem of sensitivity
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.580]   and specificity optimization. Now with MRI scanners, which are in some ways the best
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.640]   way to do this because they don't have radiation. So you don't want to be incurring damage as
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.620]   you do this. The irony of doing a whole body CT scan to screen for cancer is your whole
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:57.760]   body CT scan would be close to 30 to 50 millisieverts of radiation. It's a staggering sum of radiation.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:04.440]   So does that mean that people should, sorry to pull you off this, but I was going to ask
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:09.400]   about this anyway, avoiding going through the whole body scanner at the airport?
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.920]   Noise. So low. So low. Yeah. Going through a whole body scanner at the airport or even
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.440]   getting a DEXA scan. I mean, these are trivial amounts of radiation.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.880]   What about flying? You hear that pilots get more cancer.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.640]   If you're a pilot who's flying over the North Pole back and forth and back and forth, you're
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:34.840]   probably getting, you know, five to 10 millisieverts a year. The NRC suggests that nobody should
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:40.640]   get more than 50 millisieverts a year. So you and I both travel a fair amount, but
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:48.080]   typical travel for the busy person, let's say two round trip flights of more than two
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.400]   hours per month and an international trip every three months.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.320]   Probably still less than a millisievert a year. Yeah. Living at sea level, one millisievert
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.240]   a year, living at a mile elevation. If you lived in Denver, you're at two millisieverts
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.040]   a year. I have to ask standing in front of the microwave.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:12.380]   I'm just, we've got friends. They ask. With or without testes on the counter.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:18.280]   That's an inside joke that unfortunately and fortunately deserves no description. And Peter's
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:24.000]   not referring to me. But people worry about other sources of radiation. So it doesn't
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.600]   sound like the microwave is a concern. What are the other major sources of radiation?
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.160]   I mean, outside of sort of nuclear stuff where things go sadly wrong.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.440]   You live near a plant or there's been a... Yeah, there's been a... It's mostly at the
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.180]   hands of medical professionals, right? It's the CT scanner and the PET scanner are hands
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.280]   down the biggest source of radiation. What about the x-rays at the dentist when
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.280]   they go... They're very low.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.040]   When they scurry behind the wall, put me under the blanket.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:54.720]   They're very low, relatively speaking. Fluoroscopy is very high. They tend to try to cover up
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.760]   all of you that... So for example, if they were doing a fluoroscopic study of your kidney
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.200]   because you had a stone or if you were getting an injection into, you know, if they were
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.280]   doing a fluoroscopic guided injection of one of your discs in your neck, that would be
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.760]   a locally pretty high dose. But they're going to cover the hell out of you elsewhere. And
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.440]   again, if you get one of these things, it's not the end of the world. But boy, I wouldn't
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.280]   want to be getting one a month. And back to the point about screening, you know, a chest
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:28.440]   abdomen pelvis CT scan is probably... I mean, look, there's probably a scanner out there
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.800]   now that's moving fast enough that it's much lower. But I'll give you an example. Okay.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.480]   Remember how I talked about we do CT angiograms on all of our patients for coronary artery
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:44.120]   disease? An off-the-shelf scanner for this is 20 millisieverts of radiation.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.520]   Okay. So calibrate, calibrate me because...
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.920]   That's 40% of your annual allotment.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:55.240]   Oh, wow. So the medical practitioners really are the major culprits here.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:02.160]   That's right. So what we say is, and I think most doctors are now realizing this is, no,
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:08.040]   no, it behooves you to pay a little bit more to go to a really good place that can do that
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:15.280]   scan for two millisieverts. Meaning they have a much faster CT scanner, much better software,
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.800]   and they're better engineers. So they have better engineering that they can do on the
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.680]   scanner to get that done. So if someone listening to this, here's my take. Do not get a CT scan
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.600]   or any imaging study without asking, how much radiation am I seeing? And if a person can't
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.320]   tell you how many millisieverts of radiation you're being exposed to, then just say, I'm
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.840]   going to wait a minute until somebody can tell me that.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.400]   I realize...
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.680]   And keep in mind, if 50 is the most you should ever be exposed to in a year, there better
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.200]   be a damn good reason why I'm going to get 25 in a day. Now, there are some people who
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.680]   have to do this. If you're a cancer patient and they're scanning you as a part of your
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:17:00.120]   treatment, you have to pick and choose between those two opportunities. So I also don't want
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.880]   to create some fear mongering where, oh my God, if you hit 50 in a year, you're hosed.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.840]   No, it's just I wouldn't want to hit 50 a year every year for my whole life. And I certainly
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.920]   wouldn't want to be hitting hundreds a year for any period of time.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.840]   I think we're just trying to raise awareness and also calibrate people to what the sources
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:31.640]   are and so they can make good choices, not to place them into a chronic state of fear.
