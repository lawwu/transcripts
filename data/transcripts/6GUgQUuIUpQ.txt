[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   Well, do each of my sins cost me an eternal reward?
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.280]   Are we caught in a race to outweigh our sins by our good deeds in order to preserve any
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.560]   level of rewards that we may have in heaven?
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.240]   It's a question today from a listener named Brandon.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.280]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.480]   I know the Bible talks about rewards in heaven in the form of crowns.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.800]   I want the most joy in heaven I possibly can in the life to come.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.680]   But in this life, I feel like I'm constantly sinning.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.160]   And every time I sin, I feel like my eternal rewards slip from my fingers.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.280]   I can never get ahead, always returning back to a balance of zero.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.800]   At this rate, there won't be any rewards for me in heaven left.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.120]   Or is my thinking here backwards?
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.000]   Pastor John, can you help me understand this?"
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.440]   Well, it's right to want the most joy possible in heaven if the aim is to be satisfied in
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:18.280]   God himself supremely with the gifts of his grace as secondary echoes of his excellence
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.840]   that then we enjoy for that reason.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.760]   So amen to that.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.400]   And I can confirm to Brandon that he not only feels he is sinning every day, he is.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.160]   I can confirm that analysis.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.280]   And so are all of us.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.400]   None of us loves God perfectly the way we should.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.000]   In our best deeds, there is something to regret.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.040]   So so far so good in Brandon's thinking.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.960]   And then things start to go haywire.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:00.080]   He says, "Every time I sin, I feel like my eternal rewards slip from my fingers.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.720]   I can never get ahead, always returning back to a balance of zero."
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   Hmm.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.840]   Now, in this way of talking, I think he reveals a serious mistake in his understanding of
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.160]   the Bible.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.680]   The mistake seems to be this.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:31.080]   Rewards are given, he would say, he seems to imply, rewards are given not for each good
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.080]   deed but only for the good deeds whose number surpasses the number of bad deeds.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.440]   In other words, if you do five good deeds and four bad deeds, you get a reward for one
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.840]   good deed.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.720]   And if you do five good deeds and five more bad deeds, five or more, he says, these are
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.600]   his words, you're back to a balance of zero.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.440]   Now, I'm not sure where he's getting this notion that rewards are parceled out this
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.520]   way.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.360]   But let me cite some passages from the Bible to show I don't think that's right.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.200]   There's a very different way of thinking about rewards for good deeds than in this
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.040]   kind of ledger approach.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.620]   Let's start with Matthew 10, 41.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.880]   The one who receives a prophet—that's P-R-O-P-H-E-T—the one who receives a prophet
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.440]   because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.760]   person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward, and
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.840]   whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.280]   because he is a disciple, truly I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.200]   Now, there's no hint here that if later in the day, after you give the cup of cold
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.480]   water to a disciple because you love his Christ-exalting ministry, you speak harshly, say, to your
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.400]   child.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.240]   No hint, I say, that you will therefore lose your reward for the good deed of giving a
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.040]   drink of water to the disciple.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.000]   It says you will by no means lose your reward.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.480]   Now, of course, if you prove yourself to be an unbeliever by a life of sustained lovelessness,
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.280]   then even your good deeds are not good deeds because they're not coming from faith.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.160]   But if you are a believer, the good deed, the work of faith that you do in the morning
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.080]   is not canceled out by the failure of patience in the afternoon.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.680]   That's not the way Jesus is thinking or anybody else in the New Testament.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.240]   Or consider 1 Corinthians 3, 13, "Each one's work will become manifest, for the
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.960]   day will disclose it because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.800]   of work each one has done.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.640]   If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.480]   But if anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved,
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.480]   but only as through fire."
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.960]   Now, what's plain here is that fire is not an accountant.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:42.480]   Fire is not counting up numbers of good deeds and bad deeds, or in this case, solid teachings
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   and useless teachings.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.480]   I think that's the context of what good deeds he's talking about.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.680]   Fire doesn't work that way, right?
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.960]   It doesn't count.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.760]   Fire doesn't count.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.200]   It just consumes wood, hay, and stubble.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:03.600]   It consumes useless, harmful works or teachings, which by implication means it does not consume
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.320]   useful, good, righteous works or teachings.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.160]   They survive the fire.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.560]   And presumably, they survive no matter how many bad works got burned up in the fire.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.040]   If we're true believers, the good works survive.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.160]   The biblical picture of the judgment of Christians is not like Brandon's picture of counting
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.680]   up bad deeds and counting up good deeds and only rewarding the good deeds if there are
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.040]   more of them than bad deeds.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   That's not a biblical picture of judgment.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:49.160]   Or consider Ephesians 6:8, "We know that whatever good anyone does, whatever good anyone
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:57.040]   does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a bondservant or free."
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.440]   No mention here that he really won't receive back for doing the good deed if there are
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.440]   more bad deeds.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.520]   He won't.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.600]   Or consider Luke 14:13, "When you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.160]   lame, the blind, and you will be blessed because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.040]   at the resurrection of the just."
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.960]   So if one Thanksgiving dinner, one Thanksgiving, you invite lots of international students
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.160]   and maybe some older folks who don't have any family nearby and maybe a homeless man
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.800]   that you met on the street, you invite them to Thanksgiving dinner and you share your
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:44.360]   bounty joyfully with them in the name of Jesus, it says you will be repaid at the resurrection
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.800]   of the just.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:55.700]   And that is true, even if the next Thanksgiving you are in a bad place spiritually and selfishly
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.720]   let the opportunity go by.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.580]   Thanksgiving number two gets burned up.
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.480]   Thanksgiving number one is rewarded at the resurrection.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.960]   Here's the principle behind this way of thinking.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   Good works in the life of a Christian are rewarded because they are beautiful and their
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:29.520]   beauty is owing to the beauty of God's regenerating and sanctifying grace in the life of the Christian.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:37.320]   We are able to do what is truly good only because God caused us to be born again, made
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:44.000]   us spiritually alive, and because his Spirit goes on working in us what is pleasing in
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.820]   his sight, Hebrews 13:21.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:56.520]   The rewards are God's way of confirming that we are truly born again, truly in Christ,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.240]   truly the children of God.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:07.040]   It's so crucial never to forget Ephesians 2, 8-10, "By grace you have been saved through
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   faith."
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.920]   It is not your own doing.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:18.720]   It is the gift of God, gift of God, gift of God, not of works, so that nobody will boast
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.220]   when the rewards are passed out.
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.080]   For we are his workmanship, not ours.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.360]   We're not writing our own poem.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.440]   Created in Christ, created by God.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.880]   We don't create ourselves for good works and even the good works God prepared beforehand
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.880]   that we should walk in.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:43.180]   I mean, the point of that text is to get God, God, God as the source and goal of all of
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.080]   our good deeds.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:52.880]   So when we are rewarded for those good works, it is the workmanship of God that is being
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:10:01.240]   celebrated, and that workmanship does not cease to be properly rewarded because there
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.920]   are other remaining sins in our lives.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.360]   Amazingly freeing word, Pastor John.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   Thank you.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.100]   And Brandon, thank you for the clear question.

[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.720]   Well on Monday we're going to return with a question about quarantine habits.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.400]   We've all had a lot of time at home these days, and this question coming up is searching.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.480]   It's a searching question from a young woman who wants to know what her quarantine entertainment
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.880]   habits are revealing about the state of her own soul.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.200]   Why when she's most afraid of what's going on in the world, why does she most often turn
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.440]   to Netflix?
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.680]   That's queued up for us on Monday.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.940]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.940]   Have a great weekend.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.240]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:11.980]   [end]
