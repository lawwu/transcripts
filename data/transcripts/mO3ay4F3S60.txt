[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020]   You've estimated that we'll have AGI by 2030.
[00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.300]   How will we actually know that we got there?
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.260]   And what may be, quote, move 37 of AGI?
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.820]   So I think there's the sort of blanket testing
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.900]   to just make sure you've got the consistency.
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.220]   But I think there are the sort of lighthouse moments
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.140]   like the move 37 that I would be looking for.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.460]   So one would be inventing a new conjecture
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.180]   or a new hypothesis about physics like Einstein did.
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.380]   So maybe you could even run the back test of that very rigorously,
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.220]   like have a cutoff of knowledge cutoff of 1900
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.480]   and then give the system everything that was, you know,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.060]   that was written up to 1900 and then see if it could come up
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.380]   with special relativity and general relativity, right?
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.160]   Like Einstein did.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.780]   That would be an interesting test.
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.800]   Another one would be, can it invent a game like Go?
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.620]   Not just come up with move 37, a new strategy,
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.680]   but can it invent a game that's as deep, as aesthetically beautiful,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.140]   as elegant as Go?
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.160]   And those are the sorts of things I would be looking out for.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.700]   And probably a system being able to do several of those things, right?
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.180]   For it to be very general, not just one domain.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.440]   And so I think that would be the signs,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.140]   at least that I would be looking for,
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.920]   that we've got a system that's AGI level.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.760]   And then maybe to fill that out,
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.340]   you would also check the consistency,
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.520]   you know, make sure there's no holes in that system either.
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.920]   And you would be in the room for that probably two or three months
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.440]   before announcing it.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.160]   And you would just be sitting there trying not to tweet.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.280]   Something like that.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.000]   Exactly.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.340]   It's like, what is this amazing new, you know, physics idea?
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.700]   And then we would probably check it with world experts in that domain,
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.900]   right, and validate it and kind of go through its workings.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.280]   And it would be explaining its workings to,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.640]   yeah, be an amazing moment.
