[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.000]   I will just quickly introduce Jonathan Clements,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.200]   who in turn will introduce Charlie.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.160]   Jonathan was on the last panel.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.640]   He is a former Wall Street Journal columnist.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.400]   I will say for me as a young analyst working at Morningstar,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.640]   he was my favorite part of the journal
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.400]   and really very much influenced my own career path to talk more
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.920]   about personal finance and financial planning.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.720]   And has the Humble Dollar blog and also was involved
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.920]   in a great book project, a book I just love that has come
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.160]   out over the past year called My Money Journey, which is essays
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.120]   by people about how they found their own financial footing.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.520]   So Jonathan, if you can come up here and introduce Charlie
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.160]   or do you want to sit tight?
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.840]   Okay, great.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.080]   Thanks, Jonathan.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.720]   >> Good morning, everybody.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.320]   I moved back to the United States from London in 1986
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.800]   and I became a reporter at Forbes Magazine,
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.400]   which meant that basically I was a glorified fact checker.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.240]   I spent the next two years of my life trying to make sure
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.400]   that the senior writers didn't make too many errors
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.000]   in the magazine.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.560]   But one of the nice things about the job was
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.760]   that you had a certain amount of free time.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.760]   And Forbes also at the time had a great library.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.200]   And that's where I got my personal finance education.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.360]   And going through the stacks down in the second floor library,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.760]   I came across this book called Investment Policy.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.120]   Now, Charlie, that really wasn't a very catchy title, was it?
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.440]   Investment Policy was a book that came out in 1985,
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.200]   but it really grew out of a financial analyst journal article
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.640]   that appeared a decade earlier in 1975 called The Loser's Game.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.000]   And it was, of course, written by Charlie Ellis.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.600]   So, Charlie, tell us a little bit about the story behind
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   that essay and how it evolved
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.160]   into what's become a phenomenally selling book,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.280]   Winning the Loser's Game.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.880]   >> Do you mind if I take just a minute and go
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.600]   in another direction and then come back?
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.160]   >> You know, you are a difficult individual, I know,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.960]   but go ahead.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.280]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.400]   >> I'm looking out at this really large audience.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.000]   And those of you who I've met obviously have certain
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.520]   characteristics.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.960]   I'd like you to think just for a minute about Jack Bogle,
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   how he had a nightmare and he had a dream.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.680]   His nightmare was that he would be forgotten.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.200]   And it really, really mattered to Jack that he not be forgotten.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.760]   As he told me, the only reason I'm really writing books is
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.840]   so I might not be forgotten, at least for a while.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.240]   But I'm really, really worried about being forgotten.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.720]   And if you look at this group or walk the hallway
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.680]   or that lovely sign out front with Jack's picture,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.760]   you realize, oh, Jack, you may be gone,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.440]   but you're certainly not forgotten.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.960]   The second thing --
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.520]   [ Applause ]
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.520]   The second thing is, Jack was a real tightwad,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.800]   and he made a celebration out of being stingy and cheap.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.040]   And how he would take personal [inaudible]
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.720]   to save a couple of nickels.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.680]   He would be thrilled.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.320]   This is the first time in 50 years that I've been
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.800]   in a public speaking situation with no fee whatsoever.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   [ Laughter ]
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.400]   [ Applause ]
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.840]   So back to your question.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.200]   I happen to love tennis as a game.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.080]   It doesn't take very long to get there.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.800]   You can play for as long as you feel like,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.240]   and then you've got plenty of time left
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.520]   over for the rest of your day.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.360]   Whereas golfers, it takes a while to get there,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.160]   and it's a long, long game,
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.240]   particularly if the weather's nice a little bit.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.680]   And you don't have much time.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:50.160]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.000]   >> I wish I were a really gifted tennis player, but I'm not.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.800]   And so I was attracted to the idea
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.200]   that tennis is a overcoming problems game,
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.080]   rather than a doing brilliant things game.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.160]   Wonderful man named Simon Rameau,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.840]   who more than anyone else invented the American space
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.040]   program as the chief executive officer
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.000]   of GRW Thompson Rameau Wooldridge.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.920]   He conceptualized what space could be all about,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.320]   and made clear in such a way that Congress
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.640]   and the administration really understood this is something
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.840]   we've got to do in a major way.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.960]   It was a very talented business executive.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.960]   Much more important to him, he was a gifted musician.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.800]   He and three members of the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.040]   performed in public as a string quartet quite often,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.560]   and took on some very complicated pieces of music.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.560]   Finally, he was also a terrific athlete,
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.440]   and his favorite game was also tennis.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.360]   And he wrote a book called Extraordinary Tennis
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.160]   for the Ordinary Tennis Player.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.280]   That's me, ordinary tennis player.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.520]   So I bought the book, and it was a mind-opening experience for me.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.760]   The purpose of the game, for those of you who are expert,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.640]   is to hit a shot that goes so close to the line
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.000]   that the other person can't quite get it back, or is hit so hard
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.160]   that the other person has put a little bit on their back foot,
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.440]   or in a series of shots has them running back and forth
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.400]   across the court trying to keep up with you,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.000]   and gradually you get ahead of them
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.320]   and slam it through into the corner.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.880]   That's what experts do.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.600]   They win points.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.400]   The rest of us, the outcome of the game
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.120]   is determined almost entirely by who loses the most.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.160]   And I thought, that's my kind of game.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.720]   I double fault sometimes.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.280]   I hit it in the net sometimes.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.760]   I hit it out of bounds sometimes with the least intention.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.520]   I never wanted to do any of those things, but they do happen.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.520]   And if I could cut back on those mistakes,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.160]   sure enough, I'd have a better outcome.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.360]   One of his recommendations was hit the serve always,
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.520]   first serve and second serve,
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.160]   that is about as good as you can do and get in 80% of the time.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.040]   If you do that, you will double fault once or twice in a set,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.600]   and that's all.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.920]   And your second serve will keep the other player
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.840]   back in the court and on defense.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.320]   It's a magical insight.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.960]   And I tried it, and it worked for me.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.440]   And I had a wonderful time.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.000]   So I realized, my God, this is a brilliant understanding,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.280]   and it applies entirely to investment management.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.080]   If we could just eliminate our dumbhead mistakes,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.840]   if we could just avoid making,
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.320]   "I'm terrified I'm getting out of the market at the wrong time,"
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.720]   or, "I'm excited as could be about this is a really opportunity
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.400]   at the wrong time," we would do fine.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.040]   And so that's the origin of the book.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.320]   -So that was the origin of the book,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.240]   but you wrote the original essay in 1975.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.360]   -Right.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.040]   -And by the way, Charlie, thanks to Wikipedia,
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.040]   I can tell you it's about to turn 86.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.960]   -Next week. -Next week.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.040]   I won't sing "Happy Birthday" to you because...
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.760]   [ Applause ]
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.560]   But Charlie wrote "Winning the Loser's Game"
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.240]   half a century -- the original article half a century ago.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.000]   And at the time, you had spent a considerable period
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.400]   covering analysts with Donaldson, Lufkin, Genrette.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.040]   -Right. -And you had seen
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.440]   how well they did, the analysts,
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.480]   and that gave you an insight
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.320]   into the performance-management game
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.560]   and how it was a loser's game.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   Can you talk a little bit about that?
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.800]   -Well, one of the great privileges
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.400]   of being a stockbroker is you get to meet a lot of people.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.560]   And if you're in the institutional business,
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.560]   you meet a lot of people at major institutions.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.240]   And I was responsible for all of our clients
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.000]   in Northern Manhattan and Boston and Chicago.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.640]   And Boston was a hotbed of talented people.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.000]   And one of the things you couldn't help but realize
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.520]   is these guys are all really good at what they're doing.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.880]   They're all smart as the dickens.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.720]   They've got terrific good education.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.840]   And, boy, they're fiercely competitive.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.760]   Second thing you learned is they're all fighting
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.200]   against each other, and they don't realize
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.760]   that they're competing with each other.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.200]   And that's pretty tough competition
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.120]   because they're all really smart,
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.800]   and they're all really well-educated,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.080]   and they're all highly motivated,
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.360]   and they're competing with each other.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.680]   That's not going to work out all that well for all of them.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.760]   And sooner or later,
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.680]   people are going to have real difficulty.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.000]   And that was, for me, a really opening-minding insight
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.680]   that just they are not trying to compete with the market.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.120]   They're competing with each other.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.560]   The market, you can look at it and say,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.360]   "Ah, you know, it's just the market."
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.840]   But when you're competing with brilliantly talented people
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.440]   with great educations and all ferocious ambition
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.360]   to beat you back, this is a different game.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.240]   - So when you wrote the 1975 piece
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.200]   for the "Financial Analyst Journal,"
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.360]   what sort of reception did it get
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.840]   among people on Wall Street?
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.680]   - Oh, they loved it.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.200]   - They thought that they were playing a loser's game.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.040]   - They loved it.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.000]   I got so many friendly remarks.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.680]   I read your article.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.840]   Of course, you're wrong,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.880]   but I thought your article was beautifully written
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.160]   or it was fun or your analogy was really terrific,
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.760]   but you're wrong.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.840]   I'm going to beat the dickens out of the market
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.680]   and this is how I'm going to make my living.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.120]   You really are wrong.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.480]   So far, the evidence seems to be going the other way.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.040]   And the game's not over yet.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.600]   It's a long, long, long, long game.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.920]   But the evidence keeps building
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:16.720]   that active investment managers, as talented as they are,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.120]   and I have to tell you,
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.640]   we have never in the world had such a talented group
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.520]   as we have now, active management practitioners.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.160]   Incredible.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.080]   We have never had as much equipment for them to use.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.040]   The computing power that they carry around in their pockets
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.480]   is way beyond anything that could have been imagined
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.680]   30, 40, 50 years ago.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.960]   The information flows that go to them
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.520]   from thousands and thousands of analysts
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.880]   and portfolio managers and economic analysts
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.440]   and strategists from all over the world,
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.160]   all day, every day through the internet is unbelievable.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.960]   If you haven't played with the Bloomberg terminals
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.400]   in the last couple of years,
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.640]   find an opportunity to go play with the loop terminal.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.800]   They are unbelievably powerful.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.440]   Only problem is everybody's got them.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.040]   Everybody has a Bloomberg terminal.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.160]   Most people have two, one at home and one at work.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160]   A lot of people have three, one at home, one at work,
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.840]   and one in the car that drives them into work.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:26.160]   The information is not competitive.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.280]   The computing power is not competitive.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.400]   The talent and education is not competitive.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.880]   It is overwhelming.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.280]   And they're still out there struggling away,
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.240]   hoping to find a way to be able to do better
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.480]   than the competition.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.080]   The analogy that comes to my mind is,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.080]   if you are 6'2" and you're 24,
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.720]   and you are a damn good athlete,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.840]   and you've had some experience as a prize fighter,
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.000]   and you and I meet each other somewhere out here
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.560]   in the hallway, and it's a competition,
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.160]   I know who's gonna lose.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.120]   It's gonna happen for sure.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.880]   But change things a little bit.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.280]   You've got a knife and I've got a knife.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.960]   I might be good with a knife.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.880]   No, no, you've got a gun.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.080]   Well, I've got a gun.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.160]   Yeah, but you might have a killer instinct,
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.720]   and I might flinch at the idea of killing somebody
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.000]   with a handgun.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.760]   No, you've got a machine gun and I've got a machine gun.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.920]   Who gives a damn about you being 6'2"?
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.280]   You've got a tank and I've got a tank.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.600]   Nobody cares about the fact you're 22, 6'2",
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.000]   and you're a prize fighter.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.840]   That's what's happened to the investment management world.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.200]   The power of the tools that are available
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.120]   to the people who are doing the work
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.600]   have gone up and up and up,
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.760]   and all of them, for the individual, are marvelous.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.520]   You should see what I've got in the way of technology.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.680]   You should see what I've got in the way of information.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.800]   Only problem is, everybody else has it too,
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.640]   and exactly the same time.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.840]   So they're equalizers.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.760]   They make all of us more and more and more equal.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.960]   And if you think the market's gonna do 7% a year
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   and you've got a 1% fee, that's a 15% of returns fee.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.240]   That's gonna be really hard to overcome
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.400]   by outsmarting the other people,
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.000]   smart as they are, hardworking as they are,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.080]   all over the world.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.400]   - So just to give you some historical context,
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:49.280]   when Charlie's original essay came out in 1975,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.280]   that was before Jack opened the S&P 500 fund
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.000]   to investors in 1976.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.440]   So when you hear Charlie talk about his essay
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.520]   and the reception that it received,
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.240]   remember, this was radical in the mid-1970s.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.000]   This was stuff that people on Wall Street
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.960]   not only didn't want to believe, simply didn't believe.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.200]   They really did believe that they were better than average.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.000]   So Charlie launched a firm called Greenwich Associates,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.280]   which was a management consultancy firm.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.120]   And in 1976, I think I've got this right,
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.600]   he had a fateful lunch with a man
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.840]   by the name of Sandy Getzman.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.400]   And this is the point at which you realize
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.680]   that Charlie is a complete fraud
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.080]   and is in fact a brilliant active investor.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.880]   So tell us about the lunch, Charlie.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.480]   - Sandy Getzman was the chief executive
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   of a firm called First Manhattan.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.240]   And they had been clients the year before.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.640]   And I've written, as we did for each client,
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.880]   an analysis of their strengths and weaknesses
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.360]   with a series of three, four, five specific recommendations
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.000]   as to what they should do differently.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.880]   They had some terrific research
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.000]   for creative investment ideas.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.560]   They did not have institutional or industry coverage.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.080]   They didn't do it that way.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.900]   They were looking for individual stocks
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.280]   rather than wanting to be responsible
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.360]   for all the stocks in the chemical industry
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.440]   or all the stocks in the auto industry
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.180]   or any other industry.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.320]   And I've explained to them quite carefully
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.880]   that they were working in a way
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.520]   that was counterproductive because brilliance
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.160]   in creative ideas, without having the full understanding
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.800]   and context of the total industry,
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.920]   they were going to miss the privilege
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.560]   of being listened to carefully
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.320]   by the analysts at the institutions.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.360]   And all the institutions had analysts
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   who covered their industry and then found the best ideas
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.680]   and fed them up to the portfolio managers.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.120]   And as a result, they were never gonna have access
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.160]   to the portfolio managers.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.280]   And they were going to never be able
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.880]   to build a significant institutional business.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.120]   This is some way to treat a client.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.800]   You're making a terrible mistake
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.060]   and you're really in trouble.
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.720]   I called the next year to see
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.920]   if I could make an appointment to see Sandy.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.640]   And his assistant said,
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.480]   "Well, Mr. Gottesman would like very much to see you,
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.580]   "but he would like very much that you would come for lunch."
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.480]   And I thought, this is gonna be terrific
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.840]   'cause we just told him he's doing everything wrong
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.440]   and he has decided to upgrade my stature
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.520]   and invite me to come in for lunch.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.200]   This is going to be a guaranteed win.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.800]   So I went in and with all the politeness I could set us,
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.400]   Sandy just delighted with this conversation,
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.580]   looking forward to it very much.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.700]   He said, "Before we get in the conversation, Charlie,
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.780]   "let me just tell you,
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.940]   "we're never gonna take your service again.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.940]   "You told us that we couldn't succeed with what we're doing
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.280]   "and we understand that you're right.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.180]   "We can't succeed with most institutional investors,
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.640]   "but that's only part of our business.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.020]   "We do a lot of investment management
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:23.020]   "and we do individual stock brokerage for individual people.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.860]   "We don't need institutional business.
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.780]   "That's a small sideline."
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.780]   Look, ooh-wee, why would he invite me to come in
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.420]   if that's what he has as a message?
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.100]   Most people would send a short message,
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.960]   "You're wrong for us
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.700]   "and we don't want anything to do with you,"
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.500]   or a telephone call or some other.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.420]   But here he's invited me in for lunch.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.980]   Well, Sandy, we've got this really interesting service
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.860]   for investment management.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.900]   Would you like to know how you're doing
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.460]   compared to other investment managers?
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.620]   No, Charlie, we don't really care about that
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.220]   because most people are going after the large pension funds.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.700]   We're going after the small pension funds
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.820]   run by entrepreneurs.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.100]   So we don't really care about that business.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.820]   Ooh-wee, this is gonna be a difficult situation.
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.780]   I said, "Okay."
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.340]   Sandy said, "Well, let's go up for lunch."
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.580]   Then as we got in the elevator,
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.100]   I realized I've got to come up with something
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.340]   to talk about over lunch
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.580]   because he has just shot down the two possibilities
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.620]   I had on the way in.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.000]   As we sat down, I said,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.460]   "Sandy, you're one of the best investors anybody knows.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.340]   "Would you talk about your favorite all-time investment?"
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.220]   Said, "Sure."
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.540]   Said, "First, what was it?"
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.020]   Still is.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.020]   "What is it?"
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:51.860]   Berkshire.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.540]   I'm sorry, Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.780]   Oh, I'd heard about Berkshire Hathaway
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.580]   and I'd heard about Warren Buffett
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.460]   and I knew something about the Buffett partnership,
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.500]   but I didn't really know very much about it at all.
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.780]   So I said, "Sandy, can you do me a big favor?
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.740]   "Would you talk in depth about Berkshire Hathaway?
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.660]   "Start by telling me how long you're going to own it."
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.780]   "Forever."
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:25.740]   I had had a conversation with my partners
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.260]   that we were running a fragile business.
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.300]   We were a small firm.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.180]   We couldn't possibly borrow any money from a bank.
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.460]   So if we had any trouble financially,
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.860]   we were in serious jeopardy, probably wiped out.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.820]   And that we ought to put aside a reserve,
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.020]   which we could do if we would defer our annual bonus
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.220]   by six months.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.820]   And the other fellows in the partnership said,
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.300]   "You know, I really don't want to do that
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.060]   "'cause I'm almost hand to mouth,
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.180]   "but yeah, I think that's a really good idea.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.300]   "We'll put it aside."
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.100]   So we had $100,000 that we had decided
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.140]   would be enough of a safety cushion
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.620]   in case we got in trouble.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.700]   And my partners had said,
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.580]   "Charlie, you know something about investing,
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.580]   "so why don't we look to you to find
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.540]   "how we should invest this?"
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.900]   I said, "Fine, I'll gladly do it."
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.420]   So it was that background,
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.900]   Sandy started talking about Berkshire Hathaway
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.220]   and laid out a concept of why
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.620]   that was a great long-term investment
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.660]   that was compelling in my mind.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.260]   So I went back to my partners and said,
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.700]   "I think we should put everything into Berkshire Hathaway."
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.060]   What the hell is Berkshire Hathaway?
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.460]   I'd never heard of it.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.900]   You will hear about it.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.340]   It's a really, really well-run investment organization
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.940]   and it's diversified
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.860]   and it's in fairly conservative stocks most of the time
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.980]   and it's got some really clever ideas
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.220]   about how to do better.
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.180]   Well, that was a long time ago
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:06.180]   and the stock was selling a little over $1,000 a share
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.020]   in the A shares.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.500]   There's nothing like being lucky.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.300]   - And today, Berkshire, what?
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.620]   Around half a million a share?
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.740]   - Yeah.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.060]   - And do you still own it?
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.220]   - I'm following Sandy's advice.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.820]   He said, "Forever."
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.740]   And I figured, why not?
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.220]   It's forever with me too
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.020]   and now, of course, it'd be stupid to sell it
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.420]   and pay the capital gains.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.580]   You'd never recover it at my age
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.900]   before you're gone and buried.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.220]   So I'm looking at it sort of like a flower bond.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.580]   Those of you who are in your early, mid-80s
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.860]   will understand flower bonds
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.060]   were the bonds that you could use
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.180]   to pay off your estate taxes.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.860]   They were bargained and the price is up
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.860]   and stuff like that.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.220]   - So I wanna move on to another part
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.740]   of Charlie's story career.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.260]   Charlie spent 17 years
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.180]   heading up the investment committee for Yale University.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.660]   - I was on the investment committee for 17 years
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.100]   and I was chair for 11.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.340]   - Which means that basically, Charlie,
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.340]   was David Swenson's boss.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.180]   - No, no, I was sitting in the front row seat
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.980]   watching the best talent
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.620]   that any of us have ever, ever known of.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.620]   - So tell us about David.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.660]   - He's a beautiful man.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.500]   He was good-looking.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.620]   He was a good athlete.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.780]   He was as nice a guy as you would ever want to meet.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.420]   He was the most disciplined investor
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.780]   there has ever been.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.740]   Everything about his activities
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.380]   were worked out and done deliberately.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:56.420]   His greatest personal strength as an investor
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.140]   was his fascination with risk management.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.540]   Most of us think risk will take care of itself.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.220]   Not David, he really wanted to manage the risk
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.340]   very, very carefully.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.660]   Before he got to Yale,
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.660]   he had invented the first major derivative transaction.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.620]   $100 million swap between floating rate and fixed rate
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.740]   interest between IBM and the World Bank.
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.220]   Nobody had ever conceived of doing anything quite like
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.460]   that kind of a transaction.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.660]   He conceived of it and then figured out
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.380]   who would be the right clients to do the transaction with.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.380]   And then of course, the fee was pretty attractive
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.700]   on both sides.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.020]   Then at Salomon Brothers,
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.860]   which is where he was then employed,
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.860]   it was a spellbinding experience
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.820]   to see somebody do something creative.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:52.820]   David invented the endowment model concept of investing,
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.660]   which is probably the most powerful development
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.940]   of thinking in investment management.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.780]   That anybody has ever done except possibly indexing,
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.540]   which I'm devoted to, so be careful, there's a bias there.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:15.620]   When he got to Yale, New Haven, I have to tell you,
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.620]   New Haven is somewhere between New York and Boston.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.140]   Boston's a hotbed of talent.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.780]   New York's a hotbed of talent.
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.980]   Nobody needs to have some place to live and work
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.300]   that's halfway between the two cities.
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.620]   And that's what New Haven was.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.020]   They had no investment community
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.900]   of any kind of distinction or capability.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.540]   There was no way that somebody who was really good
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.620]   was gonna leave Wall Street or Boston
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.140]   in order to get a job in New Haven.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:46.140]   And it was sort of the desert of investment management.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:56.660]   He was sole responsible for the endowment.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.060]   And his starting place was to create
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.380]   the first really serious-minded investment committee
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.820]   that Yale had ever had, which is an interesting challenge.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.260]   He put together one after another after another
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.220]   first-rate insights into how you could do one thing
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.380]   after another after another after another.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.540]   If you really wanted to have a talented investment team,
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.260]   fine, start with someone who is a gifted teacher,
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:32.100]   David Swensen, ask him to create a seminar
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.300]   that the smartest students at Yale will all want to take.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.180]   And Yale has not a very large undergraduate college,
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.860]   but a little over a thousand students per year.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.100]   But they are really the cat's meow
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:52.100]   in terms of talent and creativity and ability to learn.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.740]   Have a seminar that all of those students
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.660]   are gonna want to apply for.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.020]   Carefully select the 25 students
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.740]   you will allow into the seminar.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.460]   Within the seminar, make it spellbinding experience
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.140]   of learning and development.
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:13.700]   Choose the one or two or three students each year
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.260]   who are really outstanding
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.380]   and offer them a summer internship.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.140]   If someone is in the summer,
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.100]   proves that they are really gifted at doing the work,
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:30.100]   offer them a two or three year extended position.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.780]   And if they are really, really good
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.260]   in that two or three years,
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.420]   offer them a chance to stay permanent on the team.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.100]   Oh, by the way, make it fun.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.260]   Lots of activities in sports
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.340]   because Yale's got all kinds of sports equipment
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.260]   and facilities and David's a very good athlete.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.940]   Have really interesting competitions,
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.380]   with other teams.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:56.500]   Be sure that you have group activities
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.660]   that are very close-knit, bring people together
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.820]   so that they realize this is like a family.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:07.260]   Be sure that they have a chance to learn an enormous amount
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.260]   because they're included in all the most important meetings
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:15.060]   and they participate in the decision after the meetings.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.660]   Pretty soon you can attract,
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.980]   particularly in a scuttlebutt network,
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.860]   passes the word, students pass it on to other students,
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.900]   pass it on to other students.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.940]   So it didn't take more than two or three years
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.940]   before everybody at Yale knew
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.540]   the best thing you could possibly do
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.420]   is get into David Swenson's seminar.
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.220]   So it attracted quite a large group
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.140]   and then he carefully selected the best of those students
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.820]   to be members of his seminar and then took it from there.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.900]   - So in terms of the investment committee overseeing--
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:44.740]   - Same thing.
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.860]   - David Swenson, I mean, was it like the cop
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.260]   with the presidential motorcade,
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.740]   you just waved it through
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.860]   or did you ever second guess David's decisions?
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.620]   - Well, first David did the selection
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.660]   of investment committee.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.980]   He did not just take whatever was offered.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.220]   He was very careful to find a cluster of people,
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.500]   really small number of people,
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.100]   but a cluster of people with different backgrounds
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.140]   who would really be committed to helping the Yale endowment
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.420]   and who would be sources of insight and information
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.260]   and perspective and judgment
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.340]   that he might be able to incorporate.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.620]   So it was his investment committee without a doubt.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.700]   And then he treated them as though they were gods
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.660]   and they gradually thought themselves
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.860]   as being pretty close to gods
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.540]   with David as their favorite employee.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.300]   The intensity back and forth was quite terrific.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.820]   Lots of open discussion.
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.780]   Only once in 17 years did I see a recommendation
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.180]   from David's team come up
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.980]   and meet a series of skeptical questions
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.700]   from the investment committee,
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.980]   at which point David said,
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.580]   I think what we ought to do is take this back
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.020]   for further consideration.
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.720]   Of course, it never came up again.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.620]   Once in 17 years, and if you look at the Yale endowment,
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.700]   it had over a hundred different investment managers,
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.740]   most of whom none of us would recognize by name.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:17.820]   There was no well-known investment management firm
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.940]   that ever made the cut
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.100]   in David Swenson's array of investment management
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.100]   because he was reaching for people who were so talented,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.480]   but so new that nobody knew about them
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.540]   or would feel comfortable hiring them.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.740]   He was the first client for a very large number,
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.460]   quite successful later on investments.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.420]   He was very good at it and that helped,
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.820]   but he caught people at just the right time.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.700]   And then the interesting thing to me was,
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.540]   even though I would not have recognized four out of five
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.620]   of those managers,
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.700]   and I've got a reasonably wide exposure
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:56.980]   in the investment management world,
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.620]   I just didn't know them at all.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:05.100]   The average duration of the relationships was 17 years.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.420]   Imagine that, that the average duration
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.020]   of the investment manager relationship turnover
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:18.940]   was what, 6%, it's just phenomenal.
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.140]   - So when I was hurriedly sketching notes
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.300]   for today's conversation with Charlie,
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.780]   I knew that he had been a friend of John Neff
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.940]   and I was gonna ask him about that.
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.700]   For those of you who've been long-term investors
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.780]   in the Vanguard Windsor Fund,
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.500]   you'll of course know John's name.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.700]   I was also gonna ask Charlie about Burt Malkiel.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.300]   Charlie's also good friends with Burt Malkiel.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.420]   They go on vacation together.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.740]   They did a book together,
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.780]   probably the second most famous book that Charlie's written,
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.340]   "The Elements of Investing."
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.900]   And of course, Burt and Charlie sat on the board of directors
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.940]   of Vanguard together for a while,
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.020]   but I'm gonna leave that aside
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.660]   because we're gonna run out of time
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.900]   and I have one last topic that I wanna talk about,
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.220]   one last series of stories, which of course is Jack Bogle.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.620]   So Charlie, you're a management consultant.
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.900]   You look at Jack's tenure
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.700]   as the Chairman Chief Executive of Vanguard.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.540]   How would you appraise him as an executive?
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.940]   - Terrible.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.460]   - Would you like to elaborate?
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:36.460]   - Well, if you had asked as a leader,
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.260]   then I might not have said terrible.
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:44.260]   I would have said compelling, exhilarating,
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:49.260]   inspiring, and capable of causing people
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.540]   to reconsider what they wanted to do with their lives
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.820]   and why they wanted to do it.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:59.140]   You heard earlier observations about the service ethic
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.060]   that's deeply rooted in the people who work at Vanguard.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:07.300]   Candidly, serving as a consultant
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.900]   and then as a director of Vanguard,
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.740]   I was backstage all the time
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:16.740]   and I saw all kinds of opportunities to observe.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.180]   They were a bunch and are today
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.300]   a bunch of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.820]   They are decently nice people to each other,
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.900]   ferocious in their drive to reduce cost.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.620]   Who got that going?
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.180]   That was Jack.
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.420]   He was ferocious at reducing cost.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.060]   And it makes a terrific difference
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.780]   when a large group of people can have a purpose
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.460]   as specific as reducing cost.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:54.220]   And they work away at it all the time, all the time.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.060]   And with great effect.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.300]   Second thing is Jack was determined
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.980]   to have real value delivered.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.700]   And everybody who's at Vanguard has to drink the Kool-Aid.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.980]   If you don't understand,
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.700]   we're here to serve with higher and higher value
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.420]   of the owner, shareholders of Vanguard.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.500]   And the owner part is something they care,
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.620]   they're serious about.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.100]   And they mean it because investors in the Vanguard funds
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:26.100]   are the owners because the funds own Vanguard.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:31.100]   And a little bit of a skittishness on taking risk
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:37.100]   because they, as a group,
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.580]   know that many of us have got this terrible temptation
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.460]   after things have done well to get excited
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.780]   rather than when things look pretty grim but might do well.
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:53.780]   So if you think in terms of leader or founder or inspiration,
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:59.340]   then I think you'd have to rank him exceptionally high.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.020]   The day after Jack died,
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.380]   this is the man that was afraid
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.100]   of people not paying attention.
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.380]   The New York Stock Exchange had 50 photographs
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.980]   of Jack's displayed all over the floor
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.980]   of the New York Stock Exchange
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.140]   because they had such a high regard for what he had done.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.460]   And what he had done was leadership.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.740]   But management, he was terrible.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.900]   He really never, ever understood computers
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.580]   as a cost-saving device.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.900]   He looked at the cost of a computer, the price tag,
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.340]   and said, "That's just too damn much.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.580]   "I'm not gonna pay that."
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.420]   Instead of realizing if he would do that,
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.780]   he would be able to bring the cost levels down.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:49.500]   He really got way behind the curve on computerization
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.660]   and all kinds of technology.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.980]   He made dreadful mistakes.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.260]   He had the chance of a lifetime
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.580]   to seize and make a real success out of ETFs.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.260]   "I'm not gonna do that.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.180]   "ETFs are speculative."
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.620]   "Jack, you don't understand.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.740]   "ETFs are a cheap way for people to own stocks."
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.620]   "No, no, no, they're speculative
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.300]   "'cause you can trade them anytime you want to."
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.420]   "Yes, Jack, most people don't trade them.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.020]   "The hedge funds trade them all over the place.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.340]   "That's where the turnover comes from.
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.140]   "You don't have to worry about individuals.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.980]   "They would buy and sell them when they need to,
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.180]   "but they will not go crazy."
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.360]   "I'm not gonna buy 'em.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.980]   "We're not gonna have anything to do with ETFs.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.420]   "They're speculative."
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.460]   And that lasted for a decade.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.940]   Dead wrong.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:42.580]   His strategy decisions in several cases
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.860]   were also dead wrong.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.100]   He decided, for reasons that were totally inappropriate,
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.300]   that he was gonna do something.
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.660]   And he badgered the board of directors
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.060]   to give him permission to do it.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.100]   And finally, they said, "Jack, for Christ's sake,
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.560]   "it's never gonna amount to anything.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.840]   "And you're all determined.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.080]   "Why don't you go ahead and try it?
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.000]   "And when you fail and come back,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.680]   "we're not gonna hurt your feelings.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.340]   "And we're certainly not gonna penalize you,
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.280]   "but you're really, really wrong.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.800]   "I'm not gonna do it."
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.300]   Okay.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:20.300]   So he went out and organized a new investment service idea.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.200]   And he went to Wall Street and said,
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.240]   "I've got a great idea.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.300]   "You guys are gonna love it.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.860]   "You're really, really gonna love it.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.400]   "I'm gonna raise a very substantial amount of money,
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.860]   "and we're gonna do something
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.500]   "that's innovative and creative,
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.800]   "and you're gonna be able to be a participant in it."
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.020]   Oh, that sounds interesting, Jack.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:38.860]   What is it?
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.980]   Index funds.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.400]   Jack, index funds?
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.460]   There's some experimental work being done
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.280]   at the Wells Fargo Bank with index funds,
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.080]   but that's just not an attractive proposition.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.660]   People wanna beat the market.
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.060]   They don't wanna buy the market.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.060]   They wanna beat the market.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.900]   Besides, you're gonna have a front-end load
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.240]   on this index fund.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.440]   So they're gonna drop back 8% at the very beginning,
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.400]   and the way you're matching it,
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.700]   they'll never, ever catch up
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.220]   because they're gonna stay, at best,
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.300]   at the market rate of return at 8% behind,
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.260]   8% behind, 8% behind.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.420]   Jack, don't you get it?
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.000]   This is a guaranteed failure.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.860]   I'm gonna do it.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:26.860]   And gradually, his aspirations for volume of sales
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:32.600]   went from a substantial $250 million offering
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.080]   to $100 million offering
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.920]   to $50 million offering
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.320]   to $15 million offering,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   and finally, he squeezed it out into the marketplace.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.760]   And it went nowhere, 'cause everybody could see.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.820]   Buy this, you lose on the date of purchase,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.480]   and you will never recover.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:02.400]   And then he thought, you know, if we drop the load,
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.660]   maybe that would help.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.760]   It didn't make any difference.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.800]   By that time, everybody knew not to touch it.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:14.520]   Okay, I'm losing money operating this fund,
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.080]   and the fund itself is losing money,
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.560]   and we've got a front-end load.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   We've gotten rid of the front-end load.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.480]   I need volume.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.180]   So he merged it with a closed-end fund
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:31.560]   that was also being managed, or distributed, by Wellington,
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:35.680]   and that gave him enough to break even.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.920]   And after nearly a decade,
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.760]   indexing started to catch hold.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.600]   It catch hold and went on and on,
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.960]   and I'm all for being ahead of your times,
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.400]   but being that far ahead of your times, I'm not so sure.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.280]   - So we only have a few minutes left.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.600]   If there are any questions, Christine's,
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.480]   oh, Christine already has them?
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.280]   - I have a couple, but I'll take one.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.480]   - All right, we'll try and rattle through these
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.640]   as quickly as possible.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.480]   You need to be a little less loquacious, Charlie.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.680]   - Okay.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.840]   - All right.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.000]   All right, coming back to David Swenson.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.240]   Should investors make room for alternative assets
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.360]   in their portfolio?
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.200]   - No.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.440]   - Would you like to elaborate?
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.640]   - Well, you told me not to.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.720]   Let's be realistic about markets.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.000]   If I were running an alternative investment fund,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.880]   I know where I want to go,
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.840]   where big money makes relatively quick decisions
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.520]   and sticks with them for the long, long time.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.480]   That has nothing to do with individual investors.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.080]   I wouldn't dream of talking to individual investors.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:08.440]   I'd concentrate entirely on endowment funds,
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.920]   and you would never be able to shake me loose from that.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.960]   However, if I were running a,
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:22.480]   I've got to make money somehow enterprise,
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.240]   and I couldn't compete successfully with institutions
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.640]   for institutional money,
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:33.080]   I might very well find a way to create an access
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.800]   for individual investors.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.840]   Nobody's mother would ever say,
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.320]   "Go ahead, go ahead and deal with that guy."
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.240]   And anybody's father would say,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.800]   "Don't touch the son of a bitch."
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.200]   And I think they'd be right.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.000]   It's a fair market out there,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.680]   but that doesn't mean that all the players are fair to you,
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.240]   and if you don't belong there,
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.840]   you're going to be treated unfairly.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.000]   I don't belong there, and I think most individual people
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.240]   don't come near belonging there.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.240]   - All right, second question for you.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.920]   Are there any market segments
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.480]   where investors use actively managed funds?
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:21.800]   - No.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:27.120]   - Not emerging markets?
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   - Well, no, certainly not.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.880]   Let me just be fair.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   If you are fluent in Chinese and are resident in China
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:46.840]   so that you can access a lot of the information
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.360]   that might be available,
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.600]   because the Chinese market is still overwhelmingly dominated
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.280]   by individual investors,
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:01.400]   you could, if you were a logical, hardworking person,
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.040]   gather information that would give you
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.400]   a comparative advantage,
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.160]   and then if you were very disciplined
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.560]   in your investing activities,
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.760]   you could probably do better than the Chinese market.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:21.680]   I have two grandsons who are half Chinese, half American.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.480]   They're fluent in Chinese.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.120]   They might be candidates for this.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.200]   These two kids are really super bright.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.680]   16, and they could do it.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.600]   But if they came to me and said,
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.840]   "Grandpa, that's what we think,"
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.840]   and they call me Charlie,
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.240]   but, "This is what we think we do.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.080]   "We are gonna go to China and make our life there
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.160]   "investing in Chinese stocks,"
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.520]   I would plead with them to do something else
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:55.280]   because they've got quite a lot of talent,
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.360]   and they could do something
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.680]   that's a hell of a lot more interesting
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.400]   than buying and selling stocks.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.360]   - All right, so final question.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.680]   This one is for me.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.800]   What's your favorite Jack Bogle story?
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.720]   You can give us two.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.800]   You have three minutes.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.800]   No pressure.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:27.040]   - Jonathan, you should have given me a pre-warning
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.600]   that that's what you were gonna ask because--
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.440]   - All right, so as a warm-up for Charlie,
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.680]   while the cogs turn, in the early 1990s,
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.920]   I was covering mutual funds at the Journal.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.640]   That was my first job at the Journal,
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   and my counterpart at Barron's was Leslie E.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.560]   And Leslie wrote a piece for Barron's
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.840]   where she referred to Jack
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.320]   as the ever-self-righteous Jack Bogle.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.480]   The day the piece appears, her phone rings,
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.240]   she picks it up, and on the other end
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.600]   is this voice that says,
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.000]   this is the ever-self-righteous Jack Bogle.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.880]   He loved it.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.120]   - That was Jack.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:16.720]   It was an article that had Jack and Warren Buffett
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.760]   analyzed jointly, and Jack was pissed off
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.680]   because Warren was mentioned eight times
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.320]   and he was only mentioned twice.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.880]   - It's one of the great mysteries of all time,
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.640]   which is you go to the campus,
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.200]   you will see a statue of Jack Bogle,
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.480]   a substantial statue, more than life-size.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.400]   And you may be the person who,
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.720]   for the first time in world history,
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.400]   figures out who ordered that damn statue
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.000]   to be put up in that complex.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.160]   I know the directors were not part of that decision.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:00.720]   I know that the management wasn't part of that decision.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.040]   And the only person that I can imagine
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:08.040]   is a certain curmudgeon that wanted not to be forgotten
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.800]   and wanted to be, wanted desperately, desperately
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.680]   to be a hero to ordinary investors.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.480]   And so it came to pass.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:25.040]   Or, as one of Jack's assistants from many years ago,
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.040]   Kevin Laughlin, used to say,
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.640]   there are only two groups of people in the world
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.480]   who walk to the office every day
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.800]   and pass a statue of their boss,
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.400]   the people of North Korea and me.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.120]   Thank you, Charlie, for your time.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.120]   - Thank you, Charlie. - It's been a great conversation.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.180]   you
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:58.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
