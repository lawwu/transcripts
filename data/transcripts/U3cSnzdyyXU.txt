[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.600]   welcome to the huberman lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:14.320]   i'm andrew huberman and i'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at stanford
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.680]   school of medicine my guest today is stuart mcmillan stu mcmillan is one of the world's
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.840]   most sought after coaches for teaching people how to get stronger run faster be more powerful and
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.960]   healthier today we talk about how to do that using what for most people might seem like a rather
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.240]   unconventional set of methods but for any serious track athlete will be very familiar because they
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.400]   do it almost every day and that's skipping and striding you heard right as you'll soon learn
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.440]   skipping what most of us think of as a kid's activity is actually one of the best plyometric
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.760]   activities that we can all do at any age to build more power speed coordination and to improve our
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.840]   muscle fascial and nervous system function stu mcmillan has coached over 70 olympians across
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.000]   nine olympic games and he has coached the players and coaches of every major professional sport he
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.520]   explains how skipping and something called striding are zero-cost activities that we all can and should
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.200]   include in our weekly fitness routine they not only will have you moving better and having better posture
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.240]   in all your activities but they also take minimal time and they can help protect you against injuries and
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.280]   improve your longevity we also talk about the best strides for running at any speed so if you're into
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.400]   jogging or sprinting we talk about all the best ways to do that we talk about the sport of track which
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.840]   both stu and i happen to love and why certain groups of people excel in different sports due to genetic
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.280]   and environmental reasons we also have a very direct and open conversation about the use of performance
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.160]   enhancing tools in the athletic and wellness worlds this is a really special episode because if you like or if you
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.600]   don't like things like running swimming cycling or other activities such as weight training or yoga
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.920]   there's going to be a lot to take away from it that you can apply stew mcmillan is a true savant of
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.080]   coaching how best to move and how to improve your health it was an honor and privilege to host him and to
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.360]   learn from him i'm sure you'll agree before we begin i'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.200]   from my teaching and research roles at stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost of consumer information
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.640]   about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme this episode
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.920]   does include sponsors and now for my discussion with stew mcmillan stew mcmillan welcome thank you great to
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:39.440]   be here we go back a little ways yeah and you're the guy that they call in to make athletes or pretty much anybody
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:48.720]   faster stronger healthier and more powerful and who wouldn't want that athletes uh or otherwise
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.560]   let's start by talking about running you know i think for a lot of people they hear running and
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.200]   they're like oh no running hurts running's painful but i think most people when they think about running
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.400]   they think about jogging they think about running a distance longer than a mile but even for some
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.680]   people running a mile is a painful thought let alone a practice how should we think about running and
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.240]   sprinting in particular because when we grow up we learn to crawl walk run and kids naturally want to run
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:29.200]   fast at some point fast for them what is it about running that for you is such an enchanting thing why do you
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.960]   think that every four years or so depending on when they're scheduling the olympics everyone in this
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.040]   country gets fascinated with who's fastest yeah who's fastest in the world and then they tend to put track
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.000]   and field aside for a bit but people can jump they can swim they can do all these things but running
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.280]   is so fundamental to being human what are your thoughts on running generally and let's break it up into
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.680]   distances why do you love seeing people run fast why have you devoted yourself in part to helping people run
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:07.200]   faster and faster yeah there's a lot in that first running fast for me is the ultimate human activity
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.440]   like the fastest human on the planet is the fastest human on the planet where potentially maybe like
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.640]   the best football player is probably not the best football player the best soccer player is probably not
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.120]   the best soccer player there might be some someone down in argentina who could be a better nfl linebacker
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.640]   than choose your all pro linebacker right now we're sprinting everybody sprints as you said we all run
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   when we're kids and we figure out or our teachers figure out or our coaches figure out well andrew you're
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.720]   a sprinter so you're going to sprint stew you're a middle distance so you go and do that and over the
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.280]   course of time we kind of figure out whether we're good or not and the sprinters like the truly elite
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   sprinters end up being the truly elite sprinters when they are 20 25 30 years old like that's what
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.040]   you do you don't move into something else if you are a super elite sprinter so i think that's part of it
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.400]   is that for me like it is really truly the tip of the spear in human performance the fastest person on the
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.240]   planet is the fastest person on the planet usain bolt is the world record holder and he is the fastest
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.960]   person who's ever ran there's probably not somebody else who you know in the congo somewhere in jamaica
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.200]   that could have been faster than usain because they would have displayed themselves at some point
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.880]   so for me that is it you know and i you know i started coaching kind of 1984 like i've been coaching
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.960]   for a long long time and i started coaching professional in 1992 and i've coached many sports
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:43.200]   many activities many tasks and i i enjoy most of them but for me it is that pinnacle that
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.880]   true tip of the spear that interests me the most and that you only get from sprinting if you're an
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.880]   nfl football player most likely you are playing every game at about 80 of your best
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.000]   if you are 80 of your best and you got onto the 100 meter start line forget about it forget about it
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.600]   if you're less than 99.9 of your best forget about it that's why i truly i love the sprinting events
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.360]   so much and zoomed out from that a little bit like guys i started off as a strength and conditioning coach
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.680]   so it was for me it was more about this the power the strength and the speed it was all of that
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.360]   and i coached bobsled for a long time and i really really enjoyed bobsled because you know these guys are
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.160]   massive they're really strong and they're really fast so that for me was really appealing and that
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.760]   was kind of that that fed my obsession about this peak human performance for a long time
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.400]   until i had the opportunity to actually go and work with like super elite sprinters and now i can't do
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.640]   anything other than that i really can't it's it's fascinating to me how do we compare the fastest
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:07:01.120]   person in the 100 meters versus the 200 versus the 400 so for you is it coaching the 100 that's the most
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.640]   exciting or the 200 or the 400 yeah that's a good question i i actually prefer coaching the 200
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.880]   for a couple of reasons there's a little bit of tactics in the 200 or there's more tactics than there
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.720]   are in the 100 in the 100 the fastest person is going to win in the 200 depending on how you
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.640]   tactically set up your race because it's not an all-out sprint you can't run as fast as you can for 20
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:31.040]   seconds whereas 100 meters you can run as fast as you can for 10 to 11 seconds it is a it's all out
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.120]   right from the start with the 200 you have to kind of either push out really really hard and then smooth
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.840]   it out and then try to finish strong or you start off a little bit easier and you finish strong or you
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.400]   just go out all out and you're just going to fade and see if you can stay ahead so that tactical
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:52.000]   element to for that race for me is really interesting so then you're combining the capacity
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.560]   you know the actual ability to run fast and be super incredibly fast you know high high velocities
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.600]   with the tactical component so it's then you're thinking about okay who's in if my athletes in lane
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.720]   six who's in lane seven who's in lane eight how are we going to determine how we run based upon
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.360]   what the other races are going to do so for me it's a 200. that's not to say i don't love the
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.600]   100. the 100 for me is the one that i if i'm just a fan that's the one that i'm paying attention to the
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.200]   most and every four years people become obsessed with it that that person is generally the winner is
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.880]   characterized as the fastest person on the planet because like you said it's it's all out yeah and at
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:38.080]   the same time i think most people can't really conceive in a concrete way what sprinting 100
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.480]   meters really is about yeah and the world record is held by usain bolt and the record is somewhere
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:50.800]   9.58 seconds and yesterday you told me that means it's about 40 strides to cover 100 meters for usain
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.560]   it was 40 steps correct yeah for uh many other elite sprinters it's somewhere between 40 and 45
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.720]   and the men and somewhere between sort of 47 and 52 for the women i'd like to take a quick break and
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:09.120]   acknowledge our sponsor our place our place makes my favorite pots pans and other cookware surprisingly
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.680]   toxic compounds such as pfaces or forever chemicals are still found in 80 of non-stick pans as well as
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:22.000]   utensils appliances and countless other kitchen products as i've discussed on this podcast these pfaces or
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.960]   forever chemicals like teflon have been linked to major health issues such as hormone disruption
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.480]   gut microbiome disruption fertility issues and many other health concerns so it's really important to
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.160]   avoid them this is why i'm a huge fan of our place our place products are made with the highest quality
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:45.280]   materials and are all pfas and toxin free i particularly love their titanium always pan pro it's the first
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.520]   non-stick pan made with zero chemicals and zero coating instead it's pure titanium this means it has no
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.800]   harmful forever chemicals and that it doesn't degrade or lose its non-stick effect over time
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:02.800]   it's also beautiful to look at i cook eggs in my titanium always pan pro almost every morning the
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.840]   design allows for the eggs to cook perfectly and without sticking to the pan i also cook burgers and
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.480]   steaks in it and it puts a really nice sear on the meat but again nothing sticks to it so it's really
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:18.320]   easy to clean and even dishwasher safe i love it and i use it constantly our place now has a full line of
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.920]   titanium pro cookware that uses this first of its kind titanium non-stick technology so if you're

[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:19.920]   yesterday we were out at the track at malibu high school here teaching my producer rob and i some
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.880]   bounding drills some skipping drills and we'll get back to this because there's such immense value for
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:31.920]   everybody not just people who seek to be competitive runners but for everybody to i realized this morning
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.200]   it's hop skip and jump we were always going to hop skipping a jump away from but to learn how to
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:44.720]   move properly at speed to move properly not at speed i mean there's just so much value in in these drills
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.760]   and what we went through and so we'll get back to that but there was an interesting moment yesterday
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.640]   i recall where some of the kids were getting out of school and started running around the track
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:02.640]   and i had this question in my mind to ask you which was hey can you spot any of those kids as likely to
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.240]   be really excellent sprinters but i didn't even have to ask we watched them go out in a few rows
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.280]   and then you said that kid right there yeah you said that kid right there he's got it
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:22.160]   what was it about the way he was running kid probably was eighth or ninth grade um took one run away from
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:29.360]   us and you said that that kid's a sprinter yeah what was it was it his speed was it the the form what was
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.400]   it was first of all it was not the form because most of those kids are you know limbs are going
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.720]   all over the place right it's how they interact with the ground and it's it's this qualitative
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:47.600]   component that is really hard to define it's if you if you watch a elite boxer hit a heavy bag there's
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.920]   a pop sound to it pop pop pop pop and it's the same with elite sprinters or not even elite sprinters but
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:01.040]   anybody who's fast and effective and efficient at applying force against an object and you see that
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:07.120]   as young as as we saw yesterday with what 12 13 14 year olds right some of them are just thudding on the
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:14.720]   ground and just pushing back and kind of like rob you're your producer um but which by the way folks we're
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.320]   taking a couple of jobs at rob he's he's in the room with us now although off camera rob has run multiple
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.680]   triathlons he's an incredibly impressive athlete and um as an incredibly impressive athlete we can
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.800]   we can jab at him every now and again but this one kid he was just re it was far more efficient on the
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:36.480]   ground than everyone else it was just pop pop pop pop pop pop pop and you could hear it and i hear it
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.120]   generally i hear it before i see it and that's i think it's actually what i heard first and i looked
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.320]   around and said oh that's that's the kid like he's a sprinter and then you just kind of look at had at his
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.080]   form and it just looks better there's just a quality to that that you don't see with these
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.440]   other kids and even though limbs are going all over the place and head is going from side to side and
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.680]   you know it's his feet are going all over the place and hands are flapping you know like wings
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:09.360]   there's just a fluidity even with him looking like that he just is doing it much more coordinated and
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:15.120]   fluid than everyone else who looked like they were trying hard and with him it didn't look like he was
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:21.840]   trying hard and typically i mean that is by the way the differentiator between all elite and sub-elite
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.480]   athletes regardless of the sport the best athletes are always the ones that make it look the easiest
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:33.760]   and that kid just made it look easier than everyone else could you send a kid like that out for a 400
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:42.000]   meter run and then meet him at the line and say you know what you're meant to run the 200 or you're meant to run
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.760]   the 100 is it possible to tell whether or not somebody is meant for a particular distance based
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.200]   on how they do in a slightly different distance yeah i don't i don't especially not at that age you know
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.320]   at that age you want him to be doing or her to be doing as many different events as possible and let's
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.520]   just trial them all i don't think they should even at that age at 12 13 14 say you're a sprinter
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.600]   you're a sprinter and you're a jumper and maybe we'll do some middle distance and we'll do some
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.960]   relays and then we can do a couple throws as well and see which one that you kind of enjoying the most
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.720]   number one and then number two what are you actually showing some expertise towards and hopefully those
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:25.120]   two things match and then you can start looking at specializing for the kind of event group a little
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.480]   bit later and you know even and that comes a lot later than many you know people outside of track
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:37.040]   and field think um even with you know most ncaa division one college programs are pretty elite i
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:42.320]   mean that's some high performing athletes and many of those sprinters do the one the two the four all the
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.520]   relays and often your best sprinters are also your best jumpers so you might have a you might have
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:53.120]   your 100 meter specialist also do the long jump and the triple jump and it won't be until maybe the
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.680]   second or the third or fourth year of college or maybe even the first year as a pro where they start
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.800]   actually doing just the one or two events i ran cross country as a senior in high school i've been
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.000]   running consistently since i was 16 three times a week i don't consider myself even a runner i just run
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.440]   for the pleasure of it a long run a medium run and a short run um but perhaps it was the movies about
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.080]   steve prefontaine of which there were two i think one's called uh prefontaine and the other one's
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:25.600]   called without limits that are quite good that got me excited about track and then i started going up
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.360]   to university of oregon and attending track meets as a fan yeah um but there's this dramatized moment
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:41.040]   about pre as they called him uh and bowerman the coach up at in eugene where allegedly um purportedly uh
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.160]   pre wants to run the mile because everyone in the country at that time was obsessed with who's the
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:52.240]   fastest miler but bowerman says to him no you're a 5 000 runner you're gonna run the three mile and he
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.480]   said no one cares about the 5 000 he said you're gonna make them care and it turned out to be the
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:02.480]   right fit the 5 000 was the right event for him so that was a moment where a coach could identify
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:09.680]   you could be a great miler but you'll be a spectacular 5 000 runner is that based on sort
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:17.520]   of times and splits and recovery and all that or is there actually a body type and a gate that um is
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.640]   best because one of my favorite things to find on social media i promise this is not a digression is
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:29.360]   where they'll set out a race an animated race between like a rabbit a cheetah an elephant a human it's very
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.680]   interesting to see which animals are fastest over which distances they fall out over different
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.280]   distances and most people perhaps are surprised to find that the animal that wins the long long
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:45.680]   long longest distance and beats all the other species is us yeah the human right so we're not
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:52.560]   good in the in the sprint compared to the cheetah but we are oh so good at the marathon and ultra marathon
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.800]   compared to the cheetah or any other animal so do you think it's something special about the gate
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:06.720]   um the personality times in various events i mean what what funnels um somebody's understanding of
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.560]   themselves uh or an athlete to say you know you're meant to you're meant to do this yeah i think you
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.200]   nailed it at the end their understanding of themselves i think is a really important part of it
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.320]   you know we find ourselves through movement and we fall in love with whatever it is because that's
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:27.120]   what we do and we tend to do it really well so i coached a british sprinter for a long time her name
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.440]   is jody williams i coached her for about a decade starting in 2015 she just retired at the end of last
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:40.400]   season she went when she was young so between i think the ages of 13 and 17 she won 150 straight
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:47.360]   races in the 100 and the 200 never lost was the best at every single age group all over the world
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:57.200]   for five years finally lost and did not really transition into being an elite 100 meter 200 meter
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:03.520]   sprinter but this was her identity she'd always been the fastest person so when i started coaching her in
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:13.440]   2015-16 when she was 22 that was what she did she was 100 200 meter girl but she wasn't elite she wasn't
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:20.160]   world class and we kept on pushing her towards the 100 and 200 because this was what she saw herself as
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.760]   and me external to that what i saw her as as well and everyone else expected from her because she was
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.800]   the best in the world for so long and it's a funny thing happened sort of five years into that we did
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:39.600]   a a relay a four by four early season at arizona state university and she ran really fast in this
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.880]   four by four relay and she enjoyed it and she didn't enjoy getting beat in the 100 and the 200 anymore
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:53.760]   and she said hmm maybe i can do the 400 and then the 2019 world championships in doha she made the british
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:00.720]   team in the 200 didn't do very well but ran the relay ran the four by four and ran the fastest split
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:08.800]   of all the countries she ran 49-4 on a four by four split and said okay we're 400 meter runner now so
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:15.040]   sometimes it's just that sometimes it takes a long time for the athlete to come to the realization that
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.000]   this is what they connect with like this is this is who i am you know what you know what i mean like
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.560]   it's it's really it's not as easy as just saying oh we've got a bunch of tests and you're 100 meter
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:31.520]   you're 200 you're a 400 for her it took her over a decade to come to terms of the fact that you know
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:38.080]   i can't do the 100 200 anymore but i could be really good at the 400 and then and two years later at the
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:44.800]   2020 olympic games which ended up being obviously in 21 uh she was sixth in the 400 meters in the olympics
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:53.280]   49.9 twice so it's uh you know it's um in hindsight we wonder if we moved into the 400 five years
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.560]   earlier three or four years earlier maybe she could have had a medal but yeah it's it's an interesting
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:04.480]   one like it's we're always using all the different pieces of information that we have at hand some of
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.200]   it's quantitative sometimes some of some of it's qualitative some of it is just a feeling and with
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.000]   with jody specifically it was you know what did i better connect with because you know that's
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.080]   typically that's as i said that's why we get into sport in the first place if we can't connect with
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:24.720]   that as an individual with why we're doing it then why are we even doing it i feel like this is a great
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   metaphor for life in general for career i mean i've enjoyed different careers and um i'm glad i started in
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.600]   the one i did but that i've ended up in the one i'm in now even though i still teach and i'm involved
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:45.840]   in research in some ways that um there's such an immense pleasure to finding the the thing yeah for
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:51.120]   oneself yeah but you can't get there first this is what i think is frustrating to young people now because
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.280]   of the internet they think like what's my calling what's what's my event what's my sport what am i built
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:01.600]   for and then you have all these examples right you've got your um shaquille o'neal's clearly built
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.800]   for basketball and then you have your growing up when i grew up your spud web yeah right much much
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.600]   shorter than most of the professional players in the nba but wins the slam dunk competition and so he's
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   always used as an example that you can bridge these these gaps but i do think that dedicated application
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:27.680]   to one area is the best lane from which to exit to another freeway yeah you can't just get on to the
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:32.960]   the uh the audubon so to speak for you you have to sometimes get on you know highway 101 for a while
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.600]   and speed a little bit or or crash you know i'm not being literal here um you said something i think
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.800]   is immensely powerful i'd like to use as a segue which is that we find ourselves through movement
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.440]   i think this is so true um and not just for people who are trying to figure out what athletic or
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:57.120]   exercise endeavors are best for them but certainly there i'd like to contrast jogging and running
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:06.720]   yesterday you you mentioned a few things that to me just feel like gems because like i said i'll try and
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:13.680]   run far-ish for me i go by time about an hour once a week 30 minutes on another day and a what's to say
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.480]   about a 15 minute not all out but close to all out on a separate day i've tried ad nauseam to
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.440]   figure out whether or not it's best to heel strike and roll whether or not it's best to land on the toe
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:32.560]   whether it's us to lift the knee i mean for the the uninformed um who goes to the internet you can get
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:39.520]   answers about this all sorts of ways let's start with the slowest movement possible which is just walking
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.960]   let's forget about speed walking for sake of this conversation for a number of reasons race walking
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:51.280]   race walking excuse me race walking um see i even forgot the name of it no disrespect to race walkers
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:57.760]   no disrespect to race walkers but most people don't seek to race walk i think um but let's talk about
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:05.280]   walking yeah when we walk do we we heel to toe roll naturally do we middle of foot to toe roll and then let's
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:14.240]   proceed to jogging running and then let's step up through the various gear systems yeah yeah um there's
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:22.240]   probably five separate gait patterns walking is the first one and typically most people will strike on
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.040]   their heel they'll roll over and they'll toe off on their toe and we do that up to about
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:34.800]   two to 2.2 to 2.3 meters a second until we can no longer do that so we start walking we walk really
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:42.160]   really slow and if we start increasing our speed you'll find that you'll almost self-organize into
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.840]   the speed that feels really nice for you if you were going going for a walk you would self-organize towards
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:53.840]   your most efficient or your most stable velocity for that walk and if you don't not thinking about it you
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:00.480]   will self-organize towards your most efficient mechanical solution as well that it might be flat
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.360]   foot it might be right up high on your heel with massive amount of dorsiflexion it might be a little
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:13.120]   bit lower on the heel but that's all contingent upon your individual structure how your foot is
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:19.680]   built how it coordinates with your knee and your hip if you're not thinking about it we typically will
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:27.040]   self-organize towards what is most efficient most stable for us and then as we get faster and faster
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:33.280]   and faster you'll feel that that stability and that inefficiency starts to rock a little bit and you can
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:39.600]   no longer walk and what do we do then to get and to get faster we actually have to transition to a totally
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:48.000]   different gait pattern we start to jog because we're with just so much instability inefficiency that that
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.720]   pattern just start begins to break down and we start to jog let me back up just a little bit so if you
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:02.000]   were to walk with let's say your your 80 year old neighbor and you're doing a walk with her that's
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.240]   probably going to be pretty taxing for you pretty uneconomical pretty inefficient because you have to
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.720]   shuffle a little bit you're walking so slow you're probably gonna be bent over a little bit but if the
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:18.400]   neighbor went in you just continue to walk you would speed up to your most efficient pattern so within
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:24.320]   all of these gait patterns there is almost like an upside down you where you start off really inefficient
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.560]   unstable as you get faster and faster and faster efficiency increases stability increases and you
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.760]   keep getting faster and faster and faster stability goes down again efficiency goes down again before you
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:43.200]   have to transition to a different pattern so jogging occurs at somewhere around 20 percent of your maximum
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:51.600]   sprint speed so you know whether that's 1.8 to 2 to 2.2 meters per second and then we start to jog and
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.120]   eventually we can't jog at that speed anymore so we have to transition to a different gait pattern and we
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:03.920]   start to run and that's kind of what we were doing yesterday in fact you know we spent some time running now it's
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:09.520]   important you asked me about kind of heel strike and and where we are within the foot we're thinking
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:15.760]   about the same thing throughout and that's just to move from here to there as efficiently as we can
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.120]   understanding that we will typically as a sales as i said self-organize towards our most efficient
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.400]   pattern and the only time we actually think about doing something different than that is when somebody
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   outside tells us to do something different and messes up the efficiency most of the time so for me it's
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:38.480]   uh like the big cueing and we talked about this yesterday right we said flat foot contact and if
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.840]   you think about being flat foot contact and all of the different things that you do all the different
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:50.000]   gait patterns you do the velocity is what determines where in the foot you actually will contact so if
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.800]   you're walking and you're thinking flat foot you'll actually go heel strike you'll roll over and your toe
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:00.320]   off and if you're sprinting as fast as you can you're thinking flat foot contact you will actually plantar
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.000]   flex slightly just prior to ground contact and you'll contact the ground more towards your toes than you
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.120]   will if you're just walking or running or jogging we should clarify for people dorsiflexion is when
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.400]   your toes come close up towards your shin correct uh you're you're narrowing that angle between your your
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:22.960]   foot and your you know front lower part of your lower limb and um plantar flexion is the opposite yes
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.560]   pointing the toe i think uh attempting to go ballerina and point but hopefully unless you're
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.400]   a ballerina you're not getting all the way you know to get to your initial point as well it's like
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.840]   how many of us were taught to sprint up high on our toes when we were kids like we all were right yeah
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:46.400]   up on your toes keep your not keep your arms at 90 degrees and get really really tall and that's totally
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:51.520]   opposite to what we should be doing yeah sometimes kids when they run when they're real little you
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.040]   know like three or four like when they're just running around the house barefoot they'll like run on their
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:02.240]   toes um so what you're basically saying if i understand correctly is the speed should dictate
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:07.520]   the foot strike correct okay i think that's a very important point for people um who are interested in
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:14.720]   running or already running the speed should dictate the foot strike yeah that unless there's a problem
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:21.120]   to resolve yes that a coach has told you you need to resolve and how to do it you shouldn't be thinking
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.280]   about heel striking or toe striking you should be thinking about the speed that you're trying to cover
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:30.960]   the distance and yeah and if you're thinking about anything just think about being flat just think
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:36.320]   about being flat and the foot will take care of itself due to the velocity let's talk a little bit more
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:42.880]   about body position and running mechanics um there may be no hard and fast rules to this but
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:48.160]   where should my eyes be you know i've heard oh you want to be looking but assuming i'm not in a race
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:54.640]   against anyone i'm you know heading out for a run doesn't matter which duration um does it matter where
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:03.200]   i place my my vision um in sprinting a hundred percent i feel like the longer the the distance is the
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.320]   less it probably matters because the velocity is so much slower i feel like when you're if you're going
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   out for a jog and it's 10 minute miles you're probably looking pretty much straight ahead of you
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.520]   you know and if it's a little bit darker and maybe you're on a rocky surface or something or a little
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:24.480]   bit uneven surface you're looking down a little bit but it doesn't seem to really have a systemic effect on
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:30.240]   how you move but it does when you sprint because obviously your body is going to follow your eyes
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.440]   so if you're running down the track and you're sprinting as fast you can and your eyes creep up
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.880]   and you start looking up then the chin is going to follow that and you just start this extension
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:46.640]   pattern in the entirety of the system as soon as you lift your chin up you get into more extension through
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.600]   the rib cage and the spine and then the lumbar and everything gets extended you end up standing
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.440]   up so more arched back a little bit more right posture correct for those aren't familiar with
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.480]   flexion and extension um unless we say otherwise if we talk about flexion we're talking about assuming the
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.320]   dreaded c-shaped position that everyone seems so good at these days collapsed it toward their uh midline
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:13.520]   uh versus extension where your chin is up and away from the chest and your um right upright posture and if
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:18.320]   the eyes come up first you're going to end up in what's known as a hyper extended position it's too
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.120]   much extension where really what we want the eyes to do is just come with the rest of the torso
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:29.600]   so how i the cue that i use for the sprinters is allow your torso to determine when the chin and when
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.640]   the eyes come up not the opposite way around because if the eyes come first the chin follows and then we
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:41.040]   get this disconnect between the head and the thorax and the pelvis and there's just too much extension we end
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:46.480]   up kind of just pushing our way down the track rather than bouncing yeah there's a wonderful movement
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:52.560]   in yoga that's helped me a lot in my weight lifting uh over the years i did a little bit of yoga when i
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.200]   lived in san diego um because they had good yoga classes where you they have you do this kind of
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.560]   ragdoll hanging over at the waist position looks like a jefferson deadlift for the for the gym rats or
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   the olympic lifters rounded lower back and then they have you stand up from that position but
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:18.240]   you deliberately start at your lower spine and and rap unpeel yourself from that folded over position
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   never letting the head lead but you know so basically like a chain coming up from the spine
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:29.200]   and then that the head come moves last i mean it's moving the whole time but it uh you're looking
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.720]   straightforward last as opposed to what you're saying where you lift the head first that's been
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:38.640]   tremendously helpful to me in movements in the gym which i think have helped me a lot like glute ham raises
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.840]   where you you know you're essentially in that position and you come all the way up and then you
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:48.080]   go into a hamstring curl or a deadlift or any kind of movement where you have where i'm going from
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:57.200]   torso bent forward to up i remembered it move the torso first and the head last and i'll just say
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.160]   in my own experience the strength increases that come from doing it that way as opposed to moving the
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:08.000]   head first and trying to then pull the weight up it's remarkable yeah you're we are all so much
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.800]   stronger than we think if we um engage the motor neurons in the proper sequence yeah so i think
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   that's what you're referring to here 100 okay do you um here's a question for you when you were first
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:24.640]   uh taught how to squat were you told to look at the ceiling or up on the wall yeah i was told um the
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:30.880]   weight will go where my eyes go right but now i now i where did that come from i still don't understand
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.480]   where that came from i don't know i mean some of the most useful things that have been told to me over
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.640]   the years that made a tremendous difference would be like this um again borrowed from yoga i sort of
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:44.240]   brought it into the gym then when i talked to proper you know uh people like proper biomechanics folks
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.640]   like yourself or kelly starrett they go yeah of course you have to move your spine and torso before
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:54.720]   um but one of the most useful things for the squat and for the deadlift um has been
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.760]   because it's very difficult to think about many things at once especially when you're on
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:07.360]   you're pulling or trying to squat heavy loads is to move uh my chest and my hips at the same time
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:13.600]   together so that you don't end up doing the the dreaded um uh good morning back raise followed by
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:18.480]   standing up right um so moving them in unison so thinking about my chest and my hips moving at the
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:24.160]   same time that's been tremendously helpful and tends to put the head in the right position and
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:30.080]   the other one is oh right when dead lifting to not think about pulling the weight off the floor but
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:35.040]   rather pushing my feet into the ground while driving back you know and these little things end up making
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:41.760]   a huge difference not just in terms of the amount of weight that you can pull or squat but the safety
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:47.680]   of the movement is just so much more stable to drive the feet into the ground yeah you think why did why was i
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.040]   trying to pull a weight off the ground all i had to do was like push my feet hard into the ground and
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:57.680]   hold on to this bar and boom you're up that easy it's wild how um we pick up bad habits it's also
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:03.920]   wild how quickly those bad habits can be resolved so in keeping with that back to running i believe that
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:09.520]   everyone can and should run most everyone there's certain people who can't run for uh you know various
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:16.160]   reasons but um but that people who can walk very likely can run and i'm becoming more of a believer
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:24.000]   with every moment i spend with you that uh sprinting is more valuable than jogging
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:31.200]   that sprinting is more valuable than any kind of distance run and i'm going to offend a lot of people but
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:40.960]   i love long distance running so i'm offending myself um yesterday we didn't sprint but we did a lot of
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:47.440]   skipping let's talk about skipping and yes i'm talking about skip skip skip this okay this thing i'm not
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:56.320]   gonna sing the rest of that skipping is such a natural movement for people most people and it
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:03.040]   feels so damn good and it's actually a bit more taxing than people believe and i came out of that
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:09.440]   workout skipping yesterday from skipping yesterday feeling like my hips were nice and open tons of
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:16.800]   extension my posture's up i feel like i grew an inch i i was strong in the gym this morning i just feel
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:22.240]   incredible what is it about skipping and why do you have sprinters skip so much and why is it why aren't
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.360]   more people talking about skipping and yes we will return to to gate stuff but i think we have to talk
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:35.760]   about skipping yeah uh yeah first of all we skipped a lot because the reality is you could not sprint
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:43.600]   and that is the reality for almost everybody because we stop sprinting when we're whatever
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:49.120]   age some people stop sprinting at 15 sometimes some people it's 20 but very few people are actually
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:55.840]   sprinting through their 20s and next to nobody is sprinting through their 30s so we know that the
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:01.600]   movement of sprinting or running fast and we kind of know what what this does and why this is good for
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:08.480]   you right we know that yeah moving our body intensively with intensity is probably something
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:16.400]   we should be able to do for as long as we possibly can but we can't because typically we've still got
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:23.760]   pretty good engines into our 30s and 40s and 50s but we don't have the bodies to be able to handle the
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:30.640]   stresses and the forces that this engine could put into the body so our tissue and our joints just
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:36.000]   is not able to handle all of these forces if you were to go out and sprint yesterday even if we did
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.680]   you know we ended up warming up for how long an hour and a half warm-up if we did a let's say a real
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.320]   proper warm-up we warmed up for 30 minutes and then i just said andrew i want you to sprint as fast as you
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:51.280]   possibly can for 50 meters that's not going to end well for most people maybe you could get through
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.320]   it yesterday but for most people that wouldn't end well you end up with a pull or a strain or a couple
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.800]   days of just feeling not well because we just don't do that we don't have the tissue capacity to be able
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.680]   to handle that anymore or the joint capacity you know there's so many people assuming they they have
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.520]   to run really quickly somewhere and they just didn't know that they had to do it or they're playing
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:15.120]   backyard basketball or football and they tweak a hamstring or tweak a calf or something even worse
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.160]   right it happens all the time we just do not have the tissue capacity anymore to handle those forces
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:28.000]   so what do we do instead and i i typically recommend two activities one is running up hills
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.160]   there's a lot less stress on the tissue and the joint system by sprinting up a hill than there is on
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:39.440]   sprinting on a straightaway but second i think more important is actually skipping and i and i
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:46.160]   i'm i'm with you i don't know why we stopped skipping i think it's associated with uh only childlike
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.160]   behavior but that's like saying jump rope is only associated with childlike behavior and i'm a big
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:56.560]   believer in skipping rope we'll talk about skipping rope but i think that's it um yeah i mean maybe
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:02.000]   this conversation or this portion of the conversation could be titled you know um let's normalize skipping
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:09.280]   yeah for adults absolutely it felt awesome yeah you can cover a lot of ground quickly heart rate gets
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:15.200]   up but not to an outrageous degree you're not sucking for air but it does feel a little silly
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.800]   if you're not on a track but you've mentioned uh you've what's the longest distance you've ever
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:26.400]   skipped 10 miles did you get some funny looks i got a few nice and you're a real tall guy you're
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:32.960]   6'3 so you can't really uh hide no uh very easily that was in the park so there wasn't a lot of people
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:39.600]   okay but i skipped for uh 20 minutes every morning on the roads i get a few honks that's okay i mean
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   they could be honks of approval it could well be yeah or something else but you think about it like
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:49.520]   it's you you're actually taxing the coordination patterns and the tissue and the joints in pretty
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:56.640]   similar ways as if we were going to sprint we're working on pushing the knee behind the hip getting into
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:03.040]   this knee behind butt pattern this hip extension pattern which is so important and and i know this
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.760]   is a a topic of conversation that you had with kelly when kelly was on here the importance of getting
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:13.440]   your knee behind your butt and finding and searching for opportunities to do that more often because we
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:20.640]   lose that so easily so skipping allows us to do that secondary to that is the coordination aspect
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:26.960]   between how we coordinate the flexion extension at the ankle the flexion extension at the knee and the
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:32.880]   flexion extension at the hip and we do that in a very similar way as sprinting where each of them
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:41.040]   stiffen at this at this time that is um uh considered throughout the entirety of the system
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.240]   where it's just like the spring the leg acts as a spring where if you think about when we jog or when
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.880]   we run we're kind of running on our ankles and knees a little bit we don't feel like we're really using
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:56.560]   our hips when you're running a 10 minute mile it's all it's a lot of stress through the foot it's a lot
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:02.000]   of stress through the calves and by the way i'm not anti-running or anti-jogging i jog and i run and i still
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.320]   do all that stuff i'm not saying now stop doing all that and just go and skip i'm just saying find some
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:15.600]   opportunities to also skip because skipping where ashley can tax the system in very similar ways as
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:22.640]   pretty high intensity sprinting i'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor ag1 ag1 is an
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:29.120]   all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink with adaptogens i've been taking ag1 daily since 2012

[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:42.560]   mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs now i've spoken many times before
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.280]   on this and other podcasts about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.080]   health physical health and performance when we aren't sleeping well or enough on a consistent basis
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.800]   everything suffers and when we are sleeping well and enough our mental health physical health and
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:02.080]   performance in all endeavors improves markedly now the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:07.360]   in the quality of sleep that you get each night how soft it is or how firm it is how breathable it is
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:12.320]   all play into your comfort and need to be tailored to your unique sleep needs if you go to the helix
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.880]   website you can take a brief two-minute quiz which will ask you questions such as do you sleep on your
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.440]   back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night things of that sort
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.920]   now maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way helix will match you to
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:31.040]   the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress i started sleeping on the dusk
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.840]   mattress about three and a half years ago and it's been far and away the best sleep that i've ever had
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:41.040]   so much so that when i travel and i'm not on my dusk mattress i really miss it when i get home i just find
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:46.640]   that i sleep so much better because of that mattress if you'd like to try helix you can go to helix
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:51.680]   sleep.com huberman take that two-minute sleep quiz and helix will match you to a mattress that's
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:57.600]   customized for you right now helix is giving up to 20 off on all mattress orders again that's helix
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:04.480]   sleep.com huberman to get up to 20 off i want to hover a little bit on knee behind butt
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.280]   so shout out kelly starrett shout out kelly starrett i mean if you think about this
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:18.160]   folks like knee behind butt means into extension so the hips are opening so to speak i know in yoga
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:24.480]   they say hip opening means a different thing but hip extension generally means posture is more elevated
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.280]   chin away from chest generally i mean you could get knee behind butt with your chin down but it's tougher
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:36.800]   just that the sternum comes up um kind of naturally puts us into external rotation so think uh thumbs
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:43.280]   out to the side like the fawns as opposed to inward and then you think about the the typical sitting
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:52.320]   standing walking jogging pattern of everybody yeah especially if you're a commuter um doesn't matter
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:46:00.400]   if you're on a subway bus um car or otherwise or plane you're you're folded in and so what i'm
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:09.360]   starting to realize is that knee uh knee behind butt ankle elevated sternum up i mean these are the
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:16.560]   hallmarks of locomotion yeah and so it's interesting that walking well jogging in particular seems to
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:22.240]   follow this kind of like forward folded kind of like almost like falling forward kind of thing i'm not
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:28.560]   trying to beat up on jogging because i also like to jog but i wonder if minute for minute
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:36.080]   skipping would be a much better activity than jogging for people who want to elevate their
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.560]   heart rate you know all the standard general adaptations that occur with exercise improved
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:46.640]   insulin regulation etc etc um do you think for the person who has not skipped in a while to go out and
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:52.160]   skip for a couple minutes is the way to do it or should they skip for a lap and then walk a lap
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:56.400]   what would be the way to break into this yeah i think i think probably the the worst thing to do
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:02.960]   is go out for a 10 mile skip don't do that i think we start off with like a 30 second skip 30
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:08.880]   second jog 30 second skip 30 second jog or 30 second skip followed by a 30 second walk and the
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.440]   difference is you'll feel this right if you think about when you skip and we talked about this a lot
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:20.240]   yesterday i was asking you to be expressive express yourself think about what your posture is and how
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:25.600]   you're holding yourself you don't really feel you don't seem to think about those things when you jog
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.000]   you just jog and as you said you're kind of closed and small and short and you're just trying to get
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.280]   through it right the heart rate gets up to whatever it is and yeah you get some good exercise but skipping
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:41.360]   here's your opportunity to truly express yourself be big and free and open and bouncy and rhythmical
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:47.680]   all of these things that were at one point in our lives pretty important to us and we lose and that's
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:53.280]   what's that is what we get from sprinting right the best sprinters are the ones who can express themselves
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:48:01.760]   truly maximally like totally let go and it doesn't have to be like massively powerful like the skips
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.600]   that we were doing yesterday were what we call low amplitude skips where we're just sort of skipping
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:11.680]   back and forth but you're still asking you to be tall and expressive and swing and be stiff on the ground
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:17.520]   and i feel like like there's as i said there's so many different benefits to this whether it's just
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:23.600]   been the plyometric benefit whether it's the fascial benefit whether it be it because this is such
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:30.160]   a a cross body coordinative aspect there's all sorts of brain benefits to that as you know
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:36.080]   it's uh i mean it's just it's just there's so much more benefits to skipping than there is to just
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:41.760]   jogging so the on-ramp for me when i talk to people about the benefits of skipping is just to put it in
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.640]   their jogs so i was talking to one of your photographers yesterday and said how do i do this
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:53.360]   i usually jog and i'm going like 10 minute mile pace i said well next time you jog just in
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:58.000]   you know go for your jogs you know go for about a mile or so when you're doing a typical jog and
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   then just go back and forth between skipping and jogging every 30 seconds or so and i guarantee you
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.360]   that you will feel better with every skip that you do every single one because there's this again the
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:15.600]   self-organizing coordinative aspect to it where you start feeling a little bit more bouncy a little lighter
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:21.360]   a little bit more coordinated a little bit more rhythmic which feeds your jogging so for me that's
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:27.200]   probably the best on-ramp is just to work it into your current jogs and then from there start getting
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.920]   a little bit more powerful with it a little bit more expressive with it now we start driving the thigh
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:37.360]   up and back and get again a little a little bit more hip extension so being you know now we can start
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:44.320]   talking about skips for distance where you're trying to say okay from here that tree that's 50 meters away
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:50.160]   how many steps do i need to take to get to that 50 meter away tree so doing things like that yeah i'm
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:57.200]   fascinated by activities both physical and mental that facilitate the transition into a more difficult
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:06.240]   activity physical physical or mental i started to think about this when i started working on my book
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:14.240]   in earnest it's very hard to just jump into writing but i noticed that if i did some drawing listen to a
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:22.480]   lecture while i was drawing and i do anatomical drawings very easy to transition into writing i enjoy drawing i'm not
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:27.680]   trying to accomplish much with it but it's a very natural activity for me and just very easy to drop
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:34.560]   into a deep groove for writing for hours really and then i started talking to a musician friend of mine
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:39.360]   who he's a songwriter very accomplished songwriter and he does the same and then i saw a post from
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:44.320]   joanie mitchell that she would paint before she would sing and i think these transition activities that
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:50.640]   are natural for us that don't feel as constricted by distance over time or you know sometimes i put my
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:55.680]   drawings on social media but they're really for me their way of kind of thinking about the biology from
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:02.560]   a circuit standpoint it is very personal and kind of abstract as you talk about skipping it seems a little
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:08.400]   bit the same where you know skipping we're not necessarily trying to become the fastest skipper in the world
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:15.040]   or beat our yesterday's skipping time we're just trying to skip with more as you said more expression
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:21.920]   more enjoyment yeah but perhaps it sounds like indeed it can help transition into a faster gate with what
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:27.120]   we're doing for jogging or for running or transition us right into into sprinting
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:33.600]   and i think that these um transition points for physical and mental activities are very important
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:40.000]   because these days there's so many tools and protocols you know dare i say and people start
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.320]   to feel like oh i have to do all of these things how would i do this right how am i supposed to meditate
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:48.400]   and get sunlight and do it you know i already exercising a ton now i mean now you want me to skip
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:54.720]   the way you describe it is completely different it's saying no you're still doing your cardio quote
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:59.600]   unquote but maybe you do your zone two cardio and you incorporate some skipping which will make your zone two
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:06.400]   faster for you yeah or your your your high intensity interval training more um you'll feel more pliable
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:12.640]   more explosive mike that yeah i think that's that's part of it i think step one is incorporating in so
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:18.160]   you can actually be comfortable skipping and step two is now can we add a little bit more speed force
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:24.160]   velocity to that skip where it becomes in and of itself a workout where you're skipping as hard as you can
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:29.360]   for 50 meters and walking back and doing that 10 to 15 times is that would you consider that a solid
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:34.080]   workout for skipping that would be a great skipping workout skipping 50 meters yeah walking back yeah
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:41.520]   doing that 10 to 15 times yeah because that's that is safe if you warm up i'm not saying go out and do
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:47.120]   a maximal effort skip for 50 meters without doing a warm-up do a good warm-up first that includes some
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:52.640]   low amplitude skips and maybe some jogs and some stretches do that for 10 or 15 minutes and then do some
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:59.840]   maximal amplitude skips for over 50 meters that's a great workout in and of itself like a lot a lot of
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:06.720]   really beneficial plyometric work being done there let's talk about concentric and eccentric aspects of
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:13.040]   running and skipping so folks concentric generally associated with the lifting phase although sometimes
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:18.080]   it's just the pulling phase if it's a pull up and then eccentric would be the lowering phase of some
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:22.560]   movement um in running where's the concentric where's the eccentric for the uninformed if you could just
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:30.400]   tell us uh well in running concentric is pretty important because most of running is pretty concentric
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:35.040]   dominant you're on the ground for quite a long time and you push behind your center mass for quite a long
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:41.760]   time in striding and sprinting which are the two faster gates so you've got walking jogging running
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:48.640]   striding and sprinting striding and sprinting which is upwards of so striding if you think about being
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:55.280]   75 to 90 percent or 80 percent to 95 percent of your maximum sprint speed that's called stride that's called
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:01.360]   striding and then sprinting is anything above that where you actually it's purely truly maximal as we said
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:09.120]   these are different uh gait patterns entirely um those sprinting and striding is almost entirely
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:15.760]   eccentric entirely you're breaking it's all breaking it's all breaking forces is how well do you handle
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:22.720]   those breaking forces if you do not handle those breaking forces well you're not fast it's and and
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:30.000]   concentric any concentric force ability or concentric force capacity is just not a differentiator at elite
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.160]   elite speed in fact it seems to be reverse so we we did a lot of testing through the 90s when i was
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:41.600]   up in calgary i was working for the canadian sports center in calgary uh starting in 1994 or so and was
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:48.160]   there for a long time and we were we had you know because 27 different national teams are based there
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:55.760]   and all of the university of calgary uh sports teams were also there we could test out the yin yang for
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:01.840]   hundreds of athletes every single day and one of the things that we tested was was concentric isometric
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:07.600]   and eccentric force capacities and which ones actually related to being actually good at your sport
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:14.480]   and almost every single sport the concentric force capacity and you pick the one whether it's peak
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:20.720]   whether it's rate of force application whether it's time time to peak concentric force capacity just did not
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:26.320]   at all differentiate between the elite performers in that sport and the sub elite performers in that
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:34.720]   sport but eccentric did all across the board i'm absolutely struck by this stride comes before sprint
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:39.840]   thing and and i'm remembering back to to uh to cross country where they say we're going to do a stride
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:46.800]   workout at the end of a run we get back to the the track at school and they do some strides and um i'm just
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:52.160]   chuckling to myself because i always would tell myself in subsequent years you know okay i'm going to
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:59.760]   sprint but i'm going to sprint at you know 50 of my all-out speed yeah so i always think of all-out speed
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:05.360]   for me as um somebody's chasing me with a a syringe filled with poison okay and i've got to get away
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:13.120]   okay um that's all out speed i don't want to die so 50 of that 60 70 you know it's subject you know and
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.640]   i'm measuring it subjectively i'm not doing this by heart rates or anything like that and indeed
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:21.440]   anytime i've done a hundred percent all out like in my mind imagining you know someone trying to
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:25.920]   try to really take my life and i'm running all out i end up with this lower back thing because of the
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:31.680]   you know it you get hurt yeah um but striding sounds like something that people could work up to
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:38.640]   how do you know after doing the skip workout that you described that you're quote unquote ready to stride
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.960]   and start doing a stride workout and i should mention that the these workouts because we did
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:50.720]   one yesterday um you finish them feeling great this is an aspect of exercise that i think most people
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:56.480]   don't talk about unfortunately that this leave it all on the mat you know you take every set to failure
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:02.160]   in the gym or you're you know these long runs where you're just shredded that they're not great for
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:09.760]   teaching people how to be healthy because people are exhausted afterwards they're tired they over
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.600]   train quickly and then people say there's no such thing as over training it's like yeah if you can
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:18.400]   sleep all day eat all day and your profession is to do this but there is such a thing as having a
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.400]   stressful life and wanting to be healthy and exercising and trying to incorporate that in a way
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:27.520]   that feeds the rest of your life yeah and i think these workouts that we did the workout we did yesterday
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:34.720]   excuse me um left me feeling you know posturally energetically mood wise it's feeling great i slept
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:39.440]   great last night felt great this morning i had a great workout in the gym as i mentioned earlier so
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:45.440]   i want to encourage people to give this a try and in doing that i want to give them a road map so
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:53.520]   a warm-up of 10 to 15 minutes 50 meter or so skip um could they do it on lawn dirt or concrete does it
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:58:00.560]   matter no it doesn't great yeah if you've got a really flat grass perfect okay but if you if you
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.480]   don't and do it on concrete no problem okay so basically no cost to this except a little bit of
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:12.160]   time and attention um 10 to 15 of those you have 50 meters out walk back repeat after and if you need a
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:17.680]   little bit longer recovery than the probably 90 seconds it takes to walk back take it not a big deal the
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:23.680]   quality here is a term determining factor as you said you're not trying to get really fatigued from
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:29.680]   plyometric work this is a plyometric session you want to be kind of fresh going into each one and
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:36.080]   that's going to take you know for most people doing a maximal skip over the course of 50 50 meters it's
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:40.800]   90 seconds is about enough but if you're really explosive and you're a really good skipper it might
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:46.160]   be three minutes that's fine as you said you want to feel good at the end of that you don't want to
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:52.560]   be beasted at the end of that now if you can do it where you're if we transition say from the skips
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:56.720]   and you can stride really well and if you can stride really well maybe you can sprint really well
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:01.760]   really well that doesn't necessarily mean that you shouldn't be tired at the end of the session
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:08.560]   but the quality of the movement has to be the governor there not the capacity no i got to get
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:14.160]   the work done and i don't care how that work looks or what it looks like i just got to get it done no
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:20.080]   with high intense work with sprint work your your governor is always the quality of the work what does
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:25.280]   it look like what does it feel like it's a lot like resistance training in that way 100 always quality
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:31.680]   so um how does one transition into striding and what what what does that look like this is saying okay i'm
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:37.040]   gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna sprint but it's not a sprint because i'm gonna hold back a bit but how do you
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.600]   hold back and still have the expressive part because the expressive part it's a little hard to describe
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:47.200]   in words but yesterday you were encouraging rob and i to get us you know tall with our posture as if we're
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:51.840]   being pulled up by a string from our heads and it has a profound psychological effect and then you just
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:56.960]   feel your your body opening up in natural movement you don't have to think about coordinating the hand lift
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:03.280]   it's just you're in you know like this full bowing out it's really wonderful if we describe the
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:10.880]   difference between all of the gait patterns just through the amount of space that you take up on the
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:15.600]   planet so when you when you walk it's a small space and when you jog you're taking up a little bit more
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.480]   space and when you run it's a bit more space when you start to stride it's more space again and then when
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:25.040]   you sprint you're up here and you're being maximally expressive so just think about it from that
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:33.520]   perspective the other part is jogging and running typically happens behind your center mass you crash
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:38.880]   onto the ground and you push back you have this propulsive phase there's not a lot of a break of
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:44.800]   breaking phase here there's a long propulsive phase that happens with the foot pushing back behind the
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:51.520]   center mass striding and sprinting happens in front of the center mass there's an actually a longer
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:58.080]   eccentric phase where you drive a lot of force into the ground it's in front of the center mass and then
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.360]   you propel yourself off and it's a very short propulsive phase so think about it that way so it's a bigger
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:10.160]   shape and it's primarily more in front and it's also as i said this is important you can't sprint and
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.960]   most of the people that are listening to this cannot sprint are you telling us to not sprint no no i'm
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:21.600]   what i'm saying is you do not have that strategy available to you most of us like everybody who's
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.000]   listening to this almost everybody will be able to walk and if you can walk as you said you could
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:34.560]   probably jog and most of the people on the planet can walk jog and maybe they can run most people on the
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:40.240]   the planet can't stride they can't get any faster than 75 of what their capacity is because they will
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.920]   they just can't do that anymore if you're a kid you can do that you can run you can you can stride along
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.360]   all day but you get to a certain point where our tissues and our joint systems and we just do not have
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:58.640]   the capacity to run that fast safely and we definitely don't have it when we're sprinting and the difference
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:05.440]   here is when you're striding it's essentially a pretty simple traditional spring mass system
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:10.640]   the body acts as a spring just whether it's 50 on the front side 50 on the back side you hit
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.920]   and you bounce off you hit and you bounce off where sprinting is a little bit different this is the work
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:23.920]   of dr ken clark is a good friend of mine that he he published this in i think in 2018 19. it's called a
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   two mass system where it's not the body is not acting as a spring there's a secondary mass of the shank
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:36.480]   and the foot that's contributing to up to about eight percent of the total force through contact
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:43.040]   so this elite sprinter is hitting the ground so hard that so there's another mass that's added to the
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.400]   spring and that's what i'm saying that's not available to you because you can't move your limbs fast enough
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.960]   and you don't have the range of motion that's big enough to be able to get that sort of velocity
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:03:00.640]   there's a dozen players in the nfl that can do that every elite sprinter is actually a sprinter
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.760]   most every other athlete and most every other sport can't actually sprint they're just they're
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.240]   operating as spring mass they don't have that secondary mass because they can't move their limbs fast enough
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:17.200]   when dr peter tia was on this podcast and elsewhere he talked about one of the major causes of death
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:26.400]   mostly in older people is they'll fall they'll be mobile they'll catch some sort of infection
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:34.720]   um related to contact with the bed or um you know cert post-surgical lack of circulation and
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:40.240]   that's what takes them out i was shocked to learn this right i mean i thought it'd be heart attack or
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.440]   uh cerebrovascular disease or that instead but that led to this whole notion that i think is
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:50.240]   gaining more popularity nowadays that part of longevity is maintaining things like grip strength
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.360]   one's ability to jump and land and jumping and landing is eccentric control yeah
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.760]   my mom's turning 80 this year and she's fortunately in very good health
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.800]   my dad's already 80 he was on this podcast and for anyone that saw that he's clearly in very good health
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:15.520]   but i worry about them and i worry mostly about a step down off a curb a step going down a stairwell
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:21.200]   that is not controlled and then a slip and then a fall and then the break and then the immobility and
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:28.480]   then the the sequence that atiyah and others have referred to would skipping be a good activity for
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:35.520]   people in their 60s 70s or 80s to undertake carefully as a way to learn eccentric control
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:42.640]   because i'll be honest i've seen some wonderful inspiring videos of people in their 70s and 80s
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:51.200]   jumping off of boxes doing plyo type work in the gym i don't know many folks in their 70s and 80s who are
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.720]   going to see where we're going to embark on that yeah but you can skip kind of small skips then you
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.840]   can do larger skips you can skip anywhere it's free if you approach it carefully you probably don't even
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:09.040]   need a trainer there's some videos now of you having us skip and um i you know here i'm like inspired to
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:15.680]   start a skipping movement uh with you um for all these reasons uh you don't need even need a piece of
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:20.960]   equipment probably even do it barefoot on grass if you couldn't afford shoes right 100 what are your
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:28.960]   thoughts on folks who are um in the 16 up club yeah um skipping yeah i think you've nailed it i think
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:34.640]   that is so important that eccentric control or the eccentric capacity is the one that we really lose
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.120]   the ability to handle ourselves eccentrically is just it's it's we don't do that work anymore
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:47.520]   everything that we do is concentric in nature and uh it is it's not just elite sport i said before that
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:57.280]   the differentiator is always in the eccentric force capacities in elite sport also in us in gen pop
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:05.440]   we have we lose the ability to apply eccentric force whether it's fast or maximal so 100 i think it's
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:14.480]   so important my dad um was an elite athlete when he was younger and has probably averaged four days a
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:22.800]   week running for almost his entire life good for him yeah he's 78 in 2019 he ran the new york city
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:32.560]   marathon ran 502 so he's at at 74 or 73 years old and he doesn't do that anymore but he still runs four
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:38.800]   days a week and he runs about 20 to 25 miles and two of those days are skipping sessions where
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:46.080]   he walks 30 seconds he skips for 30 seconds and then he strides as fast as he can as fast as his
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:51.920]   capacity will allow for 30 seconds and then he walks then he skips and then he strides and he walks and
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:59.280]   it's it's it's so key it really is like it's it's for me like the ability to express yourself maximally
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:05.040]   through running and i've already said i don't feel like most people can do this
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:14.160]   i don't know if there is a better single metric to as a measurement for whatever word you want to use
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:24.080]   here vitality or health than the ability to safely express maximal speed of that you as you as an individual
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.760]   like you choose vo2 max you choose all of these different things that you might come up with
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.320]   i don't feel like any of them are as good as the ability to just
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:39.760]   run maximally so let's start with that if we feel like that is important and you can argue whether it
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.720]   whether it's the the most important or the 10th most important we know it's important
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:48.960]   if we know that's important how do we get there and as you said i think skipping is the way so i'm on
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.120]   board with the skipping movement let's get everybody skipping because it is as i said this is your
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:59.120]   ability to be plyometric to work on those eccentric force capacities and move in a way in which you can
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:06.080]   actually express yourself again there's this um peculiarity to um anything related to health
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:13.520]   and public health in particular uh for instance a colleague of mine at stanford um dr david spiegel he's
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:19.040]   our uh vice chair of psychiatry and he and his father actually founded this area of psychiatry which
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:25.840]   is basically hypnosis for the treatment of trauma for pain relief for smoking cessation and there are
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.280]   tremendously good data to support it as a practice it's actually approved by the american psychiatric
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:37.520]   association one of only four i think behavioral things uh emdr cognitive behavioral therapy hypnosis and i
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:45.760]   think there's another in any case the problem it's called hypnosis and people hear hypnosis yeah and
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:53.280]   their mind goes to balking and squawking like a chicken on a stage this is why we refer to deliberate
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:57.440]   respiration as opposed to breath work in our studies our clinical trials on that which david and i have
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:07.520]   published and published et cetera and it's it's not euphemism the the issue is the name is a separator
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:14.960]   often and that's a shame when there's a practice that's very valuable yoga nidra non-sleep deep rest right
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:22.320]   right yeah i have tremendous respect for yoga nidra and and all of its um early uh creators and but
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.760]   the language is a separator i'm sorry and there's a there's a public health mission
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:34.400]   that to me is more important than the naming just say that and i'll take the heat for it with no guilt
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:44.800]   whatsoever skipping unless it's skipping rope has this connotation of of childlike activity let's just be
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:52.960]   honest and adults doing childlike behavior while not necessarily a problem in its own right i mean look at
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:57.760]   all these adults with social media accounts acting like children and the children acting like adults
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:03.120]   different discussion entirely but what if we were to give it a different name not with the intention
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:10.080]   of pretending it's not skipping yeah but to relieve people's guilt and shame about doing it um is it
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:18.160]   bounding bounding is a little bit um more nondescript for most people um i'm having this conversation with
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.960]   you openly in public here in front of many many people um to illustrate a couple of points one is
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:28.720]   that the name often times and people like i'm not gonna skip down the street but there's so much value
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:34.720]   to this that i think it'd be a real shame to to lose the opportunity to have it um wick out to many many
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:42.400]   millions of people because it's called skipping yeah it's plyometrics it's plyometrics great love it and it is a
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:52.400]   like bounding is left to right so you're left right left right left right left bounding is really really
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:59.360]   difficult extremely challenging skipping is a regression from bounding so if you can't bound
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.760]   if you can bound great go and do some bounding chances are if you can't sprint you can't bound
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:09.120]   like it's really really hard to do real true you know high quality bounding we can all skip
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:16.800]   so look at it that way this is plyometrics this is just their your most simple and probably for most
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:25.200]   people your most effective means of giving your body a plyometric activity how else you know you're
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:31.280]   jumping onto the box not a plyometric that's all concentric it's basically useless it's a waste of time
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:37.600]   let's find eccentric things to do and what is your best eccentric or the war the one that is the
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.280]   simplest the one as you said we spent an entire childhood doing it's familiar to us there's something
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:49.440]   innate in this there really is skipping so just think about it as being a plyometric i'm going to do my
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:56.480]   plyos today and by the way this isn't something that i've just made up there is not a sprint group on the
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:05.360]   planet that don't skip every single sprinter skips every single one of them because of the of the
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:13.200]   importance of this specific gait pattern it's really important i love that thank you um and you also saved
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:20.240]   me from trying to find a name that uh you know um plyometric i'd like to take a quick break and
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:25.520]   acknowledge one of our sponsors function last year i became a function member after searching for the
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:31.680]   most comprehensive approach to lab testing function provides over 100 advanced lab tests that give you
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.800]   a key snapshot of your entire bodily health this snapshot offers you with insights on your heart
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:42.400]   health hormone health immune functioning nutrient levels and much more they've also recently added
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.880]   tests for toxins such as bpa exposure from harmful plastics and tests for pfaces or forever chemicals
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:53.680]   function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to your physical and mental health
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.720]   but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from top doctors who are expert in the
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.000]   relevant areas for example in one of my first tests with function i learned that i had elevated levels
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.200]   of mercury in my blood function not only helped me detect that but offered insights into how best to
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:14.800]   reduce my mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption i've been eating a lot of tuna while also
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.280]   making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with nac and acetylcysteine both of
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.400]   which can support glutathione production and detoxification and i should say by taking a second function test
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.840]   that approach worked comprehensive blood testing is vitally important there's so many things related
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:35.200]   to your mental and physical health that can only be detected in a blood test the problem is blood testing
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:40.720]   has always been very expensive and complicated in contrast i've been super impressed by function simplicity
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:46.000]   and at the level of cost it is very affordable as a consequence i decided to join their scientific
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.880]   advisory board and i'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.480]   you can go to functionhealth.com slash huberman function currently has a wait list of over 250 000
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:03.120]   people but they're offering early access to huberman podcast listeners again that's functionhealth.com
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:09.680]   slash huberman to get early access to function one thing that people will immediately realize when
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:15.920]   they go out and and skip when they do their plyometric skipping um that's a little bit hard to
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.000]   understand just from hearing us have this conversation but just trust me on this well the two things that
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.160]   are very surprising and immensely positive at least two things one is this expressive component and the
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.800]   way it reshapes your psychology and your mood i want to set that aside but make sure we return to that
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.440]   the other is the um cross body coordination of movement the fact that one knee is back toward
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.880]   the butt on one side and the opposite arm is raised up just naturally as you skip this is just you know
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:50.960]   in fact if you're wondering now oh goodness do i actually know how to skip um that occurred to me
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:54.800]   a couple times yesterday because i had many cameras on me i thought do i still remember how to skip i'd been
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.360]   skipping the night before in preparation i didn't know we were going to skip but i've always worked some skips
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:06.720]   in if nobody's looking i'm a skip in private kind of guy um until now until now now i skip with pride
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:12.640]   there you go in public um plyometrics i will plyometric in public that's right but one thing that was
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.720]   interesting i would think okay we'd get back after walking i think okay we're going to skip again
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:22.240]   how do i do this it's basically i would think about lunging kind of a fast lunge out and then it
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:29.360]   automatically would put me into that that motion of skipping yeah um but this cross body coordination
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:36.560]   is incredible for purposes of motor neuron coordination across the body for the fascial
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:40.960]   component can we talk a little bit more about cross body coordination because i'd like at some point to
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:45.360]   talk about sprinting a little bit because even if people aren't going to sprint this idea that when
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:50.480]   we're sprinting we're not just turning over our legs faster of course the arms are pumping but the
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:55.360]   arms and legs are coordinated in a very interesting way that the forces are actually running like a like
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:00.880]   an x from uh across from one shoulder down the leg and from the other shoulder which is going to sound
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:07.200]   very um complicated people but you'll explain it so cross body coordination um when we walk we do this
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:16.240]   some people don't they're kind of robotic yeah but most people flow their arms as they walk if if we
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:23.280]   were to put a camera above the earth and look down on everybody you would see this very distinctly at
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:31.120]   every single gate starting with walking we rotate so the the pelvis rotates up and down and forward and back
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:38.000]   so it oscillates and undulates and then the shoulders counter oscillate and counter undulate so the
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.640]   shoulders go back forward and backward and up and down just pay attention to this next time you're
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.800]   out for a walk you can feel your hips going backwards and forwards and also going up and down
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:51.440]   if they didn't go up and down you'd trip yourself every step and the shoulders do the same and then
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:56.480]   you have a spine which is this column of a bunch of different pieces that connects the shoulder to the
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:05.280]   pelvis which also rotates side bends and flexes and extends the whole system is this big torsional system
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:14.320]   this cross body system and some people take maximum utility of this system and you can see it like some
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.080]   of the best movers some of the best sprinters you just watch them and you can you can just see how
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:24.240]   they wind up and they coil into every single step and they just use this cross body coordination so
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:29.840]   effectively and as you said some others are just it doesn't seem like there's any rotation going on here at
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:36.480]   all what looks better to you who looks better it's the ones that are using this effectively that look
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.360]   okay that just looks better i don't know why necessarily but that looks way more athletic well
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:46.000]   think robot dance versus somebody who really knows how to move their hips and shoulders in coordination
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.640]   we'll talk about dance a little bit later you have an interesting relationship to music that i think is
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:56.560]   very relevant here we'll get back to that but i'm seeding the conversation but yeah it's um when the
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.520]   shoulders and the hips are moving in unison it's it's like magic it really is yeah it really is
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.080]   and just feel this when you walk like when you're going out for your next walk just try to pay attention
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.560]   to what your shoulders are doing and what your hips are doing and start thinking am i getting my knee
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:17.760]   behind my butt when i'm walking and what does that feel like at my hip flexor my quad and as i do that
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:22.960]   what's happening with the opposite shoulder and is that getting wound up and is that coiling properly
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:32.320]   am i taking advantage of these extremely innate extremely natural movement tendencies that we all
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:37.280]   have or have i because of the way in which i've lived or some of the things that i've done or maybe even
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:43.360]   some of the things that somebody's told me tried to be really square and linear with everything i've done
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.880]   because think about it right when we're taught to run when we're younger any excessive movement
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:55.600]   outside of in a straight line has been told to us oh that's inefficient you're wasting energy you're
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:03.200]   bleeding all your all your force not understanding the actual biomechanical mechanism of the pelvis the
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:09.360]   shoulders and the spine that connects them and how we are actually built to rotate into bend you know so
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:16.400]   it's and that's not to say by the way that more is better everything is a is an inverted u in this
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:22.000]   world almost you know there's a goalie locks effect to this it's what is right for you some people will
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.120]   use this torsional system extremely effectively and there'll be a lot of it and some will be a little
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.000]   bit less they're a little bit more linear and they'll still be good that's all dependent upon their own
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.040]   individual and unique structure their morphology their genetics how they're built and how they're born
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:44.640]   what to do what they do with it as they as they age but the bottom line is we are all rotational beings
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.800]   and we need to try to find ways to take advantage of those rotational forces rather than to constrain
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:59.600]   them it's one of the reasons why i really dislike this anti-rotation um terminology that's come into many of
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:05.280]   the exercise many of the exercises that we do in the weight room this exercise is about anti-rotation
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:13.920]   why do you want to be anti-rotation we are rotational beings you're anti-excessive rotation but not anti-rotation
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:19.120]   so i feel like that just as you were saying before with skipping that's the wrong terminology for me and
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:24.720]   that's just sending the entirely the wrong message to everybody about the importance of us being a
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:32.560]   rotational being yeah naming matters it does especially in in exercise and anything related to um
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:39.200]   uh dare i call it wellness anything mental health physical health and performance the naming matters
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:45.360]   because it can take people's minds off track from the the major point it can uh be a separator as we
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:53.520]   mentioned before in the best case it can be uh an aggregator um i have to wonder with people walking
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:21:00.320]   around looking at their phones all the time are they losing the cross-body coordination i i um snuck in
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:08.000]   because i uh to one talk at south by southwest i got a ticket i got a pass i don't mean i snuck in i
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.760]   mean i i went there for just one talk the other day and i was walking through the hallways this is a big
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:19.520]   meeting tons of people and it was incredible everyone was walking looking at their phone now of course
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.560]   there's a program that's on an app these days so you're saving paper so that's good right but it
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:31.760]   was remarkable people were like walking and reading at the same time so i don't want to make more of
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:38.080]   this than we have data for but this can't be good this can't be good i think that's a really good point
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.160]   i haven't i haven't thought about that actually but i think that's a really good point i have a rule when
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:47.520]   i'm walking that if i if my phone buzzes and i want to pick up my phone i stop i stop i get out of
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:52.240]   the way of all the other walkers i push myself up against the building and i look to what's on my phone
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:58.000]   if i feel it's important and then i start walking again i i just despise people who walk and look at
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   the phone at the same time because that's what you see you see this unnatural constrained overly flexed
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.040]   posture and if you spend too much time doing that i don't think you need data you know that's not good
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.280]   it's not good to walk that way that's not the way we're supposed to walk again it's all about coming
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:21.920]   back to let's express ourselves let's understand what our bodies are supposed to be able to do and find
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:29.520]   ways to continue to have that ability as we age this isn't it let's talk about expression through
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:37.520]   movement um and let's use the extremes as a starting point i find that useful in any kind of scientific
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:45.040]   conversation you take the extreme outcome so um the person who is trying to take up as little space as
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:50.800]   possible chin toward the chest folded in thumbs toward the midline so-called internal rotation
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:58.640]   eyes down trying to make themselves small i don't need to spend another five seconds explaining all the
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.520]   psychological phenotypes that's associated with and the way it makes us feel now of course it's possible
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:08.880]   to curl up in a small ball and think amazing things about the world and oneself but generally that those
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:14.880]   things are not um happening at the same time let's think about the other extreme and let's talk about
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:19.920]   him usain bolt this will also be a fun opportunity for people to learn a little bit more about usain
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:20.720]   let's start there
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:28.720]   what is so special about usain bolt besides the fact that he's still the fastest man in the world
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:35.600]   and what about his willingness to express himself do you think contributed to becoming the fastest
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.480]   person in the world not just feeling great that he's the fastest guy in the world and therefore who
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:48.480]   wouldn't feel great yeah yeah usain is is unique if we look over the history of some of the elite male
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:56.160]   sprinters there was a time you know when i started getting into the sport the way to be as an elite male
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:05.120]   sprinter was hyper focused hyper intense if we think about mo green stalking behind his blocks and licking
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:12.880]   his lips getting ready for this basically he's going to war and it seemed like so many of the sprinters
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:19.680]   were trying to encapsulate this kind of feeling like sprinting is it's macho it's ego it's i'm i'm
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:26.480]   coming here to knock you out and then usain came along with the exact opposite and i think you know
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:32.080]   it's just he's out there having fun he's as i told the story about jody a little bit earlier right she was
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:39.040]   for a long time she would didn't connect herself with the activity they were two separate beings
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:44.080]   she was doing something that no she no longer really connected with and usain they're like this
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:51.360]   like he was really expressing his entire being in his in the way in which he went around about this
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.800]   task of sprinting 100 meters or sprints in 200 meters and i feel like that is such an important
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:02.720]   piece at all with all sport and probably with on within all things you know if you can connect your
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:09.200]   entire way of being with the thing that you're spending most of your time doing chances are you're
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.600]   going to be really successful at that thing and if you look at all the other sports right it's it's
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.200]   the ones that you can tell they're just really confident in who they are in what they do how
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:23.680]   they express themselves and whether and that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:29.120]   usain bald and playing around at the line and doing things like this and you know jumping around and
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:33.920]   that's he always like that does anyone know when he was a kid oh no he's yeah he's he's he's a kid
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:41.360]   he's a big kid he still is he's he's he's just uh you know he brings this this this really childlike
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.760]   intensity to things like he's still intense he's still he wants to kill you but he's you know he'll
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:54.000]   laugh in your face just before he does it you know like i i love that about him but when but that's not
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.240]   everybody that's not every elite sprinter i coached a guy named uh andre degrasse for for a while
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:05.120]   who won three olympic medals in 2016 i remember coming right behind usain bolt in that name in
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:12.160]   that famous 200 meters where they were smiling at each other um andre is very quiet very kind
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:18.160]   of type b kind of just down here very insular on his phone not really living life kind of lived life
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:23.600]   down here very closed and that's the way in which he performed that's the way he practiced that's the
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:29.600]   way he trained that's the way he competed he didn't feel like he had to be up here and bouncing
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.560]   around jumping around because that was not him and if there's one thing that andre is famous for
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:41.760]   and he's now got seven olympic medals i don't think i don't know how many big races andre has won
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:49.600]   outside of the olympic games but he's got seven olympic medals he's he he really stands up when it
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.360]   matters because he is connected with who he is he knows who he is and and what he brings out to the
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:02.320]   performance arena is connected like this with that where others and i mean the biggest example that i
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:10.480]   know is asafa powell so if anyone knows doesn't know who asafa powell is asafa was usain bolt before
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:19.520]   usain bolt asafa's ran sub 10 seconds in 100 meters 99 times more than anyone else in history he's by all
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:26.000]   intents and purposes one of the greatest male sprinters of all time he's a legend he's he's
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.720]   he's had a world record i think he's had set two world records he's an incredible sprinter who's choked
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:39.360]   at every single major championships has ever been he's always folded and he does that because he feels
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:45.920]   like he came up in the era of mo green you know this this animal thing this being really really super
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:52.000]   intense so asafa tried to be that that didn't work for him and then bernard williams who's kind
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.920]   of jumping around and playing around a little bit that's that became a thing for a while so asafa tried
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:01.760]   that hat on that didn't work either and then usain came and it's saying is usain is playing with the
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:07.600]   camera and being bringing his personality out so asafa tried that hat on guess what that didn't work either
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:19.440]   so there's this yeah usain brought this almost um yeah it's okay to j to be to jump around and to dance
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:26.160]   and have fun but it's not for everybody if that's not who you are and i feel like that was an important
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:32.160]   thing if i was coaching asafa say man asafa just be you man like you're relaxed you're you're andre degrasse
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:37.280]   before andre degrasse came along you're just you're just cool and chill just be cool and chill man
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.240]   just be that just bring you to this performance and you'll you'll get a lot more out of yourself
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:46.480]   but uh you know to get back to your question usain just gave everybody i think the permission
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:52.000]   to to have fun like that's why we do this thing is to have fun and if you're not having fun then why are we
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:01.680]   bothering it's so interesting you know and his name comes up so often now and i'm grateful to have him
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:08.800]   as a close friend but you know i've had hours upon hours of conversations with rick rubin about why
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:15.120]   certain musical artists just have that thing um and it doesn't matter if you're talking about tom petty
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:21.680]   joe strummer johnny cash adele it's just you you ask about all these different people and it's
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:30.720]   the answer is always the same it's they know how to be themselves in that moment yeah and people will
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:36.000]   say well it's a constructive his rick will be like no this is why he likes to work with artists early on
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:43.200]   like a lot of the hip-hop artists he worked with a lot of the punk rock music artists he worked with
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.720]   they were just being themselves they had no success prior to their
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:55.040]   you know like ll cool j sending him a demo tape and so there was no self-awareness or there wasn't
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:30:00.960]   enough self-awareness to hinder their expression they were just being them and that's always what
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:06.080]   explodes people to immense success now there's something to be said for ignorance isn't there
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:11.440]   there's something to be said for ignorance and there's something of a gravitational pull as an as a
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:20.480]   spectator or a listener uh to the artist the athlete the musician who's just being themselves
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:26.160]   and we know we can detect at an unconscious level when it's not real you know there's one of the
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:30.800]   things i love so much about podcasting or at least i'm very blessed to be in the earlyish cohort of
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:36.480]   podcasters i wasn't in the first cohort like the dan carlins and the rogan's but i came in early enough
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:41.040]   that none of us really knew what to do except just be ourselves it's a so now it's changing
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:47.040]   there's a big flood of commercial um you know uh entities and podcasting and some of those are are
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.360]   good and and most of them are not frankly because they're not real they're more like a new show it's
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:56.960]   produced it's like it's not real the person on camera and off camera are very different but i can
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:03.200]   tell you that joe rogan off camera that's rogan yeah um and i was thinking about really expressive
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:08.480]   people in different domains to compare more or less to this example that you were describing with
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:16.320]   usain so rogan i threw out the muhammad ali big yeah boisterous personality huge attractor to him
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:22.240]   it was not a construction he might have honed it as part of his craft but clearly that's who he was
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:30.160]   he's a fast talker yeah um mike tyson mike tyson very different yeah but that's him right you know right and
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:35.360]   everyone loves mike tyson because it's very clear that that is mike tyson jean-michel basquiat
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:41.040]   yeah you know this like even just the size of the paintings and the way he worked and the physicality
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:47.520]   of it um he was haitian i'm gonna get back to this kind of nationality thing a little bit later
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:52.400]   and then we had on here the great josh waitskin who was the subject of the movie the search for bobby
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:59.040]   fisher and um his whole strategy in chess that he learned in washington square park of creating chaos
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:04.400]   on the chessboard this game that everyone considers very very linear and very very constrained and his
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:10.640]   he liked to create chaos because washington square park especially in the 80s and 90s chaos you know
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:18.240]   drug dealers and crime and there's people uh doing it pretty much every activity there um and and and on
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:23.040]   and on right you know i think that when people are just being themselves this is what you're saying
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:30.720]   and this is what rick has said over and over you know that that essence piece is so magnificent
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:40.800]   and um not just to see but it it evolves humankind it really does and um so when you work with an athlete
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:46.080]   or for the listener who's trying to figure out well like who am i does it work in reverse meaning
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:54.880]   and i believe that movement can actually teach us who we are in addition to allow us to express who we
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:33:03.120]   are and i'm not going to say that skipping is the only way to do that but it was very interesting yesterday
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:10.800]   to notice the transitions in my state of mind as i got permission from you uh to you know go bigger
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:17.920]   get bigger stride bigger yeah and we were the adults on the kids playground in my mind behaving like
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:26.560]   kids but it it is transformative i think to move differently makes you feel different and when those
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:32.000]   things line up i think is what you're talking about yeah i think it's a brilliant question i really do think it's
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:40.480]   it's it's everything in sport but i think as you said just when you zoom out it's not just sport it's all
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:50.400]   everything and i feel like so so often in sport specifically people like me steal the essence away from
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:58.080]   the athletes because we have our own preconceived ideas of what this that what you should be doing
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:04.800]   should look like and it's my idea but it's not your essence and it's not your idea and i always feel
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:12.880]   like we should be coaching towards what the athlete's best solution is not what our best solution is i've
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.920]   got i've got an athlete i'm working with right now who's super gifted she's a two-time olympian she's
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:24.560]   got olympic gold medal on the relay and she's been coached for a long time to move in a way that does
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:31.280]   not align with her essence it does not align with what she is good at and what what will that do to
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:37.200]   you over the course of time it's obviously going to negatively affect your confidence it definitely
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:42.000]   negatively affects your the way you move because you're in a move you're moving in a way that just
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.720]   doesn't align with you whether that's psychologically emotionally or physically biomechanically
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:56.000]   so this is a tall elastic expressive sprinter who's been taught to be really small and compact and
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.240]   accelerate with really short choppy steps and she's lost the ability to even understand who she is anymore
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:12.720]   in this sport so my objective now is try to reintroduce herself to herself what was it that got you into this
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:20.480]   how did you move why were you really really good at this let's reconnect with that and the challenging
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:26.960]   piece with that is how do you understand what that is especially years if you've been being taught a
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:33.680]   certain way that is not in alignment with who you are whether that is sport or anything else it's really
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:39.440]   difficult to reconnect with it if you don't have a really good guide because so often those guides and
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:47.200]   it's that's that's whether it's a coach or a music producer will screw them up not not purposefully
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:52.240]   you know they're coming at this from a very optimistic standpoint a positive standpoint i'm
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:57.760]   trying to help you andrew this is but this is what i think these are my experiences this is my
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:04.240]   subjective view this is how i see you doing the thing that you're doing and that's based on my history
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:09.360]   rather than where it should be and that's based on your history and that's that's the difference
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:14.880]   between a rick rubin and many other producers and it's the difference between elite coaches and sub elite
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:21.760]   coaches you always start with the person what is the unique ability that you have what is it that you
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.880]   have that makes you better than everyone else what is it you have that that really that you want to
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:34.720]   show everyone let's connect with that let's show that let's just let's build all of our training around
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:41.200]   that let's have all of our conversations around that i'm remembering the example from that documentary
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:48.080]   last the last dance about michael jordan um some of the description of the chicago bulls coach
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:57.520]   encouraging dennis rodman who in the 90s was 80s 90s like first of all very few people had that many
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:06.560]   tattoos who weren't in prison or um in a niche music community right dennis had a ton of tattoos he had
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:14.080]   earrings he dyed his hair he loved to party he was wild and his coach understood that it was part of his
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:21.520]   reset mechanism and you you don't put um a bulldog in a race with a bunch of greyhounds and you don't
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:27.040]   have greyhounds tug a rope with a kettlebell on the end i know this as a bulldog owner who loves all
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:34.080]   breeds of dogs so he gave dennis permission to party yeah what no professional coach would probably do
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:39.920]   and it brought out his ability to play brilliant um you know incredible rebounder incredible player all
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:48.880]   around but you know famous for his rebound uh stats so this thing of of who am i how do i express
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:54.640]   myself i think the the authenticity piece is so key like if you're a nice person being a jerk in your
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:59.440]   sport is probably not going to work um but if you enjoy competition and you're a nice person then it
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:05.600]   seems like there's a place for that and i wonder whether or not a big component of all of this and
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:10.800]   discovering it for for people that are going to try plyometric skipping and these sorts of things to
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:15.360]   try and better understand themselves and express themselves which i think would be a wonderful
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:24.400]   thing to come from this discussion is the trying to shut down the self-conscious part this the the self
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:30.480]   critic do you think the best sprinters are also not thinking about anyone else they're just enjoying
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:37.600]   themselves or at least are they feeling the sprint more than they're paying attention to their form
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:43.680]   as a like how does this look so i'm thinking about it i'm on the track with you i'm gonna i'm gonna run
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:51.600]   or skip and i can either just feel where it's more expressive or i can try and show you that it's more
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:58.000]   expressive two different very different things one that's a there's a self-conscious awareness piece the
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.280]   showing you i'm going to show you this as opposed to just doing it for the feel of it yeah is that
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:10.000]   the distinction yeah that's a really good way to put it um one really good example of this in the sprints
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.240]   world and i think you were there for this is 2022 world championships in oregon yeah i was there and uh
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:22.000]   noah lyle's won the 200 in an american record 1931. and that was for me
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:30.720]   like that's the epitome of just being so lost in what you're doing that you have no idea what you're
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:37.680]   looking like and he's just maximally expressing his everything that he's got and he he bounds across
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:44.480]   the line i said man that was beautiful like i've never seen that like it was so beautiful like totally
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:52.160]   lost in flow and that it doesn't happen as often as many who don't work in sport think it does not every
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:56.880]   single performance is a flow performance but if you're lucky you'll get one or two of those in
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:03.040]   your career where you just lose connection with everything that you're doing and you just wow what
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:14.160]   happened and in fact every time that a sprinter sets a personal best i ask him what was that feeling like i
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:21.840]   don't know no idea i don't know i don't know how that felt i just ran so all of these things that we
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.120]   we talked about all of these incredible coaching cues that i gave you to think about when you were doing
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:34.960]   this you forgot them all so i just ran i just ran and almost always that is the answer to that i just ran
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:41.120]   and i just connected with it and something in the background you know we were able to one of the
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:49.520]   ways and i'll i'll bring this um home a little bit more maybe practically so we train 20 to 25 hours a
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:55.920]   week and my goal each day is not to say a lot like i want the athlete to kind of find a way through
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:01.440]   things and i will encourage them and guide them and sort of facilitate this discovery but often we'll talk
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:05.280]   about different things and if they're having if they're struggling with something i'll give them a
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:11.680]   a specific cue and over the course of time we build you know this library of different things that the
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:18.480]   athlete thinks about or the different cues and then my objective coming into more of a competitive season
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:26.640]   is to try to align these cues with an emotion what i call what are called mood words so for example
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.560]   when an athlete is accelerating they're on the ground for a little bit longer than when they
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.120]   are upright because they need to actually propel themselves forward they need horizontal force they
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:42.320]   need the ground to push themselves forward so they push and they push or they drive so cues could be
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:48.240]   drive it could be push it could be power it could be pull your thighs forward it could be all of these
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:54.640]   different things that are around power but for me the mood word that really expresses this better than
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:42:01.360]   not anything is pressure i want you to feel like you're applying as much pressure through the first
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:07.760]   half of this race as you possibly can and the second half of the race is the exact opposite of that so we
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:13.760]   talk about things that we do technically knees up thighs up step off the ground be vertical be be
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:20.960]   expressive be tall all of these different cues but really what we're trying to get to is freedom or peace
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:27.040]   so that's what a hundred meter sprint is it's 50 meters of pressure and 50 meters of peace
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:34.960]   so i try to align these mood words with these coaching instructions and then all the athletes
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:39.680]   need to think about is this emotion or this mood word and all the instructions come along for the ride
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:46.320]   that is the goal and that is you know going back to it something we talked about quite a while ago now
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:53.360]   probably one of the things that i love the most around 100 meters is this dichotomous relationship
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:43:03.440]   between pressure and peace or power and fluidity or violence and rhythm all of these things that are the
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:10.800]   opposing ends of the spectrum that every single elite athlete regardless of the sport can come together
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:17.600]   perfectly if you can have the power but if you don't have the peace good luck you can have the peace but
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:24.560]   if you don't have the power good luck no chance it's always both simultaneously so it's um yeah that's that's
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:32.480]   the that's the massive challenge in in this sport and going back to uh to noah in 2022 that world
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:38.560]   championship uh final in the 200. incredible i said that's maybe the best example of that i've ever seen
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:45.760]   yeah amazing amazing race really was really feel blessed to have been there and by the way folks
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:52.480]   if you have never been to a track meet it's for for many reasons it's one of the most wonderful things
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:59.520]   first of all it will give you an example of what real coordination is all about and i'm not talking about
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:06.400]   physical coordination although that too you'll be watching the pole vault and then you'll shift your
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:10.160]   eyes to the right and there'll be another event starting right as the pole vault ends and then
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:16.960]   another one it's a it's a beautifully orchestrated event done properly as they do in eugene and elsewhere
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:24.160]   the other piece is that um nobody goes to track meets unless they love track although hopefully a few
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:30.160]   people uh who are not familiar with track will try it and so every the the amount of spirit there is
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:38.160]   incredible um and there's also i don't know that there's a lot of identification with individuals
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:43.200]   there that even if you've never seen them run or anything you you pick up on the different um
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:49.040]   on the different personalities of of the the runners and the jumpers and the throwers and um
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:53.280]   it's really special check out a track meet if you can you won't be disappointed absolutely you won't
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:58.240]   be disappointed and i don't work for usa track and you know people are like do you work for big track no
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:06.560]   actually i don't i buy a ticket like everybody else um this notion of pressure and peace
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:12.560]   you know it brings me back to this thing about these transition activities like for songwriters even you
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:17.920]   know who are so skilled joanie mitchell or you know i was referring to earlier you know tim armstrong you
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:24.880]   know having these transition activities you know trying to um to get into one's craft and and the the
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:30.800]   pressure and then it kind of opens up into peace and um i feel like anytime rick is talking about
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:36.000]   working with musicians and i was like how'd it go you know he's in the studio and it's like they work
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:42.240]   super hard they work extremely hard and then it's always the story i always hear is oh yeah in the last
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:47.600]   two days it all came together yeah right because they set real deadlines right and i think this is
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:54.080]   why deadlines are important this is why um writers and artists who have no deadlines oftentimes don't
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:59.680]   do as well and maybe athletes as well that the pressure piece of getting everything organized around
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:05.520]   an activity and then the nervous system just kind of takes it yeah the commonalities here are are
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:13.360]   fascinating uh to me maybe we all could approach our exercise that way too that it's okay to be rigid rigidly
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:19.760]   attached to to detail at the beginning but the goal is peace in the final minutes of it right yeah i think
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:25.040]   that's a good way of looking at it yeah i think you know more than that if we zoom out i feel like
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:38.320]   you know society or the way in which we think about exercise now has become detached from why why we
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:44.160]   actually started doing the things to begin with movement right we fall in love with finding our way
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:49.120]   around the world through moving our bodies in space and time doing whatever whether that's hiking or
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:55.920]   playing a sport or whatever and then we finish school and we get a job and now we don't really move anymore
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:03.760]   that becomes exercise and we go to the gym and we exercise and i feel like that's so many degrees
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:11.360]   removed from why we actually do the thing i feel like we don't ask ourselves is this what is really
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:17.200]   serving me or is this what everyone else is doing so i'm just going to go along with it and for me
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:23.840]   like i lift weights i go to the weight room i do that four or five days a week i skip every single
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:28.960]   day i run like three or four days a week i do some boxing i move my body i play i do as many different
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:35.200]   things i can i can do includes hiking and i feel like that's what we should be doing i'm asking myself
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:43.360]   what is it that i want to get out of this practice is it i want to go to the gym for 45 45 minutes a day
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:48.480]   and get as strong as i can or as big as i can whatever and if that if that is it great but i need
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:54.320]   to ask myself that question i don't feel like many of us are asking that question and for me we've
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:01.360]   alluded to this a couple times now is you know what's important about moving as we're aging and being
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:07.600]   connected with that and having the ability to continue to be able to you know express ourselves
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:13.840]   maximally over the course of our lifetimes that isn't developed in a weight room that's developed by doing
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:19.600]   those things you know you you might appreciate this like if you were looking if you were looking for
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:28.880]   good movement would you go to a weight room or a skate park definitely to escape park 100 yeah
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:34.400]   because the movers are so much better like the movement there is wow this is incredible don't you
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.920]   want to be able to do that rather than do a squat there's some made-up exercise that somebody's told you
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:43.840]   that is going to be you know do this and this and this for you or do a deadlift or do a bench press
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:49.680]   all these made-up things and as i said those things can be good can be fun can be interesting can be
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:55.440]   important but what really is most important is can you still move your body can you express yourself
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.880]   maximally for as long into your lifetime as you possibly can and people i feel like they have to ask
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:06.640]   the question whether the thing that they're doing is exercise is it actually leading to that
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:13.680]   and in most cases i think it's not i came up in part through skateboarding that was my main focus
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:19.440]   in high school up until about mid-high school and i got into other things um skateboarding everything
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:27.520]   you're saying is especially true the personality matches the way they skateboard uh level of aggression
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:35.200]   level of technicality personality i mean sometimes there's a mismatch like there's a the every vert
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:38.720]   skateboarder big ramp skateboarder now will attest i mean everyone from tony hawk because i've heard
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:45.520]   him say it um uh to everyone i know that there's a there's a kid um named jimmy wilkins um who
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:53.600]   does everything faster bigger with more technical ability than anybody's ever seen he's a absolutely
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:50:02.000]   remarkable um addition to the sport and a super nice kid his mom's a ballerina oh yeah amazing and he's got
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:08.880]   very um loose hip joints he actually guides the board with his knee back knee like so he can do a
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:15.440]   lot of things hands with no hands that most people have to grab to do and his dad is uh an orchestra
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:21.280]   conductor so if you were to like make up a story about a highly technical powerful precise you know
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:28.240]   athlete it would be jimmy wilkins and it's um he's he's he's won x games he's astonishing um to watch
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:34.400]   and so much fun to watch so skateboarding it's very apparent um but then i was trying to think of some
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:38.800]   daily activities that so getting away from sport and exercise for a moment and i was just thinking in my own
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:48.880]   life like if you wanted to understand um my mom you just have to see her gardening the way she moves about her
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:54.800]   garden the way she tends to it she loves gardening it's like her greatest i don't know if it's her
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:59.760]   greatest joy it's one of her great joys and so if you if you could just see her gardening for
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:06.640]   10 minutes you would understand her as a person uh completely amazing it's it's amazing and and i think
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:10.000]   she's a very good gardener but it's not that the garden isn't the point it's how she moves about the
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.440]   garden yep um and i think that's true for certain people how they cook certain people how they dance
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:19.200]   and i was going to say you know if you want to understand people at a wedding or a party
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:24.480]   just when the music comes on you get a lot of insight into people's personality and the best is always
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:30.160]   that like older guy or or gal or couple that look like they're just kind of sitting there like turtles
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:34.000]   and then they get up and you're like oh my goodness they can really dance yeah or they're just enjoying
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:39.440]   or just enjoying it completely even if they're not great dancers yeah so let's talk about music and
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:49.040]   dance for a second i think we can't avoid this any longer um your instagram handle was maybe still is
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:54.160]   finger mash correct i thought that had something to do with sprinting but i learned right before we sat down
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:01.760]   that you're you you're a reggae dj uh-huh and you grew up around that yeah and sprinting has a lot of
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:09.760]   jamaicans in it yeah what's the deal educate us um how much of how you understand athletes and how they
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:15.200]   move and people generally in the general population how they move um relates to your understanding kind
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:19.600]   of music and rhythm because this pressure piece right i mean like that's a great song that's a great
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:27.120]   concert that's a great album so you know i don't think i explicitly truly understood the connection
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:32.320]   until in hindsight you know because when you're doing it you're just doing it you're just living
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.560]   your life and you're not really thinking about it i'm doing these things they have creative
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:42.960]   probably similarities but i'm not really understanding those you know i'm not thinking about them you know
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:50.640]   i started uh i started djing in 1984 so i've been 15 and i stopped djing in 2010 i had a radio show in
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:55.760]   calgary for 20 years called level the vibes shout out level the vibes it still goes on to this day level
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:01.600]   of vibes level the vibes level the vibes level the vibes with my old dj partner tulla yeah and uh it's
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:07.840]   yeah absolutely like it's i was an artist as well so when i was in school everyone figured i would just be
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.120]   the artist like i was an okay athlete but not great i wasn't good enough to go into professional
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:20.400]   sport and make money it was just art that was it i went to art school and i figured out you know this
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:25.040]   just isn't serving me anymore but the entire time i'm doing this music thing and i'm doing this sport
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:30.880]   thing and i think all of these creative outlets are just all coming together i've always been sort of a
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:36.880]   creative coach and i think like this is how i actually got into sprinting is i was a soccer player
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:42.800]   most of my most of my friends were sprinters most of them most of those sprinters because i was based in calgary
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:48.720]   there's a big jamaican population there so most of them were jamaican and i just got into sprinting through that
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:55.840]   so is uh i feel like as as i said it's it wasn't an explicit connection that i understood at the time
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:54:05.120]   but in hindsight i could say okay me being a a dj an understanding rhythm and putting things together
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:12.320]   and how putting these things together influenced other things less than maybe the people that i'm
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:21.360]   playing the music for that really served my coaching ability 100 100 as did my art
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:27.680]   it's really interesting in hindsight to to look at those things and look at those as you say these
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:32.960]   call them the transition events and these other things the other skills that you know masters in
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:39.440]   some of the domains have what athletes nowadays um which athletes are you excited about because they
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:44.880]   seem to have this essence we don't want to make them self-conscious but um that you're like wow like
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:50.720]   there's really something there yeah yeah who are you excited about in track specifically yeah or
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:58.560]   well any sport sure it's i mean i honestly i'm not a massive sports fan like i don't watch a lot
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:03.840]   of team sports in fact i watch no team sports other than soccer and i watch soccer because you know
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:08.720]   that's the game i played that's the game my father plays your team uh manchester city and so who's the
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:12.960]   greatest soccer player in the world in your mind for you like the one that not necessarily the one that
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:17.840]   everyone agrees is the best but oh no messi is the best player and i think most people would agree that
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:24.800]   leon messi is now playing for inter inter miami is maybe even still at the age of 35 or 36 the best
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:29.280]   player on the planet because of his expressiveness just the the way in which he plays his game and
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:36.080]   expresses himself is just perfect and in fact this is a really good uh analogy to to discuss what you're
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:41.680]   talking about here because there's there's in the goat debate the greatest of all time debate there's
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:47.600]   two players that come up in soccer cristiano ronaldo and leonel messi maradona is no longer in the next
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:53.360]   and pelle is no longer in the in the mix it's the it's these two okay ronaldo is 40 and messi i think
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:59.520]   is 36 and i'd say probably if you took a poll of all of the millions of people that have an opinion on
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:07.440]   this 45 of them or so would say cristiano ronaldo and 55 it's that close 55 would say messi but both
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:16.000]   of them are so authentically themselves it's crazy like cristiano ronaldo is perfect like he is the
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:22.960]   perfect greek god he's 40 years old he's about five percent body fat he's big muscular powerful fast it's
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:29.760]   always load shot he's shining he shines he literally he gleams he does yeah and he plays that way right
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:34.880]   and he's he's just got a certain personality that he brings to the field and messi's just like this
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:40.400]   you know just glides around and just elusive and you can't see him and oh there he's over there and
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:45.280]   just the things that he can do with his feet and the ball and the interaction between his feet and the
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:52.160]   ball it's just oh that's incredible and for me i align with more of the messy you know i just love
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:58.720]   the creativity that's a player like that has or uh or in you know a little bit more um up to date maybe
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:05.840]   you know uh steph steph curry like change the game of basketball totally be wild or through being
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:12.080]   authentically himself he's totally changed the league he's changed how everybody plays basketball and
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:18.240]   how and everybody will play basketball forevermore so it's yeah it's it's i really really appreciate
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:26.320]   incredibly beautiful and authentic movers i don't like sport but i love the the movement part of it
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:33.360]   yeah it's the son of an argentine you know my dad's first generation immigrant to the united states i i um
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:41.840]   i really put myself to shame by not being a huge soccer fan but i've got cousins that you'll listen and
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:46.560]   watch at the dinner table and you couldn't distract them if an atom bomb went off you know it's and
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:52.720]   his kids you know um such a such an interesting sport because of the this notion that different
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:58.640]   teams and different players play it differently right like the brazilians like the rhythm to their game
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:04.160]   versus the you know argentines are considered a little bit more uh traditionally more rigid among
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:08.960]   south americans as a culture more rigid and a little bit more aggressive as well more stiff upper lip
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:12.800]   absolutely yeah yeah absolutely they take them argentines take themselves very seriously i can
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:16.560]   say that as a half of argentine yeah we're taught to take ourselves seriously as people
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:21.120]   and um at the same time to enjoy life but to take ourselves seriously yeah i think there's a
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:27.280]   lesson in that too right brazil has been the most successful national soccer team of all time
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:32.000]   and you know like you just said you're not a soccer fan but you know how brazil plays soccer
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.400]   everyone knows how brazil plays soccer they dance and they play and it's just this thing you know
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:40.880]   it's a party it's a party yeah and that's how they play and everyone kind of knows how argentina
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:45.520]   plays as well you just said that you're not a soccer fan but you know that nobody knows how england
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:52.960]   plays england haven't won a world cup since 1966 they haven't won a major title since 1966 even
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:59.360]   though this is where the sport originated from everyone knows how germany plays and how germany has always
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:03.680]   played there's a way there's a german way of playing football there's a brazilian way of playing
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:07.680]   football there's an argentinian way of playing football there is no british way anymore
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:12.960]   so i think there's something in that right like if there's a connection where every single person
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:17.200]   that comes up from the age of four years old they know that the way in which everybody in this country
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:23.360]   plays oh okay i get that and we're all on the same team and all contributing to the same system in the
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:27.520]   same way where in the uk it's so disparate that no one understands it anymore
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:33.600]   i'm just soaking this in because my mind immediately goes to like like art
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:40.640]   one of my favorite movies is the movie basquiat by jump about john michelle basquiat not the documentary
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:46.240]   i mean the cast is like gary oldman david bowie i mean it's in dennis hopper christopher walk and it's
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:54.160]   just in an unbelievable cast um and the fact that basquiat was part haitian he was in you know new
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:59.120]   york in a time when new york was pretty gritty and like brought that together in his art it was like
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:04.320]   one part graffiti modern art and had this kind of tribal component that people made more of than they
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:10.480]   probably should have and and you could say the same thing about you know um andy warhol or about
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:15.840]   chuck close or you know when people are just being themselves but they're also taking their ancestry
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:20.320]   and they're taking their personal history which includes their ancestry and they're putting it into
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:28.160]   their art or their sport spectacular things happen so along those lines this is a somewhat controversial
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:32.320]   topic but i'm just gonna go right into it because i think everyone wonders about this
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:44.080]   i'll say this directly why are there fewer white strength and speed champion athletes in fact if you
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:49.920]   hang around track and field long enough you'll hear that's the third fastest white woman that's the
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:57.920]   second fastest white guy um people are using very specific language but we could put it differently
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:06.960]   get a lot of fast jamaicans um what's the deal is it um genetic contribution to fiber type
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:14.720]   um let's also talk about calf belly length which turns out to not be about calf belly length at all
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:19.520]   um what i'm saying there is people with quote unquote small calves tend to be fast runners
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:28.560]   what's the deal and i realize why this is a controversial topic but it's like so obvious because that
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:32.400]   it's almost silly to avoid at this point how can you not have the conversation yeah let's have a
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:38.480]   conversation about it it's it's it's obvious so what's the deal well as in all things when we're
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:45.600]   having discussions around topics like this it's both nature and nurture sure it's primarily in this case
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:52.400]   nature if you don't have the genetic capacity to run fast you won't run fast sorry you just don't you
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:57.120]   don't have enough type 2 fibers whatever it is proportion of type 2 it could be limb length it
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:03.360]   could be joint structure uh typically faster people have tighter smaller joints typically faster people
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.560]   have longer tendons and smaller muscle bellies typically faster people have more type 2x fibers
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:15.760]   typically faster people are slightly taller so all of these contributing genetic factors if you do not have
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:20.880]   those things and then that's not even talking about some of the hormonal factors some of the endocrinological
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:26.160]   factors some of the neural factors that we may not even understand yet there's all of these genetic
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:35.200]   determinants that play a part in what you are able to do so first and foremost we have to yes that is a fact
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:43.440]   that almost every single statistically almost every single human being that's ever ran sub 10 seconds
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:54.560]   is a black athlete from you know evolutionarily from maybe say west africa let me ask you uh sorry
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:03:00.240]   for interrupting but i think has a white person ever broken the 10 second mark in the 100 meters
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:06.160]   there's been a few so it was first uh christophe lemaitre i believe in either 2017 or 2018
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:14.160]   was the first white athlete to break 10 seconds and then there's been uh i feel like it's probably five
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:19.920]   maybe six asians now who have broken 10 seconds everybody else and that's
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:29.920]   close to 200 are are black and of course there's the nature component too which is if you come from a
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:38.400]   country where sprinting yes is a popular sport um or soccer is a popular sport or um you know distance
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:43.840]   running is a popular sport then there's gonna be a selection bias 100 yeah so we're taking those into that is
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:48.320]   that i would say that the gen if you don't have the genetics good luck you're not even in the room
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:52.640]   the genetics will get you in the room once you do in that room whether what that nature is what that
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:56.640]   upbringing is what that environment is that is going to determine what you know what you do with your
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:03.440]   genetics so for example a massive percentage and i don't know what this is but it's big a massive
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:10.640]   percentage of the athletes the male athletes who have ran sub 210 in a marathon come from the same little
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:17.920]   district in kenya like it's very very high percentage and part of that is not only their genetics but the
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:24.480]   environment which they're growing up in every single person that they know is a marathoner every single
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:31.120]   person they know are running in excess of 100 miles a week every single person they know uh you know this
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:36.720]   these are all of the things that that we need to do to be this right so they're seeing that from the
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:42.560]   day that they're born so for sure environment really matters what you do with that nature really really
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:46.800]   matters but if you don't have the genetic capacity to begin with you just as i said you don't have any
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:53.120]   chance at all and as you said like jamaica sprinting is massive in jamaica like it's really really important
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:58.720]   if i i would encourage you to do one thing go to champs at one point if you like track meets this
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:04.640]   is the best track meet in the world champs is the jamaican high school national championships and it's
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:12.880]   in kingston and it is incredible absolutely incredible the stands are packed so there's 45 50 000 people
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:20.320]   it's loud it's noisy it's boisterous and kids are just killing themselves trying to beat each other it's
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:25.200]   just an amazing event over the course of three or four days go to the last couple days of champs and
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:31.440]   just watch that and you just see ah i understand why jamaicans are so fast this is the environment
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:37.360]   in which many of them are operating within as they come up and this is like this is you know i i talked
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:41.440]   to uh so i'm a good friends with donovan bailey donovan bailey was a 1996 olympic champion he was
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:47.360]   a world record holder in 100 meters for a while he's of jamaican descent uh grew up in jamaica until he
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:52.480]   was 12. he moved to canada in 1981 which is the same year that i moved to canada so we've talked
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:59.280]   about this a lot and he said if you know if you do well at champs you're set you're going to do really
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:05.120]   well as a professional sprinter because there's nothing that has more pressure in it than actually
[02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:12.560]   competing well at jamaican high school national championships so understand what that environment
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:18.800]   does for the ability for your typical jamaican athlete to succeed at higher levels and all of
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:23.920]   those pockets you know pockets like this exist all over the world whether it's in in russia or whether
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:28.160]   it's in kenya whether it's in west africa or whether it's in you know right now we're seeing
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:33.280]   some interesting things in norway and some of the endurance sports right so it's for sure nurture is
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:37.520]   really really important genetics gets you in the room what you do in it within that room that's that's
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:41.760]   up to you and your environment that you create it's so interesting how these different cultures shape
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:51.200]   the the future of a sport or an endeavor in china kids are highly incentivized to learn a lot and test
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:56.720]   a lot in the math and sciences and they're really big on neuroscience in china i think these nature
[02:06:56.720 --> 02:07:02.320]   nurture questions are super interesting it sounds like jamaica is still churning out a lot of excellent
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:10.080]   sprinters because of the huge numbers that are fed fed to the sport and and can be you know essentially
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:15.040]   grow up their nervous systems are shaped around sprinting yeah couple that with any number of
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:20.400]   different um features and we were talking about you talk about short calf bellies right this is the um
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:29.120]   this is the fear of every uh uh bodybuilder right they they want long calf bellies but short calf bellies
[02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:34.560]   make people faster and better jumpers not because the calf is short but because because the tendon is long
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:39.680]   okay essentially we've got you know each muscle is really a muscle tendon unit
[02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:45.760]   and if you've got a longer tendon relative to your muscle effectively you're a little bit more
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:49.920]   plyometric you can store and release energy a little bit more effectively than somebody who has a shorter
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:56.320]   tendon and a longer or bigger fatter thicker muscle so we want really if you want to be fast you want
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:05.680]   long skinny tendons and small little muscle bellies so you know so what uh serves aesthetics sometimes
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:10.560]   doesn't necessarily serve the sport and and vice versa so if you had to pick one you'd want to be able to
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:16.720]   jump and run faster would you sure i mean i don't i don't i'm not yeah i mean i suppose that having
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:23.040]   very short calves would be weird but who wouldn't want to run faster or jump higher you know uh for all
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:27.920]   sorts of reasons just be so much fun yeah absolutely yeah i i don't have a lot of hops but um
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:36.640]   this is actually a time to talk about knees over toes guy ben patrick yeah he um uh fought a lot
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:43.200]   of adversity to like encourage people um including a lot of exercise physiologists and the people who do
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:48.800]   rehab from various um aspects that you know putting your knees out over your toes is okay
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:55.840]   um caught a lot of heat but i think the fact that he's so skilled at jumping and dunking and backbent
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:59.520]   and landing and backbends and things that sort puts them all to shame frankly i think most people
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:04.880]   understand now that ben is really on to something with this um one of the things that he's a big
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:12.480]   proponent of is um a lot of eccentric loading um but also not being afraid to get that knee way out
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:19.200]   over the toe what what is the deal with uh running form as it were is the idea that if you can get
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:26.800]   your knee higher you can stride further and then when we talk about um knee back toward butt how far
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:32.480]   back are we supposed to like kick our own glutes when we when we stride i mean what is a proper running
[02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:38.480]   stride or is it going to vary by by structure well that's uh that's a big question yeah like like explain
[02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:42.320]   that in five seconds i'm just kidding but you know for those of us who want to run a bit
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:48.240]   faster do some some um stride work yeah should i be reaching with my front leg and pulling myself
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:53.040]   forward on the ground 100 percent not please do not do that right and i shouldn't be just quickening
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:59.920]   my uh my turnover of a jogging stride so that's part of it yeah first of all let's start at the start
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:06.080]   and understand the way you move is going to be governed by the things that you are moving
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:11.440]   so how you move is governed by the stuff that you've got so you cannot move in a way in which
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:17.200]   your body will not allow so if you have a certain structure of your joints or a certain mobility
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:23.520]   structure or senate or a certain genetic makeup or a certain stiffness or a certain muscle fiber type
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:31.440]   all of those things come together together they all coalesce to sort of govern your motor strategy
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:39.440]   so the lat the last thing that i would want you to do andrew is to copy usain bolt's sprinting stride
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:45.920]   because usain bolt is six foot five 215 pounds he's a little bit more dynamic than you
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:52.080]   he's probably got slightly longer achilles tendons than you he's probably got tighter smaller joints
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:57.520]   than you he's probably a lot more elastic than you are he's probably a little bit more coordinated than
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:05.200]   you are so why would i want you to try to copy that so my job first and foremost is to understand how you
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:11.600]   should or how you could move based upon the constraints that you have based upon what are known as your
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:17.200]   action capabilities so your force capacity your mobility capacity all of these things that make
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:22.400]   up who you are your height your weight your joint length your joint ratios all of these different
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:28.000]   things your your limb limb ratios so first it's understanding that we are governed by the stuff that
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:34.880]   we have so it's we should never be trying to copy someone else first and foremost number two
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:44.240]   is then we should have some sort of understanding of what is the common way to do a thing and we can
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:51.680]   probably simplify this we kind of know a little bit about how we what a model looks like for a back
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:58.080]   squat or for a deadlift or for you choose your exercise we kind of have a model for that whether
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:03.600]   that's a mathematical model or whether that model was based upon the average of a bunch of elite movers
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:11.040]   we kind of okay we can understand what quote unquote optimal is mathematically but we also have to
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:18.640]   understand that we are not math we are biological beings that will all move in slightly varying ways
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:24.000]   depending upon the stuff that we are moving so yes we look at that model but we also look at what we've
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:31.680]   got and we try to find somewhere in the middle that serves us so in sprinting and in probably in most
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:39.120]   most activities we try to identify like what are the non-negotiables what are the rules here like in
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:43.520]   squatting we know what the rules are right we don't want to bend to one side we don't want to overly flex
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:49.840]   our our spine we don't want to anteriorly rotate our shoulders we don't want to have knee valgus where our
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:55.280]   knees come in and touch each other we don't want to have super wide feet we don't want to have internally
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:13:00.640]   rotated feet when we're when we're squatting all of these things that we know that we don't do they
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:05.440]   govern the things that we can do so in sprinting we have something similar we don't know as much about
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:13.040]   sprinting as we do in some of the more uh or maybe the less complex movements more discrete movements
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:18.960]   like a squat like a deadlift like a power clean the sprinting is coordinative it continues it's rhythmic
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:24.240]   so it's a little bit harder for us to actually study but we do know that as you said uh one of the
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:31.040]   things you said was high knees and most of the elite sprinters converge upon similar positions when
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:36.880]   their knee is super high and that knee gets up to about waist height like just almost belly button height
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:41.280]   when they're running as fast as they can so we know if we want to be fast we've got to kind of try and
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:45.680]   bring our knees up and we talked about that before too right the difference between striding and
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:50.080]   sprinting and sprinting and jogging and running where jogging and running happens behind the center
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:54.880]   mass and striding and sprinting is in front of the center mass so maybe first and foremost we think
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:59.360]   about bringing the knee up knees got to be a little bit higher you have to think about being in front
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:09.520]   we know that for sure every elite sprinter sets up a very stiff spring on the ground by being very very
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:16.640]   strong and stiff and rigid through the foot ankle complex so you have to be stiff on impact so think
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:23.760]   about the analogy that i give all the time is if you think about you're a boxer or you're boxing and
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:28.240]   you're hitting a heavy bag what would you do with your wrists and your fist you'd squeeze it and hold it
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:33.680]   rigidly because if you didn't it would really hurt and if you're trying to hit it as hard as you can you
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:39.360]   want it to be you have to be squeezed it's the same thing with sprinting because the forces by the way
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:45.200]   are pretty similar an elite boxer hits a heavy bag and somewhere in excess of five times their body
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:51.280]   weight in less than three hundredths of a second it's exactly the same as sprinting and elite sprinting
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:55.680]   is in excess of five times their body weight in less than three hundredths of a second time to peak
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:15:02.080]   force on ground ground contact so knees are up and we're very stiff on the ground and the third thing
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:10.640]   is if you do not have an effective hip extension pattern you just can't move well never mind run
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:18.480]   fast you have to have the the ability for your knee to come behind your butt now that's a hard thing to
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:24.240]   define it's a hard thing to quantify people ask me all the time like what do you mean like what is a good
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:29.920]   pattern if i talk about the hip extension pattern and the importance of that it's not just range of
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:35.440]   motion so that's the one that you alluded to is you know how far behind well the further the knee gets
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:39.520]   behind the center mass the more the range of motion it's not just that because in sprinting when you're
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:46.160]   upright especially you want to almost limit the amount of time that the knee travels behind the butt
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:51.120]   because the longer that the knee travels behind the butt the longer you're on the ground the slower you
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:59.120]   are so range of motion for you or for me or for rob or for anyone listening for running is going to be
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:07.280]   very different from a noah lyles or an andre degrasse or usain bald but this the qualitative aspect
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:12.800]   of all of those things is still really important and the way in which i judge the quality of a pattern
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:18.480]   is kind of five five fold do you have the force capacity to be able to extend your hip are you strong
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:23.280]   enough can you actually get your knee behind the hip and many people just can't do that because
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:28.400]   they're not strong enough do you have the velocity capacity can you actually move your limb fast enough
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:34.000]   to get it behind do you have the range of motion and most team sport athletes you know if i'm going in
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.040]   and talking to to coaches who work in team sports that's the big that's the low-hanging fruit that they
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:44.800]   just don't have the range so number three is the range number four is the control and if you're a kid if
[02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:49.920]   you're a 14 year old you probably don't have the control of that pattern and five is can you do it
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:55.040]   over and over again can you actually repeat it so when we're looking at the judging of a pattern
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:17:02.000]   it's force velocity uh repeatability control and range of motion is those those five things so that's
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:08.800]   you know that's a long answer to what i could talk about for for literally days is what are the things
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:13.440]   that we're looking at for sprinting the ability to get the thigh out high the ability to contact the
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:18.640]   ground really aggressively and the the ability to get the thigh or the knee behind the hip
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:27.280]   with high quality what are your thoughts on skipping rope yeah i think the ability to coordinate flexion
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:32.080]   extension at the ankle knee and hip is really important so you're coordinating the movement pattern
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:37.520]   both the or at the ankle at the knee and the hip and coordinating all of those in space and time
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:41.360]   and the ability to do that as we've talked about is one of the things that we lose as we age
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:47.840]   so skipping is one of those things that can quite simply work on that coordinate of aspect what i see
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:52.720]   too often though is people skipping incorrectly and skipping only through their ankles and not really
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:56.480]   doing a lot through the knees and the hip and they just sort of plantar flex or dorsiflex plantar flex
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:01.280]   dorsiflex so they just push up on their toes and they come off where we need to understand that plantar
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:09.120]   flexion or going up onto your toes is in dynamic movements a reflexive movement it's not a volitional
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:13.600]   movement it's not a movement that we should be thinking about or trying to control all we should be
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:19.200]   thinking about is just bouncing as if we're bouncing on a trampoline just bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:25.680]   bounce bounce and actually keeping our foot as stiff as we can just like skipping for me i just
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:30.720]   equate it to hitting a heavy bag over and over and over again pop pop pop pop pop pop you can't do
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:35.840]   that if you're on your toes you want to be on the balls of your feet like right on the base of your
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:41.520]   of your toes like and just then it's a lot easier to just bounce think about it bouncing so i think it's a
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:49.200]   great activity from that perspective is sort of just teaching how to coordinate the the uh what's called
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:54.880]   the amortization of all of the joints of the lower body and then as far as how to do it what to do
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:58.800]   it i just feel just do it yeah you know what i mean like just do it with heavy ropes do it do the
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:03.760]   light ropes have fun with it i think there's there's probably too many times that we're constrained by
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:10.080]   what people like me say to do what is right just have fun man just just just you know find a way in
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:15.120]   which to express yourself and enjoy the movement if you love jumping rope or hopping rope go do that
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:22.000]   just make sure that you try to understand what doing it well looks like or feels like so you can do it well
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:29.440]   i like to put on an album and skip for the album and then somehow just let the the music when i feel
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:34.480]   moved to skip different faster or high knees or something like that dictate yeah because then there's
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:39.680]   like this external coach slash rhythm it's something i like i'm not thinking about too much
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:45.840]   and then next thing i know i've got you know 35 minutes of quote-unquote cardio done um with a
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:49.920]   piece of plastic i don't know something very satisfying about doing that i don't know why
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:54.960]   um no i love it it's a yeah i i as you can probably tell i'm getting more and more interested in things
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:20:04.880]   that um drawn more aspects of the nervous system mind and body for exercise because i i while i love
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:10.880]   the gym i think it's it can be too linear and too rigid yeah and i think it leads to rigidity in one's
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:15.200]   thinking yeah um and that might come as a surprise to a lot of people think oh you know it's all you
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:21.040]   know all these protocols have to be done you know there's a fundamentally correct way to do most things
[02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:25.840]   like get morning sunlight in your eyes but if it's five minutes or seven minutes it depends on how bright
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:36.240]   it is and that what time of year i mean you know i feel like the biology is flexible yeah um and learning to go by
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:41.120]   feel can be very very helpful yeah i think we lose that too right we got to remember you know principles
[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:44.720]   are few and methods are many there's many ways to do different things as long as they align with
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:49.200]   the principles just think about what the principles are and then just be creative in choosing the methods
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:56.320]   that work for you yeah this is where peer-reviewed science unfortunately can't measure every variable
[02:20:56.320 --> 02:21:01.200]   yeah you know people say well like what have there been a study comparing you know 5 10 15 20
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:06.880]   minutes or 30 minutes of morning sunlight no yeah because you're lucky if you get 100 subjects
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:11.440]   you got to pay those subjects you got to get them to come in you're tracking sleep you're you use 10 000
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:16.720]   lux in one group and you know you know control light in another i mean you just don't have the option to
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:25.360]   work through every variable in anything even a dose response study of a drug you can't account for nutrition
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:30.560]   and the drug and then people go well then how can we trust any of this as a you know standard science
[02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:36.800]   as it were a reduction of science is just one lens through these things yeah that doesn't mean that
[02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:42.480]   people's experience is necessarily smarter than data it just means that data have to mesh with experience
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:48.960]   and and experience with data yeah i think data data can inform the decisions we make but they are not the
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:54.960]   decisions that we make you know we use that data but what's you know it's it's um what's most important
[02:21:54.960 --> 02:22:01.680]   is how all of these data points all this information comes together you know it's the it's the relationships
[02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:05.840]   and the interactions between the component parts which is more important than the individual component
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:11.440]   parts themselves so we have to understand what those relationships are that's the thing we need to focus a
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:17.760]   little bit more on i'd like to talk about weight training what do sprinters do for their weight training
[02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:24.240]   and if somebody like me is interested in becoming a faster runner doing maybe even sprinting someday
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:31.040]   besides just doing skips and strides what are some ways of doing exercises in the gym that can
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:36.960]   potentially facilitate our ability to move better outside of the gym first let's look at the kinetics
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:43.520]   of sprinting sprinting is only really truly about four things how much force you apply in the ground
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:50.560]   how fast can you apply it the direction in which you apply it and how heavy you are and it's just those four things
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:58.480]   four things how much force how fast which direction what is your mass so we need to yeah force is
[02:22:58.480 --> 02:23:03.760]   important we have to be able to apply a certain level of force but there's a threshold to this everyone
[02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:10.000]   says there's a big question and has been for a long time how much strength quote unquote is enough in
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:16.960]   sprinting well enough is it's the same question that we ask we should ask in every task there's a rate of
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:23.920]   diminishing returns on all of these capacities that we need that we require is spending an extra few
[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:32.400]   years trying to get an extra five kilos to your power clean or an extra 25 pounds to your back squat as
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:38.400]   effective as a means to get faster than it would be if you say you start skipping maybe do some more
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:44.320]   explosive work actually start sprinting a little bit more so there's always this um from a programming
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:50.080]   perspective is understanding where the athlete is what they require what they've got where they are in
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:54.880]   the rate of diminishing returns on each of those capacities so first we have to understand that um
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:24:01.200]   let me zoom out just a little bit i coach andre andre degrasse as we talked about andre when i started
[02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:07.280]   coaching him in 2015 could barely squat his body weight eight months later he's three-time olympic
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:15.280]   medalist eight months later he was one and a half years into his sprinting career he'd sprinted for 18
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:22.160]   months he had three olympic medals in the sprints the 100 the 200 and the four by one he could barely squat
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:30.880]   his body weight he could clean 60 kilos so 135 pounds he definitely couldn't bench a plate and a half
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:39.040]   he might have had 145 pound plate uh bench yeah maybe super weak but on the other end of the spectrum
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:46.640]   this is the example that everyone gives you've got ben johnson famously ben johnson did this 600
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:55.360]   pound squat a couple of days prior to winning in the tokyo olympics in 1988 running 979 obviously that
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:25:01.040]   was thereafter taken away after he tested positive so you've gone on one end of the spectrum somebody
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:08.240]   like ben johnson who applies incredibly incredible amounts of force and on the other end you've got
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:14.640]   somebody like andre degrasse who doesn't apply relatively any force but does it really really fast
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:21.600]   so this gives you like an understanding of the spectrum of capacities and abilities that humans
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:29.760]   have to do a task in an almost infinite number of ways so to get to your question it depends on who you
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:35.600]   are and what you're good at and why you're good at it there's not one way when you've got a ben johnson
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:39.680]   who can apply incredible amounts of forces and that's one of the reasons why he's fast on the other end
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:44.960]   of the spectrum you've got andre degrasse who's weaker than most high school girls who's incredible fat
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:49.920]   incredibly fast where does that leave us that just tells us okay there's many different ways to do
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:56.160]   this which is great it's cool that gives us again some freedom to better ask the questions about what
[02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:02.000]   it is that makes you andrew really good like you apply a lot of force okay let's lean into that let's
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:08.960]   try to improve your speed by try to maximize your force but what are you limited by okay you're having
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:13.920]   trouble getting off the ground you're not super reactive or reflexive so we have to work some
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:19.280]   things into your program that's going to make you a little bit more reactive or reflexive so maybe we'll
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:24.640]   do some jump squats maybe we'll do some hurdle hops maybe we'll do some more skipping maybe maybe we feel
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:30.160]   like okay you've reached the rate of diminishing returns on your force capacity you don't need to squat
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:37.840]   four plates if you squat 385. is going from 385 to 405 going to make you any faster no not at all so
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:43.360]   let's keep you at 385 and we'll just do some other things so first and foremost it's respecting the
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:50.400]   individuality of all things and understanding that there's not one way in which i can tell you do this
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:56.720]   because this is what he did and that's what's going to work for you now there is as i said before there's
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:04.800]   non-negotiables and there's rules to things so sprinting is how you transmit that force into the
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:11.440]   track in a really fast period of time in the right direction so the transmission of force is typically
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:19.600]   more important than the magnitude of the force at least at the elite end at least at the adult end
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:26.320]   so transmission of force means how the the amount of force that you put into the ground how do you
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:31.760]   use it to propel yourself forward so what are the types of exercises that maybe what would you think
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:38.480]   about if i said this is a force transmission exercise rather than say a force magnitude exercise
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:46.400]   is that something that appeals to you yeah jump squat comes to mind you know um jump squat comes to mind
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:53.840]   any kind of uh like push clap push-ups yeah um you know the ability to like
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:28:00.960]   yep double clap or you know or more um yes that's what comes to mind i think that's pretty accurate
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:05.040]   olympic lifts is one is one that where a lot of people would say yes olympic lift that's kind of what
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:09.920]   we're doing with like a clean you're kind of yeah i'm not i don't do olympic lifts but from what i
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:14.800]   understand i you know that they're they're pushing off the ground to get get the bar up yeah it's it's
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:23.760]   essentially can we apply high forces fast over a long period of time so that's kind of we do we
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:28.720]   spend a lot of time looking at those types of exercises sled work uh we don't do any sled work
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:34.320]   we could get back to that if you know sled work for elite sprinters we don't we do resisted acceleration
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:41.040]   work so we'll sprint we'll do some specific strength work where we're pulling uh you know
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:47.280]   probably in excess of 10 to 15 kilos you know so 20 to 30 pounds ish do you use the parachute that
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:51.600]   was a big thing a few years back remember that yeah like the parachute i used the parachute 20 years ago
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:56.320]   absolutely we don't know we we uh we actually have a we have a piece of equipment called the power
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:29:01.600]   cord we use that i use yes that's really good spring-loaded and the 1080 sprint which is this
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:06.320]   incredible piece of equipment that we use that we can really dial in the resistance down to like
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:11.920]   you know a half a kilo that's it's beautiful so we use that but that's for different reasons so the you
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:17.760]   talked about the weight room in in the in the um the population of athletes i work with
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:25.440]   maximum strength is at the rate of diminishing returns already we don't spend almost any time
[02:29:25.440 --> 02:29:31.360]   working on that at a lower level of population maybe if you're high school kid or if you're in
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:37.280]   your 20s when you're not super or if you're super weak just by increasing your force capacity so your
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:43.520]   ability to apply force you will get faster because remember what the calculation is amount of force
[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:50.640]   how fast direction and body mass so it is important it just becomes less and less and less important
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:57.280]   the faster you get so it's and then it becomes when it's less important when the ability to produce a
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:02.160]   high magnitude of force isn't important what is important so then we're starting looking at plyometric
[02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:10.240]   things and probably most specifically i'm looking at specific isometric stuff in the weight room so let's
[02:30:10.240 --> 02:30:17.120]   look at the position in which we're applying in excess of five times our body weight and that's
[02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:23.760]   when the foot is directly underneath the center mass the foot is flat on the ground there's about a 15
[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:32.240]   degree knee bend and there's about a 5 to 10 degree hip bend so can you think of think about that position
[02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:37.840]   so we're pushing up against an immovable bar or holding a very very heavy bar on one leg
[02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:45.680]   with as heavy as we can or as hard as we can for somewhere between three to five seconds times
[02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:51.440]   three to four repetitions and we'll do like three sets of that that's alex notero's work he's one of the
[02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:57.280]   the premier researchers in what's called run specific isometric strength training so it's getting strong
[02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:05.040]   in really specific positions to the task that you're trying to be come better at so that's that's the
[02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:09.680]   primary one for me is that position where the foot is directly underneath the center mass there's a
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:14.080]   little bit of a knee bend there's a little bit of a hip bend and we do a lot of isometric work right
[02:31:14.080 --> 02:31:23.600]   there that's that's and then i and this is my bias i do nothing bilateral at all you mean parallel stance
[02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:32.560]   parallel stance nothing except occasionally if it is an issue you know with neural drive or whatever i'll do some
[02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:37.920]   uh trap bar deadlifts so some parallel stance trap bar deadlifts because i think it's a great exercise
[02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:43.520]   i think that's difficult to do with a staggered stance it's very difficult to do with a a single
[02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:49.840]   leg stance but you can load up some pretty good weight on a parallel stance trap bar deadlift and
[02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:56.480]   yeah i feel pretty good and you get a good feeling out of that it's not necessarily to be um be able to
[02:31:56.480 --> 02:32:02.320]   apply or generate more force it's more about sort of neural drive than it is for anything else everything
[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:07.760]   every single other thing that we do is in a staggered stance heel to toe or kickstand which is kind of the
[02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:13.600]   same same sort of thing just a different terminology or split stance or a stance where the front foot is
[02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:19.760]   elevated or the rear foot is elevated so we'll do as as we as we've talked about quite a bit now find
[02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:25.440]   opportunities to get the knee behind the butt that's a really important position can we get stronger
[02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:30.880]   faster more control more repeatability and more range at that position one of the things i learned from you
[02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:37.520]   yesterday is um well let's i'll double click first on this um the staggered stance so this is one foot
[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:42.560]   slightly in front of the other um i've been doing this with various lifts in the gym for a long time
[02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:47.600]   i would say the exception would be if i'm belt squatting or hack squatting i don't do that
[02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:54.480]   but for everything else overhead presses um anything where my feet are in contact with the ground that is
[02:32:54.480 --> 02:33:00.400]   uh not on pull-ups and dips of course but um curls tricep extensions and i make sure to vary
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:04.480]   the stance so one foot is in front for one set one is in front for the other sometimes even in the
[02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:11.360]   middle of the set i'll i'll switch them up after um and i found that to be tremendously helpful for
[02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:16.400]   building core stability and a number of other things uh and it sounds like it might help running
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:21.440]   gate as well the other thing that you said yesterday that i think is really important i've not thought of
[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:27.120]   before but now i'm doing is anytime you have a a foot elevated in the gym to get onto the toe front
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:33.200]   foot can be flat yeah i think the ability to get off your first ray so for the big toe to bend and flex
[02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:39.440]   is really important so for me if i if that's important i'm going to search for opportunities
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:46.000]   to do that as often as i can so if i have an option to either flex the big toe or not then we're going
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:51.600]   to flex the big toe now if you can't and many athletes cannot you know there's a lot of athletes
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:56.320]   that just cannot extend to that big toe or some athletes have bunions and just can't get over it
[02:33:56.320 --> 02:34:00.080]   and that's okay we can go on to the top of the foot which is not the not the end of the world
[02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:04.240]   but i look for opportunities like that like i look for opportunities to extend the hip
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:11.680]   how can i work hip extension exercises into everything i do how do i look at or do i look for
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:20.720]   full full chain or full body force transmission exercises as much as i possibly can ideally from
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:25.360]   the left foot to the right hand and the right foot to the left hand so cross body so i'm looking for these
[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:32.480]   long fascial chains so like ways in which i can bring some function to the work that i'm doing in
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:37.280]   the weight room some level of transferability between the things that i do in the weight room and the
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:41.840]   things that we do on the track because frankly most of the things that we do in the weight room don't
[02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:46.720]   transfer to the track a squat doesn't really transfer it's a totally different exercise performed a
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:52.080]   totally different way at a totally different time totally different weights so the transference is
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:58.560]   very very far it's very it's not very nebulous so i'm looking for ways in which we can find a way to
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:04.720]   transfer the capacities that we are building in the weight room directly to the track and with respect to
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:08.320]   stretching i'm thinking again of yoga because this is where the probably the first time i've done this
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:17.040]   where one would lunge so front foot planted flat rear foot up on the big toe if possible the knee back
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:24.080]   of that rear foot um or rear leg excuse me back behind the butt and then the opposite arm raised above
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:31.760]   that's that fascial um sling that cuts across from and you know in anatomy nomenclature contralateral
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:39.920]   across the midline um and then essentially trying to learn to feel that um line that goes all the way
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:45.600]   from one's big toe that's planting back across up the leg across the the pelvis up the body and shoulder
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:53.520]   to the opposite tips of finger 100 and it's it's if uh if i can add to that stretch um this is something
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:36:01.600]   that i really love kelly about you know he's he's so much on i need you to be in control of your body
[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:07.040]   there is a way to do this but then it's up to you to find out a better way for you specifically so
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:11.600]   you've done a great job of outlining what the stretch looks like now what can i do with my body
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:17.760]   to actually make this better do i rotate to one side do i side bend to one side do i flex the hand
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:23.600]   as well as as well as doing this so because this will be a better stretch than that so palm parallel to
[02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:29.600]   the to the ceiling 100 of the raised hand correct if i push the knee back and try to push the heel
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:35.440]   on the ground and actually contract if i rotate my pelvis underneath me posteriorly like you know
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:41.600]   do a a pelvic tilt underneath me well will that increase it so it's always this explore exploratory
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:47.280]   process there is a right way to do things but you are an individual we're all unique snowflakes right
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:54.080]   we're all moving different ways and it's up to us to explore all of our uniqueness distant topic from
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:37:00.400]   the one that we're on but one that i and i think a number of people are curious about is drugs in
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:10.880]   sports um performance enhancing drugs there's a new um potentially new sports league track league
[02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:17.120]   which is the enhanced games who knows if that will go through um but right now using performance
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:25.200]   enhancing drugs most performance enhancing drugs is banned in track but because of the ben johnson thing
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:30.400]   that was 88 olympics where he was like jaundiced at the eyes and you know it turned out he was taking
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:37.280]   winstraw and he was stripped of his metal um and then the discussion is they're all using it some just
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:44.480]   get caught this kind of thing or they're using in the off season how common is um people usually say
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:50.240]   steroid use but androgen enhancement right because performance enhancing drugs could be drugs to lower
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:55.200]   the heart rate for the biathletes they do that too right keep your heart rate lower you know there's all
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:38:01.840]   sorts of drugs that are banned that are not androgen increasing but yeah but things like um
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:10.720]   testosterone derivatives yeah in the men and women how common is it yeah um uh now not common at all
[02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:19.920]   in fact i don't know of any elite sprinter that i could um definitely point to say that person is dirty
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:28.160]   none it was common 60s and 70s extremely common 80s very very common 90s when testing started
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:35.600]   becoming a bit better much less common 2000s 2010s and 20s i just don't know how much of it is getting
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:42.320]   done now or being done across the board there are pockets so we obviously know about russia and what's
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:46.320]   going on with the eastern block and all of the drugs that they've taken that's been state sponsored
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:52.560]   all of that is out there we know that for sure if you were an elite russian athlete almost certainly
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:57.920]   you were taking drugs you didn't have a choice you didn't have a choice no one really knows now
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:01.600]   because russia has been banned from all sports so you don't see russian athletes almost anywhere
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:07.440]   um i think there's a few few sports that you do but most of them now you don't see russian athletes
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:12.480]   but it's so hard like that's a part of the culture and has been part of the culture for
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:18.000]   you know since the 50s that's what we do because everyone else is cheating so this is what we do so
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:26.000]   it's a state-sponsored system and i feel like there's you know there's 150 or 160 something like
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:32.720]   that positive drug cases come out of kenya over the course of the last decade so you think okay there's
[02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:37.520]   something going on with in with kenyans is that distance running distance running and there i should
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:43.360]   say because some people might not be uh familiar with this um with distance running or cycling
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:49.360]   triathlon it's probably not increasing androgens like testosterone dihydrotestosterone etc it's
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:55.920]   probably um things that increase red blood cell count right ability to deliver more oxygen and fuel
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:01.760]   sources to the cells this kind of blood uh epo these and things like that yeah but but and and this one in
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:07.680]   kenya like i understand it i understand the russian thing as well like if you're a kenyan kid you're 18
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:13.040]   years old you've got some talent an agent comes to you and says i'm going to give you fifty thousand
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:18.400]   dollars and i'm going to support you for the first two years of your career and this is what everyone
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:24.000]   does anyway and you know we'll take the risk a little bit but we can you know you can actually make
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:30.320]   something of yourself become a star get a house feed your family do this do that that's a hard
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:36.560]   calculation for a kid to make as it was in the steroid era in baseball it's almost logical to take
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:42.160]   drugs at that point right these guys aren't testing me at all so why wouldn't i why wouldn't barry bonds
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:49.280]   take drugs now that's a different calculation for most of the rest of the world where there isn't these
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:56.640]   practices going on in kenya with a lot of a lot of shady people to be honest with you and and i honestly
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:41:01.760]   i do not see drugs at all in the sport anymore there will be pockets of people like for sure there will
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:06.080]   be some dirt there'll be a few dirty coaches there'll be a few dirty managers there'll be a few people
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:13.120]   doing some dirty things but i'm very very confident that the top people in all of the events are doing
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:19.840]   it clean very confident it's great to hear it and i i would not know the first like i've been in the
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:25.840]   sport for a long time i would know what to do what to take who to get it from so when i look at you know
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:29.920]   i look at uh you know choose your athlete i won't name any names and you look at their who they're
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:35.360]   surrounded by i know those people well how would they do it i had no idea like no one really knows
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:42.240]   right because i mean the drug testing is pretty stringent now it's really it's hard it's really really
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:48.880]   hard that's um encouraging to hear um especially for young people who are watching olympics and you
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:54.320]   know it's a terrible thing that if they were to think oh you know they're all they're all using um
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:42:00.800]   and i think one good trend in the last few years is there's a lot more openness now in the kind of
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:05.280]   fitness world because when i was growing up of course those like veiny bodybuilder people were
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:10.480]   they were all juiced to the gills and they'd say they weren't but they absolutely were and nowadays you
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:16.960]   know if people are doing trt or something they say it right you know i've talked about it microdose every
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:22.960]   other day since i was 45 never before then but i've relied on other things to keep testosterone in
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:28.320]   range and i take hcg maintain fertility that's all checked out but i'm very clear about exactly how
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:33.040]   much the internet has it wrong it's 25 milligrams every other day by the way i'm staggered with 600
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:38.000]   i use of hcg every other day i said that early on because i was like i'm not a competitive athlete i got
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:43.920]   nothing to hide right and i'll say that was it trt i'll say not really because my testosterone was in
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:48.880]   mid-sevens but i was getting fatigued a lot and bumping it up a little bit higher which is what this
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:56.640]   has done has been great for me but it's the people that lie like the liverking situation where he looked at
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:02.480]   the camera unfortunately and filmed himself saying i i that he doesn't and then he gets caught it's like
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:08.400]   blah and then you've got people that are juicing really hard and um and it's tricky in sports
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:14.160]   because or in movies right like when an actor suddenly is like big and shredded and you're just
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:19.040]   like oh you know the telltale signs it's probably not testosterone it's probably oxandrolone or something
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:23.360]   a little bit quote-unquote lighter but there's not nothing light about oxandrolone on your liver or
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:29.280]   your hairline folks so um but this is a bigger discussion but i think it's important to just be
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:37.440]   open about it yeah you know because um we want to see people run faster than ever before we want to see
[02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:41.760]   people jump higher than ever before we want to see people run marathons faster than ever before
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:49.520]   and it sucks when we find out that they were enhanced and that was breaking the rules what what
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:56.400]   sucks more is the reputational damage that those things do for the people who are actually doing
[02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:01.680]   this well and clean right the 99.9 percent of the people who are trying to do this the right way
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:06.720]   that are being colored with the same brush right and that's what really frustrates me it was really
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:14.080]   frustrated i've coached one athlete in my career who tested positive 2001 olympic trials and bobsled his
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:20.080]   name was pavly jovanovic he was um at the time the best bobsledder on the planet
[02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:36.080]   so tested positive for nandrolone so deca duravolone um later it was shown that it came from his
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:44.640]   supplement so if you remember this was 2001. oh yeah you could you could buy ghb late 90s at gnc at
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:52.240]   that time correct late 90s up until the the early 2000s there were supplement companies purposefully
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:58.560]   lacing their protein with steroids to try to sell more supplements goodness gracious and there's studies
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:04.400]   that showed this and they ended up there was a group of athletes that all tested positive that sued this one
[02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:10.640]   company that uh and you know the company ended up just you know declaring bankruptcy and nobody got a
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:17.280]   cent and long story short ruined his career ruined his reputation ended up taking his own life
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:23.360]   so i've seen and this is you know this is just people from the outside just look at that and say
[02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:29.760]   oh just another druggie bobsetter just another druggie football player just another druggie sprinter
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:36.960]   they're all on drugs and they're not they're not 99.9 of people trying to do this right like they're
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:42.160]   good people not making any money in this sport especially in track and field it's a different
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:49.120]   calculation as you said in hollywood or in the nfl or in baseball where the testing is significantly
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:53.440]   more relaxed than it is in track and field or significantly more relaxed than what it is in
[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:59.600]   almost all amateur sports amateur sports is almost impossible to be dirty these days it really is and
[02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:08.800]   if you just think about this trayvon bromell ran 997 as a high school kid he was five foot seven 135 pounds
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:14.880]   think that kid was taking drugs of course he wasn't so if you can run 997
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:25.120]   as a 17 year old at that age why can't you run nine seven six seven eight years later after actually
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:30.080]   training and being an elite program of course you can yusain bolt ran 1984 when he was 18 years old
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:37.840]   he ran sub 10 when he was 19 years old world class just a kid just a kid yeah like these these you know
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:43.600]   you're seeing high school kids now running ridiculously fast times in the mile as well in in every single
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:48.240]   event right every event across and they're not assisted this is one thing where i hear we're
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:52.560]   cutting between sport and we're talking about fitness and you know i the reason i mentioned the
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:47:00.560]   age when i started trt is that a um never never occurred to me didn't need it i felt like i got great
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:06.640]   results uh until then um and i think the biggest thing is recovery i think it helps i do think it helps
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:16.560]   you recover uh better no question actually um but a real shame nowadays is that because of instagram
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:21.600]   and people showing their bodies and this desire for people to get results more quickly a lot of guys
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:30.160]   in their teens 20s and 30s are taking testosterone when they don't need it it does shut down sperm
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:36.160]   production unless they're offsetting that with hcg or something like that and um they may think they
[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:40.720]   don't want kids now but they may want them later and some permanent damage can be done in addition
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:44.720]   to that i mean puberty is a very protracted thing for a lot of people it's not like oh yeah you know
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:49.680]   you start puberty at 14 it ends at 16 your brain's still developing so we we don't really understand how
[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:56.960]   all that works not this olympics but prior to that one there was a female athlete who tested positive for
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:03.360]   deca um the deca burrito she blamed it on a burrito meat and i remember hearing that and i sort of
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:12.480]   facetiously said and i'll say it again not facetiously like if she got caught for deca i hope she took deca
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:20.240]   because to knowingly take a banned substance and get caught and then banned from the sport is one thing
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:28.400]   but to inadvertently take a banned substance as did this bobsledder and then get banned from your sport
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:35.520]   that's a real tragedy for multiple reasons and that's what happened dreadful it is it's absolutely
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:40.480]   dreadful she just she just started competing again like last month rob and i were actually talking about
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:47.680]   this yesterday at the track she's she's made the world indoor team for us atf uh starting next week
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:52.960]   i think it definitely happens you know we we look at that and there's yeah they're blaming the burrito
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:59.600]   they're blaming meat or whatever but 100 why would you you run 5k why are you taking deca why are you
[02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:04.480]   taking natural it doesn't make sense no it makes zero sense you're not doing that yeah like that is from the
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:12.720]   meat well i get contacted a lot um probably not as much as other people do uh by athletes at different
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:18.560]   levels professional amateur etc asking about ways to improve testosterone etc i got great results all
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:25.760]   through my um mid-30s until mid-40s and and still with like tonga ali freeing some testosterone up my
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:30.400]   blood charts told me that worked for me may not work for everybody great fedogia things like that
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:36.720]   things like that subtle effects but meaningful subtle but meaningful um and then athletes will
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:41.360]   ask me well is it allowed i said you have to check with your organization you just can't take something
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:46.480]   you have to check with your organization the thing i am well aware of now is all the peptide use
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:52.640]   right peptides are really really big and they're in use in the general population more and more and
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:56.560]   it'll be interesting to see how those impact sport i'm not aware of any athletes at least none have come
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:03.040]   to me saying they take these peptides but um it's gonna be interesting to see how that shapes sport i
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:12.720]   think people over estimate how much these drugs contribute to success at the elite level yeah i i because
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:18.160]   i mean what you're talking about with these athletes you work with are just the you know hundreds and
[02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:26.400]   hundreds of hours of work to get a one percent improvement in some metric or point one percent
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:31.520]   point one percent it's just you know i think people really overestimate it sure if people just want to
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:38.720]   be big with a bunch of acne yeah you can do that big acne sterile like there you know that you can get
[02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:45.760]   that in the locker room most any gym nowadays um please don't do it um but to get you know half a second off
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:53.600]   your time it's no drugs drug is thousands of hours of work right it is sleeping really well it's eating
[02:50:53.600 --> 02:51:01.040]   really well it's having a good proper life you know it's there's no shortcut to that there really isn't
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:09.520]   you've got to get really really fast to be fast and this is even back in the drug era you didn't take
[02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:15.760]   drugs to be fast you got fast first and then you took drugs and that made you faster that's how
[02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:21.040]   people did it you don't take drugs to get fast you don't go from 10 2 to 10 flat or 10 3 to 10 flat or
[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:27.200]   10 2 to 9 8 it doesn't happen that way so it's now it's it's for me it's like the most important
[02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:33.440]   one for me is are you training well is it organized properly are you sleeping well are you eating well are
[02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:40.480]   you taking whatever the the good clean supplements that you can take and we take very very few by the
[02:51:40.480 --> 02:51:46.800]   way and do you have a good social life and then all of these things come together and interact in a way
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:53.200]   that feeds your purpose of running fast you know that's that's it honestly it says as i said with with
[02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:59.920]   andre i spoke i started working with andre in 2015. he could not squat his body weight basically you know
[02:52:00.960 --> 02:52:06.560]   three olympic medals 18 months after starting the sport it can be done which shows yeah okay this is
[02:52:06.560 --> 02:52:13.680]   being done that's awesome and it it points to the fact that more muscle isn't always the solution no
[02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:21.840]   the things that keep coming to mind are the ability to put away uh self-consciousness to use the body to
[02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:28.480]   express to find oneself yeah um and it's so interesting because i thought we were gonna sit down and talk about
[02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:37.200]   running yeah me too but i think these are much larger and if i may uh more important themes although
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:47.600]   people should definitely skip and stride and uh dupli metrics i'd be interested to hear your thoughts
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:53.360]   i asked you this question earlier like do you feel like there is a single metric that is a better
[02:52:53.360 --> 02:53:03.120]   determinant for overall health or vitality than the ability to maximally sprint now not be fast but to
[02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:10.400]   go out and actually sprint maximally think about all of the things that come along with the ride with
[02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:16.800]   that think about vo2 max like vo2 max in and of itself isn't important it's a proxy for all of these other
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:21.680]   things that are important the ability to sprint maximally isn't necessarily important but it's a
[02:53:21.680 --> 02:53:28.080]   proxy for everything else i can't think of anything else and you're talking to somebody who's now working
[02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:36.000]   on grip strength uh because i was challenged publicly by paul saladino um the carnivore md who now talks about
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:41.200]   animal diet and people are starting to take him more seriously by the way because at first it was all meat
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:47.120]   then it was meat and fruit there's meat fruit and some dairy yeah um i do this and i also eat
[02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:53.280]   vegetables the guy has salad in his name for god's sake uh he's a friend i'm friends with him i'm friends
[02:53:53.280 --> 02:53:57.200]   with lane i'm friends with the t i i get along with all those guys but some of them don't get along with
[02:53:57.200 --> 02:54:04.640]   each other i'll tell you that um but he challenged me to a grip strength contest which actually was not
[02:54:04.640 --> 02:54:12.560]   grip strength and he said this is the marker of longevity um and he hello bastard hung from a bar
[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:19.920]   switching hands yeah for 12 plus minutes yeah in the rain now he had someone toweling off the bar
[02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:26.800]   but that is a very impressive grip strength slash endurance score sure um as long as we're on this i
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:31.200]   mean this has become like kind of an online thing people want to um challenge each other with here are my
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:34.960]   biometrics you asked what are the markers of longevity brian johnson is big on these are my
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:39.600]   markers those have become controversial lately because it's unclear the markers were all collected
[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:47.280]   at the same date uh you know there's questions about uh for instance um it's weird that testosterone
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:52.320]   will be elevated but not showing lh means you're probably enhanced and if he is cool but people need
[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:57.280]   to be very open the nice thing about what paul showed is he showed the full length video right
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:04.640]   you have to show the full length video folks brian i'm calling you out specifically you can't post vo2
[02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:11.360]   max and not show the actual ride and the read off the off the the you have to show video people don't
[02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:17.600]   trust it anymore and so the point here is is grip strength is it vo2 max is it your testosterone
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:23.280]   relative to free testosterone it's all these things like you said if i were to step back and say is there a single
[02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:31.760]   physical metric i i think you got me i think that the ability to run fast without blowing a gasket
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:41.680]   or injuring yourself in some way um run fast for you it would be it and and i did not think about that
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:46.640]   or and i certainly wouldn't have said that at the beginning of uh this conversation so i think it's a
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:51.760]   very important insight and that's if nothing else should motivate everybody to get better at it great and
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:58.480]   they can check out the video that we did what you said earlier has become to me and will remain my goal
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:04.320]   i think that well-being physical well-being mental well-being is the ability to
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:13.040]   exert express pressure mentally and physically like sit down like you know to actually generate pressure
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:17.760]   around doing something hard that's you know takes an organization of mind and body it could be a physical
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:27.280]   pursuit and then to feel peace from the better expression of that cognitive or physical or creative
[02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:34.320]   endeavor i think this um this pressure peace thing is is more than non-trivial i think i think it's the
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:40.160]   essence of what i've been seeking my whole life the ability to exert pressure and to create things
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:47.440]   that are meaningful and then the ability to feel peace uh i think is um well it's it's yours you
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:52.880]   came up with it i'm just yeah but i was applying it to specifically a task a hundred meter sprint test
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:57.280]   and you've taken it and yeah that makes a lot of sense i love that because you got to sleep at night
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:03.920]   you gotta train hard 100 you gotta do your if you're me you know formal education and then you gotta also
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:09.200]   relax and have a good time and can you do them all at the same time that's the that's the key yeah can
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:13.520]   you structure your days in a way where the first two-thirds is just pure pressure and be okay with
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:17.600]   that because you know there's peace coming yeah because of some of the things that you pressured
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:24.480]   upon yourself love it well i love it and it's all it's all yours stu and um i have to say i it's been
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:29.520]   years i've been wanting to sit down and talk with you for a very long time we run into each other at track
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:35.200]   meets we do and um it's a real honor and pleasure you've taught us so much and there's much more so
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:40.560]   i hope you'll come back at some point and we'll um talk about other things as things evolve but talk
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:46.960]   about sprinting talk about sprinting and um i'll do a dangerous thing uh which is to say if folks want
[02:57:46.960 --> 02:57:53.200]   to go to a track meet i'll be at the track meets um and i'll probably be letting people know when i'll be
[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:59.440]   at track meets i go as a fan um i'm not looking for uh attention there i'm actually there to just
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:05.600]   enjoy the the incredible expression of the athletes both physical and emotional expression it's it's a
[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:09.680]   real it's a real beautiful thing it really is no i appreciate you i appreciate you showing up to those
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:16.960]   meets and talking about those meets it's important for our our uh possibly dying sport so it's uh it's
[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:22.160]   important that we get more people out to these meets and and support track and field the the foundation
[02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:29.360]   of human movement well you're a legend as everyone says in the sport and outside of it too thank you
