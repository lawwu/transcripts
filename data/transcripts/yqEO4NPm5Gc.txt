[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.600]   - Well, today we have a pair of solid Bible questions
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.880]   that at first don't seem to be related,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.580]   but they are united by Paul
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.080]   in Colossians chapter three, verses nine to 11.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.840]   So I'll lump them together in this episode.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.680]   The first one is from a listener named Aaron.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.240]   Pastor John, hello, in light of Colossians three,
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.920]   nine to 11, that we have put off the old self
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.600]   and put on the new self.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.480]   What role does ethnic identity now play
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.400]   in the Christian life?
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.680]   And why does Paul relate this identity
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.680]   to putting off the old self?
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.880]   And the second question on the same text
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.320]   is from a listener named Justin.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.600]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.720]   for considering my question.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.140]   Paul says in Colossians three, 11,
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.160]   that Christ is all and in all.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.240]   That seems very significant to me.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.640]   Can you explain it?
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.320]   - Yeah, it does sound significant
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.200]   because it is significant.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.880]   - And it is beautiful.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.880]   I mean, who wouldn't wanna know what that means for us?
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.280]   Christ is all and in all.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.920]   So let's read it in context.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.240]   Here's Colossians three,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.760]   starting in the middle of verse nine through 11.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.680]   You have put off the old self with its practices
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.760]   and have put on the new self,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.280]   which is being renewed in knowledge
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.440]   after the image of its creator.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.440]   Here, and the here there means here in this church
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.800]   and these relationships in this group of people
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.400]   who have put off the old and put on the new.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.780]   Here, there is not Greek and Jew,
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.720]   circumcised and uncircumcised,
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.760]   barbarian, Scythian, slave, free,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.760]   but Christ is all and in all.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   So Paul moves from individual newness in verse 10
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.360]   to corporate or church or relational newness in verse 11.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.440]   And it's crucial to see that movement.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.640]   A lot of people would like to deny
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.680]   that it moves that direction, but it doesn't.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.040]   It moves from individual to corporate.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.400]   Verse 10, you have put off the old self,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.000]   very individual, with its practices
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.160]   and have put on the new self,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.960]   which is being renewed in knowledge
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.040]   after the image of its creator.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.760]   Now, in order to understand what he's going to say
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.280]   about the newness of the new relationships,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.680]   we have to get at the essence
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.320]   of what the newness of the new self is.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.080]   The church is made up of people whose old self has died
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.260]   and whose new self has been created in the image of Christ.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.260]   God in Christ has brought a new creation
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.040]   into being our new self.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.000]   So what then is the central mark of the old self that died
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.020]   and the new self that lives?
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.040]   This is gonna shape all our relationships.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.660]   So Galatians 5, 24, Paul said,
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.660]   "Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh."
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.340]   So the old self, that which died, called the flesh,
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.740]   what's that?
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.140]   It's the flesh.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.420]   Romans 8, 7, the flesh is hostile to God.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.420]   It's insubordinate.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.140]   It's unable to please God.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.260]   It's our old rebellious self.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.300]   When we became Christians, that self died.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.340]   What about the new self?
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.020]   What's new about the new self?
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.100]   What marks it?
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.540]   The new self is the humble, believing self.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.900]   Galatians 2, 20, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.160]   "It's no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.620]   "And the life I now live, I live by faith
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.860]   "in the Son of God."
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.140]   That's the new me, the me of faith.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.560]   So I died, my old self died.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.460]   The new life is the new life or the new person of faith.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.140]   In other words, my hostile, insubordinate,
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.820]   spiritually paralyzed self died
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.740]   and a new, believing, trusting, dependent,
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.620]   humble self came into being.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.700]   But here's the crucial link with the statement,
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.340]   "Christ is all and in all."
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.340]   Galatians 2, 20 says, "The life I now live,
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.980]   "I live by faith."
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.980]   Yes, but it also says, "It is no longer I who live,
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.620]   "but Christ who lives in me."
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.540]   In me.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.060]   In other words, another way to say
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.060]   that all Christians have put on a new, believing self
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.300]   is to say that all Christians are indwelt by Christ.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.620]   The essence of our newness is that
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.620]   we are not just Christ-trusting and Christ-treasuring,
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.640]   but we are Christ-inhabited.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.420]   Our new life is Christ in us.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.320]   He is our inner life, is our life.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.740]   If he were not there, we would be dead.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.820]   Therefore, when Colossians 3, 11 says,
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.660]   "Christ is all and in all,"
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.420]   the in all is the same as saying
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.980]   we have put off the old self and put on the new.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.980]   Our new self, individually, is Christ-inhabited.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.380]   The Christ-indwelt self, Christ in us, is our newness.
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.080]   The newness of every member,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.960]   this is what it means to be a Christian.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.440]   Every Christian should be able to say this.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.180]   Then, from his place within each of us,
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.940]   from Christ's place within each of us,
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.360]   he makes himself our supreme treasure.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.460]   That's what Paul means in Philippians 1
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.500]   when he says, "To live is Christ, to live is Christ."
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.120]   And in Philippians 3, when he says,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.420]   "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.460]   "of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.860]   "For his sake, I've suffered the loss of everything,
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.220]   "and count them as rubbish in order that I might gain Christ."
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.260]   So, Christ is all means
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.740]   Christ has become more valuable than all.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.120]   And it means whatever besides Christ
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.720]   has value for me, it has that value
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.600]   because of its relation to Christ.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.220]   Now, now we can relate all of this
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.520]   to the relationships in the new community in verse 11.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.540]   So, verse 11 says, "Here, here in this church,
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.000]   "where the old self has gone and the new self is put on,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.320]   "here there is not Greek and Jew,
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.660]   "circumcised and uncircumcised,
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.500]   "barbarian, scythian, slave, free,
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.500]   "but Christ is all and in all.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.020]   "Jew and Greek, the age-old hostilities,
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.780]   "some with covenant privilege,
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.300]   "some with out it and unclean latecomers,
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.940]   "circumcised and uncircumcised,
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.580]   "those who conform in all the traditions
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.900]   "of the privileged people
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.360]   "and those who bear no marks of that privilege.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.620]   "Barbarians, the foreigners, uncultured,
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.820]   "foolish by Greek and Jewish standards
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.740]   "with weird languages like bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar."
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.700]   That's why they're called barbarians, literally.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.700]   "Scythian, the distant people to the north of the Black Sea,
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.660]   "the epitome of unrefinement and savagery,"
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.840]   Josephus wrote, "Scythians who delight in murdering people
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.420]   "are little better than wild dogs,
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.340]   "slave and free, the opposite poles
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.560]   "of the economic strata of society."
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.040]   If Christ is all and if Christ is in all,
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.320]   what becomes of those relationships?
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.160]   Once we boasted in our culture and our intellect
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.640]   like the Greeks, but now Christ is all.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.440]   Once we gloried in our tradition
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.180]   and our religious rigor like the Jews,
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.320]   but now Christ is all.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.280]   Once we got our strokes because of our ethnic pedigree,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.840]   but now Christ is all.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.960]   Once we reveled in not being like the barbarians
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.560]   and the shabby Scythians, but now Christ is all.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.560]   Or once we resented not being the cultured,
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   not being rigorous, not having the cultured pedigree,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.880]   not having wealth and refinement, but now Christ is all.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.120]   Once we tried to find our significance
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.940]   and our happiness and our security
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.080]   in what we were in relation to other people
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.960]   or in distinction from other people.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.540]   We were Jews, we were Greeks, we're circumcised,
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.540]   we're free, we're American, we're rich, we're smart,
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.620]   we're strong, we're pretty, we're witty, we're cool.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.000]   But then that old self died.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   A new self was born and the core essence of the new self
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.100]   is that it knows and feels Christ is all.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.820]   It is no longer I who live,
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.940]   but Christ who lives in me.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.280]   To live is Christ.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.960]   And when someone asks,
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.120]   as I think one of these questioners does,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.060]   does that mean that all the differences,
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.120]   like cultural and ethnic and racial differences,
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.420]   are canceled out because Christ is all?
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.100]   And the answer is no, it doesn't.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.420]   No Jew, no Greek, no barbarian, no Scythian,
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:25.420]   no slave, no freedman remains unchanged here.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:31.020]   Everybody's changed by discovering that Christ is all.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.380]   Lots of things change for everybody,
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.580]   but none, none is obliterated.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.480]   I can see your Jewish nose.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.900]   I can see your Greek forehead.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.700]   I can hear your barbarian accent.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.740]   I can see your Scythian gestures.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.060]   I can see the hole in your earlobe left over.
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.140]   I can see the refinement of your bearing.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.340]   None has ceased to be,
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.420]   except that Christ is in all of you.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.820]   He is your new identity.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.680]   And everything about you is being renewed after Christ.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.600]   And shining as the mark of your new identity
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.440]   is Christ is all.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.200]   - Very good, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.120]   And thanks for the Bible questions, Aaron and Justin.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.320]   If you have a Bible question that you cannot figure out
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.880]   or can't figure out how to apply to your own life,
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.680]   email us through our online home
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.760]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.920]   Well, how do I follow God's lead in my daily decisions?
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.600]   I know he's my shepherd.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.960]   He's leading me, I think.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.840]   But how do I know if I'm following?
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.000]   It's such an important topic and it's up next time.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.240]   I'm your host, Tony Renke,
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.280]   and we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.740]   (Thanks for watching)
