[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   Here's today's email.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.320]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.600]   Is it okay for me, an older Christian man, to marry a Christian woman half my age?
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.680]   I know I will be scoffed for asking such a question.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.480]   Many will assume I'm chasing sex, youth, and beauty.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.920]   However, that's not the case.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.020]   It wasn't until this past year in my late 40s that I found myself for the first time
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.480]   attracted to women.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.700]   I have struggled with same-sex attraction all my life, but I have never acted on those
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.060]   feelings.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.140]   Just recently, I have experienced the Spirit moving me to walk more closely with Him.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.460]   Simultaneously, I have been filled with the desire to get married to a woman and to become
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.460]   a father.
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.200]   I never had such desires before, nor did I think it was ever possible.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.860]   I have felt ignored by God as I watched my friends get married and have children and
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.500]   seemingly get blessed by God, whereas I was always alone.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.620]   Now in middle age, Jesus seems to be changing me, shaping me to become a husband of a wife
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.860]   and the father of her children.
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.500]   There is a young lady I'm friends with, and I find myself thinking about her a lot.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500]   She's exactly half my age.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.260]   I'm old enough to be her father.
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.100]   Is such an age gap acceptable among believers?
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.040]   I think the first thing I would like to say is a word of thanks to God and then a word
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.220]   of commendation to our friend in his late 40s, that in spite of the brokenness of this
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.420]   fallen world manifest in his same-sex attraction all his life, he has not been disobedient
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.820]   to God's call on his life to be sexually upright in abstaining from homosexual practice.
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.540]   That is a remarkable triumph of God's grace, and for that I give public thanks to God and
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.200]   commendation to our friend.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:02.780]   The Apostle Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 4.3, "This is the will of God, your sanctification,
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.220]   that you abstain from sexual immorality, that each of you know how to control his own body
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.320]   in holiness and honor."
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.440]   And I know that many people today think that such instructions concerning the will of God
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:30.060]   for our sexuality are simply human power moves, a means of shaming and oppressing and constricting
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.000]   and denying one's full humanity, when in fact God's ways are good and wise and far
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.140]   more satisfying than the lawlessness of this world, especially when you take into account
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.740]   all of reality and all of eternity.
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.540]   So I praise God for any instance like this one of triumph over the God of this world
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.460]   and over the power of sin for Christ's sake.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.260]   This does mean, however, that the case in front of us is more complex than simply a
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.180]   matter of age.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.140]   He has honestly stirred in the matter of his own experience of same-sex attraction.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.700]   The question he puts is, "I am 48, she's 24."
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.100]   I'm just guessing because he said late 40s and twice her age, so let's say 48 and 24.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.840]   I am 48, she's 24.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.720]   Is such a gap acceptable among believers?
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.060]   And he probably knows as well as I that the question of this marriage is not going to
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.100]   be settled by an explicit biblical command.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.420]   There isn't one that forbids this gap or commands it.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.060]   The issue is resolved.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.020]   It's going to be resolved by reflection on biblical principles which we pray will yield
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.820]   mature wisdom and discernment.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:06.820]   So two brief thoughts. First, about the challenges of same-sex attraction in heterosexual marriage.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.380]   It would be wrong, I think, of me to overlook that issue.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.100]   The first is that the Bible puts a very high value on sexual relations in marriage.
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.940]   1 Corinthians 7, 4, and 5, Paul says, "The husband should give his wife her sexual rights,
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.980]   and likewise the wife to her husband.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.020]   For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.300]   Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.700]   Do not deprive one another," meaning of sexual relations, "except perhaps by agreement
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.260]   for a limited time."
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.420]   In other words, both husband and wife should seek and find in the marriage partner what
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.180]   they need for sexual satisfaction.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.700]   Neither should be deprived by the other.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.860]   Therefore, those who enter into marriage should be confident that they can fulfill this.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.380]   The other thought is simply this.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:21.100]   A woman in marriage should have her husband's entire sexual affection.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:31.060]   His desires, his eyes, his actions should never go after another woman sexually or another man.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:38.220]   In this way, he loves her, he honors her, she feels cherished as the unique and sole
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.340]   focus of his sexual pursuit.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.260]   Both man and woman should enter into marriage with that expectation.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:57.540]   Now, with regard to the age difference, there's no biblical prohibition of a 48-year-old man
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.780]   marrying a 24-year-old woman.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:08.660]   The question is, will this difference present challenges that may prove so great that the
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.940]   marriage would not last or the marriage would be mainly miserable?
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:20.620]   That's a question for the man and the woman to think through, study through, pray through
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:28.940]   with much counsel from not a podcast like me, but a pastor or some close spiritual associates
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.900]   who know them well.
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.260]   They should be in a strong Bible-believing church.
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.740]   So let me mention a few things to take into consideration from my distance.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.740]   Statistically, the greater the gap in ages, the greater the likelihood of divorce.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:54.360]   One group of statistics that I consulted said that a gap of 10 years increases the likelihood
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.340]   of divorce by 39 percent.
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.980]   A gap of 20 years increases the likelihood of divorce by 95 percent.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.220]   A gap of 30 years increases the likelihood by 172 percent.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:15.340]   So if three out of 10 marriages fail, if both are 25 years old, then 8.7 marriages out of
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:22.260]   10 fail when the 25-year-old marries a 55-year-old.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:31.520]   Now one of the reasons for that failure rate is no doubt that physiologically, mentally,
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.980]   the gap widens as you get older rather than shrinking.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:43.980]   The physical difference between a 48-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman is negligible.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.140]   Mentally, physically, they can do all the same things.
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:54.100]   But when she's a vital, energetic 56, he will be 80.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:08:00.900]   And the strength and the mental acuity of an 80-year-old does not relate to a 56-year-old
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.100]   the same way a 48-year-old relates to a 24-year-old.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.380]   So both partners need to take very seriously this fact.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:21.780]   The experience of aging will not be a shared experience as it is in most marriages.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.620]   This will present unique challenges for both.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:34.740]   So let me venture one other exhortation and a kind of warning for this man in particular.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:40.540]   In order to flourish within those peculiar challenges, which is possible, by the way,
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:46.300]   it is possible where there's great biblical maturity and great wisdom and great love,
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:56.220]   I think our friend will need to be sure that he has grown in his relationship to God beyond
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.640]   what I heard in his question.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:09.420]   He said, "I have felt ignored by God as I watched my friends get married and have children
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:15.500]   and seemingly get blessed by God, whereas I was always alone."
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   Now that's an understandable feeling, not a good one, not a mature one.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:31.900]   I could be very wrong, but I hear a view of God that is not as big and wise and trustworthy
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.840]   as it ought to be.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:41.860]   And I hear a relationship to God that is not as deeply shaped by God's good and wise sovereignty
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.100]   as it ought to be.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:52.340]   It's not a sign of mature, stable faith when a Christian feels ignored by God, as if other
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.580]   people are more loved by God than he is.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:01.980]   Either the view of God is flawed or faith is flawed.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:08.540]   And so I would exhort our friend to go deep into the sovereignty of God, go deep into
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:16.160]   the goodness of God, go deep into the wisdom of God and sink your roots down so deep into
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.780]   God's sovereign grace that you are so firm in your sense of his sovereign care and love
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:30.720]   for you that you never feel abandoned by him, no matter what good is coming to other people
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.220]   or what bad is happening to you.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:48.020]   Then I think you will be in a very good position to say a faith-filled yes or no to marriage
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.740]   to a woman half your age.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.360]   Thank you, Pastor John, for walking through all the various entailments of this scenario.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.460]   And thanks for the question.
