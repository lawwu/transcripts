[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John Podcast with longtime pastor and author John Piper.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.720]   Today's question is an important one and it comes from a listener named Daniel.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.320]   "Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.360]   Very often Christians point out the sin of homosexuality is a major problem in this country,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.440]   while they seemingly forget about the massive amounts of sinners addicted to other sinful
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.460]   patterns in life.
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.040]   Is homosexuality truly more detrimental to a society than other sins?
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.500]   How would you weigh the cultural impact of this sin against, say, the sins of pride and
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.440]   overeating and greed?"
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.680]   Pastor John, how would you answer that question from Daniel?
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.860]   My answer to the last question can be straightforward.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:57.400]   I do not doubt that millions more people are ruined in this life and the next through greed
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.480]   and covetousness, through pride, through selfishness, through excessive anger, than are ruined through
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.320]   same-sex orientation or through homosexual behavior.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.880]   And the reason for that opinion on my part is twofold.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:27.000]   One, on the one hand, the sins of greed and pride and selfishness and anger are more widespread
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.840]   than either same-sex attraction or homosexual behavior.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.600]   And on the other hand, the sins of greed and pride and selfishness and anger are more subtle
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.360]   and disguise themselves more easily as acceptable.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.760]   So yes, the number of people who are ruined in this life and the next by the sins of greed,
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.880]   pride, selfishness, anger is vastly greater than the number of people ruined by same-sex
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.100]   orientation or sinful homosexual behavior.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.840]   And I would add, the social miseries brought about through those sins are also vastly greater
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.200]   in scope than any brought about through homosexual sin.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.800]   Now my guess is that Daniel didn't want me to stop there because that's my answer to
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.960]   his question, but probably would want me now to ask the question implicit in my answer,
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.520]   namely, well then, why is so much attention paid to homosexuality?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.960]   I think that's probably behind his question.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.760]   All of us function in different circles of humanity and I don't know anything about Daniel's
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.040]   context.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.200]   In my context, the people that I watch most closely in leadership certainly do take note
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.520]   of Daniel's very point, namely that homosexuality is no more deadly a sin and certainly no more
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.500]   widespread than greed and pride and selfishness and anger.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.040]   The people that I function among are keenly aware of this and are eager to make it plain
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.600]   as I am now.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.260]   It may not, however, be the case in Daniel's situation, I don't know.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:17.400]   So let me suggest three things about why I think homosexuality is getting such attention
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   in our day.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.280]   Number one, it's because the media feature this issue.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.320]   It isn't Christians who put homosexuality in the news.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.700]   Christians are drawn to explain our position in public through preaching and writing as
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.760]   often as we do these days because the media have made the issue so public that we feel
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.520]   we need to serve Christians with careful biblical answers and we need to clarify for non-Christians
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   how we think.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.880]   I mean this podcast right now is a good example of this.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.680]   Number two, and more importantly I think, unlike the sins of greed with its counterpart
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.240]   stealing and pride with its counterpart the humiliating of others and selfishness with
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.560]   its counterpart of exploiting others and anger with its counterpart of malice and abusiveness,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.920]   unlike these sins, homosexual behavior has articulate and forceful advocates, advocates,
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.080]   defenders.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.360]   This is one of the things that makes the sin of homosexual intercourse stand out today.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.560]   If there were strident and articulate and forceful publishing advocates for greed and
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.300]   stealing and pride and humiliating others and selfishness and the exploitation of others
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.960]   and anger and abusiveness, if these sins were being publicly advocated, then they would
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.280]   probably get more press as well.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.840]   But you find few, if any, people trying to normalize stealing and normalize humiliation
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.440]   and normalize exploitation and normalize angry abusiveness.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.440]   But you find thousands of people trying to normalize homosexual behavior.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.560]   That's the second reason why it has a unique place in our society right now.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.520]   It is a sin with forceful advocates.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:33.840]   Third, homosexual intercourse has an unusual status in our moral discourse because it is
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.880]   in a peculiar way going against nature.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.520]   The apostle Paul describes it like this.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.280]   God gave them up to a dishonorable passion for their women exchanged natural relations
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.200]   for those that are contrary to nature.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.680]   And the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.840]   for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.240]   the due penalty of their error.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:14.200]   So to repeat my answer, I don't doubt that millions more people are ruined in this life
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:25.280]   and the next through greed, pride, selfishness, excessive anger, than are ruined through same-sex
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.120]   orientation or through homosexual behavior.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.840]   The reason for the attention that homosexual behavior is getting is not because it destroys
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.760]   more people, but because one, it makes news.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.200]   Two, it's a public sin with forceful advocates.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.760]   And three, it is peculiarly contrary to nature.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:00.240]   So those of us who believe that same-sex orientation is a distortion of nature and that it may
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:07.720]   result in sinful homosexual intercourse are called upon, like I'm being called upon right
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:16.440]   now, to record answers to questions like this and therefore be public about this and emphasize
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.480]   that Jesus Christ, and I end with this.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.600]   It's the most important thing I have to say.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:30.360]   And emphasize that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into the world to save sinners,
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:39.080]   heterosexual sinners and homosexual sinners, greedy, proud, selfish, angry sinners and
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.900]   sinners who commit homosexual acts.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:50.680]   We all need the same Savior and the blood of Christ is sufficient to wash away every
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:08:01.360]   sin and remove all judgment and bring us to everlasting healing and joy.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.800]   This is an incredibly insightful answer, Pastor John.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.760]   Thank you for diving into this complex issue and addressing the controversy once again.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.760]   And Daniel, thank you for the question.
