[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140]   - Have you done a lot with smart home sensors
[00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.280]   just around the house to monitor different things?
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.600]   - Oh yeah, the house is so airtight
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.960]   that it needs something called an energy recovery ventilator
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.240]   that's always bringing in fresh outside air
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.080]   and exhausting stale inside air.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.320]   A concern with a system like that
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.380]   is humidity levels might get too high
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.620]   or CO2 levels might get kind of high.
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.280]   So I've got sensors all over this house
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.080]   that are just monitoring temperature, humidity,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.320]   and CO2 and particulate matter, all that kind of stuff.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560]   And I'm setting up automations in my house
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.360]   so that if CO2 levels get too high,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.240]   the ERV will just ramp up a little bit
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.840]   just to make sure that air is changing as it needs to.
