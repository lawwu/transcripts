[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   Lots of things to share today, from some of the best deals I've seen lately, to my first
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.040]   time calling 9-1-1, booking award travel for the summer, some Father's Day gift ideas,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.520]   a family update from us, and more.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.240]   Hello, I am Chris Hutchins, and this is All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.680]   money, and travel.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.760]   Today is something new.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.920]   I'm going to call it Monday Musings because, well, it's Monday, and I have a lot on my
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.920]   mind.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.640]   In fact, this idea came to me this morning while I was on a run, and I just kept thinking
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.200]   about more and more things to include, which usually doesn't happen on my runs, but it's
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.400]   probably because I'm normally running with my wife, Amy, who is not able to run with
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.200]   me right now for a few months.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.200]   More on that later.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.040]   So, yes, this is a deviation from our normal show.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.320]   We'll be back to a regular episode on Wednesday.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.480]   It's actually an incredible episode about redeeming points and miles for the maximum
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.680]   value, so definitely check that out.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.200]   Also, given the short turnaround, because I'm recording this the same day I'm going
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.320]   to release it, and it happens to be a holiday, I am editing this one myself, so cut me some
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.320]   slack.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.440]   Finally, since this covers a wide range of topics, I will remind you that we do put timestamps
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.000]   to everything in the show notes, so you can jump around, and unless you're on Apple Podcasts,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240]   I have no idea why they don't support this feature.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.000]   You can actually just click those timestamps on every other player and jump to that part
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   of the episode.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.600]   So, let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.960]   Okay, the first thing is a really short one, but I want to remind you all to smile.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.120]   Credit to Matt Wilbers on the Peloton app who gave me that reminder during my run this
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.960]   morning, but it is just wild how smiling can sometimes make you feel better.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960]   Just try it right now.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.200]   It feels good.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.600]   So, next, I want to talk about the intros to this podcast.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.320]   So, if you've watched any of our episodes on YouTube recently, you've probably noticed
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.040]   we've been doing a bit of a different style intro, which naturally has made me think about
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.760]   what kind of intros to do with the podcast on audio outside of YouTube.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.600]   So, over the next month, I'm going to test a few things out.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.040]   You might have heard a little bit of a different intro today, and I'd love to know what you
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.040]   think.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.200]   If you're on Spotify, they have a cool feature where I can do a pop-up poll that I'm going
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   to try.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.920]   Otherwise, you can let me know on Twitter, Instagram, email.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.960]   I'm just podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.400]   Also, for a little context on why this is all happening, it's because there's a little
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.240]   bit of a shift with audio and video in the industry.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.080]   Spotify is starting to allow podcasters to add video on their platform, and YouTube has
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.840]   moved to a place that if you want to use the YouTube music app to listen to podcasts, you
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.640]   can only get those as a listener if the publisher, meaning the podcast like me, is putting them
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.840]   out on YouTube.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.920]   So, a lot of things are changing, and it probably won't affect most of you, but I'm starting
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.360]   to think about how video and audio fit in together in the future.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   Okay.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.960]   Let's talk about some of the latest deals.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   If you subscribe to my newsletter, which I know many of you do, thank you, some of those
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.160]   deals that you get are going to be familiar to what I'm talking about today, but not all
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   of them.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.320]   That's because every two weeks, and hopefully soon every week on Saturday morning, I send
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.980]   out an email with all the latest things I'm finding, which includes deals, news, credit
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.900]   card offers, products, movies, TV show recommendations, and a lot more.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.600]   I thought today what I'd do is I'd give you a preview of what that content looks like
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.320]   and walk through what's in a newsletter so that you guys listening know what you might
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.720]   get if you sign up and pick up a little bit of cool stuff today.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.280]   For those who already subscribe, I added a few extra things as well.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.540]   And if you're not subscribed and you want to, go to allthehacks.com/email to get the
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.080]   latest deals, news, finds, and more in your inbox every two weeks.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.580]   So first, I'll talk about deals.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.780]   So there are a bunch of card-linked offers lately, and those are when you log into Amex
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.460]   or Chase or whatever your platform is, and you can add deals to specific cards.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.620]   So on the Amex side, Air France, Dell, Hilton, JetBlue, Delta, Hertz, IHG, and Lyft all have
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.220]   deals that range from $15 off $50 all the way up to $200 off $1,000.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.380]   A lot of them expire in June, some of them even further than that.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.200]   And then on the Chase side, IHG, Resort Pass, DoorDash, Westin, and Turo all have offers
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.540]   for anywhere from $10 to 20% back.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.300]   Some of those are through the end of May, some of those are pushed out till June.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.020]   Next there's a deal for today only where you can get 5X bonus miles on Apple purchases
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.260]   through the Alaska, American, Delta, and United shopping portals.
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.600]   So if you have anything from Apple on your plans, today might be a good day to do it.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.040]   Next I want to talk about built and how you can start earning even more built points.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.660]   They just added 20,000 restaurants to built dining.
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.460]   And so even if you don't have a built card, you can use a Chase, Amex, anything, and link
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.020]   that to your built account, which you can create for free.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.220]   And then when you go to any of the restaurants in their network, you start earning built
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.220]   points.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.100]   Now built points are some of the most valuable points out there.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.700]   You can transfer them to almost every hotel group as well as United, Alaska, Aeroplan,
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.780]   Life Miles.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.440]   There's so many great options.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.060]   And this is one way to get them without the built card.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.700]   I know some of the restaurants near us that we already frequent.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.900]   I now get 3X points at when I'm using any card I have.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.080]   However, if you do have the built card, I'm really excited because in four days it's another
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.820]   rent day and on the first of the month you get double your points.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.100]   So that means that built is going to offer 6X on dining, 4X on travel, and 2X on everything
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.100]   else.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.760]   So that's something I always take advantage of.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.900]   These built dining rewards stack on top of that, which is awesome.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.700]   And one more hack is that I've been using built rent days to go and buy gift cards at
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.860]   restaurants we frequent a lot because let's face it, we don't always go out on the first
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.860]   of the month.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.060]   And one cool way to do that is if the restaurant uses Toast, which is toasttab.com or the Toast
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.460]   app, you can easily buy gift cards for those restaurants in the Toast app, which has been
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.460]   awesome.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.060]   Finally, on rent day they have a trivia game that you can play and earn more free points.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.820]   So if you want to sign up for a free built account, you can do it at allthehacks.com/built.
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.380]   Also on the deal side, we've recently shared deals to get 10% off gift cards at 100 different
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.380]   brands.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.380]   That deal's expired.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.100]   And then Southwest gift cards were on sale for 16% off at Costco and Sam's Club.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.380]   That deal has expired, though funny enough it looks like they are back on sale at Costco
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.380]   again.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.380]   I'm not sure how long that'll last.
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.320]   But those are some of the deals we like to share in the newsletter.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.060]   On the points and miles front, we share things like right now it's Hilton Double Point summer
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.060]   promo.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.980]   So if you register, you can earn 2x points for all stays at Hilton between May 2nd and
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.560]   September 2nd.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.740]   There's no limit on how much you can earn.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.260]   We also shared a bunch of the transfer bonuses you can get when transferring points from
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.700]   Amex City Chase to different airlines and hotel groups.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.180]   Right now through the end of May, there's three.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.260]   Amex has 20% to Aeromexico and 30% to Virgin Atlantic, and City has 30% bonus points to
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.620]   Qatar Air.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.260]   And then through June 15th, Chase has a transfer bonus of 30% to Virgin Atlantic and to Marriott
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.700]   for a 40% bonus, and then City has a 50% bonus to Turkish Miles and Smiles through the same
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.700]   date.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.880]   I also love to share when there are cards that are launching or have new signup bonuses.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.880]   So the City Premier was recently relaunched as the almost identical City Strata Premier.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.620]   It's always gotten and still gets 3x on airfare, hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, and gas
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.020]   stations, but it now also gets 3x on EV charging.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.620]   They also added some travel protections, and they increased the welcome bonus to 75,000
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.180]   thank you points after you spend $4,000 in three months.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.540]   The only catch is you can't have received the bonus for a City Premier in the last 48
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.540]   months.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.900]   So I'm debating whether I jump on this because I don't have a City card yet.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.660]   There is a rumor that there might be a City Strata Elite card coming sometime.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.260]   I'd love to know if that's coming before I decide whether I do this.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.980]   And then last, the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Reserve cards both have an increased welcome
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.300]   offer right now up to 75,000 points after you spend $4,000 in three months.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.460]   That kind of a deal for both cards works out to about 20 points per dollar if you include
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.960]   the points you get from that spend.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.220]   But on the Chase side, you can't get the bonus if you have either card right now or if you've
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.460]   earned the bonus from either card in the past 48 months.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.140]   And obviously for all Chase cards, you have to be under Chase's 5/24 rule, which means
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:25.020]   you can't have opened five cards across all issuers in the last 24 months, at least cards
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.680]   that show up on your credit report.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.820]   So sometimes business cards won't count.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.940]   But a common strategy for people that already have one of these cards and want the bonus
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:37.260]   again is to downgrade to the Freedom Flex or the Freedom Unlimited, wait a week or so,
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.340]   and then reapply.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:44.480]   Obviously for cards, I'd appreciate you using our links if they have the best deals.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.780]   We don't have any City links, so you can go anywhere there.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.140]   And if you can get a better deal with a referral from your Player 2, go there.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.220]   Otherwise, allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.380]   Last thing in travel points and miles is United, without any announcement, rolled out more
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.500]   devaluations to some of their partner awards.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:08.060]   So if you're looking to book ANA First Class to Japan, it's gone from 121 to 242,000 miles,
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.380]   so doubled.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:14.660]   It's kind of a trend that United seems to be increasing partner awards without any notice.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:20.540]   So I've really focused most of my booking on Star Alliance from Air Canada or Avianca
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.780]   instead of from United.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.740]   I also like to share in the newsletter some great finds that I've had.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.300]   Recently I found a good video from Dr. Peter Attia that talks about why time isn't really
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.820]   the best factor when it comes to exercise and some of the indicators that might make
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.260]   for good exercise like VO2 max and muscle mass.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:44.020]   Nick Gray, who's a past podcast guest, recently went on a publicly arranged blind date where
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.220]   he solicited recommendations for someone to meet him in Tokyo for a few days.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.760]   He posted daily about everything that was happening.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.740]   He chronicled all the posts in a wrap-up on his blog.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.100]   It was so interesting.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.020]   I was literally like waiting for him to write his next post so I could see what was happening.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.020]   So that was a fun one.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.300]   And then there was a cool article I found from Vox just about why car insurance rates
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.880]   have been going up so much.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.640]   So I'll link to all of those in the newsletter, allthehacks.com/email.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.260]   And then last, in the newsletters I like to share recommendations, kind of similar to
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.540]   Great Finds, but things that I really enjoyed.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.300]   On the movie front, I recommended the Tetris movie if anyone hasn't seen it.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.980]   I thought it was really awesome and I'd never seen or heard the story behind that game,
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.120]   which was fascinating.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.060]   It's on Apple TV+.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.220]   Also recommended Superhuman.
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.100]   It's really the fastest email out there.
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.280]   I've saved so much time since I've used it.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.060]   It works on Gmail or Outlook.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.700]   It works with keyboard shortcuts.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.140]   They have an AI to write emails.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.140]   It's really great.
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.860]   I'm sure I left off a ton of features, but you can actually try it for a month for free
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.660]   at allthehacks.com/superhuman, or you can use the code ALLTHEHACKS.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.660]   And last, I shared a show that I kind of just finished binging called Trafficked on YouTube
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.620]   with Mariana Van Zeller.
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:03.140]   It is wild how deep she as a host goes in this docuseries where she's kind of exploring
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:08.320]   these really dangerous inner workings of kind of global underworld, I guess, everything
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.620]   from drug cartels to black market organs, online romance scams.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.860]   You can watch it on YouTube, Hulu, and the Nat Geo website.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.860]   Really liked it.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.820]   So that's what I typically share in a newsletter.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.220]   You can go to allthehacks.com/email to read some past ones and subscribe, and I'll be
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.780]   sending another one on Saturday with some particularly awesome hotel deals related to
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.720]   cards that have come up recently, as well as some other stuff.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.460]   Next topic today, which actually might end up being in that newsletter next week, is
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.620]   around Father's Day.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.500]   I had a few friends ask me if I had any ideas, and so I wanted to pull together a few in
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.580]   no particular order.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.820]   One is the Moft snap-on phone stand and wallet for the iPhone.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.880]   It uses MagSafe to kind of magnetically connect.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.220]   It says it holds two cards.
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.540]   I found that it holds three cards and a couple dollar bills.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.540]   Moft.us is where you can find that.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.100]   The Ooni Pizza Oven is great.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.300]   I actually, we just used one at a neighbor's house.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.220]   I love making pizza at home.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.380]   We've given that as a gift in the past.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:12.100]   I really love, for someone who likes cocktails, the Cocktail Codex book.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.100]   It's fantastic.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.780]   A friend of mine's really into hoodies and has tried like 15 different hoodies in search
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.380]   of the best one.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:25.300]   He claims that so far the 10,000 mid-weight tech hoodie is the best one, and he actually
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.780]   sent me one, and it's fantastic.
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.760]   I'm still a big fan, from talking about that run this morning, two products.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.420]   One is the Shox Open Run Pro headphones.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.340]   I mentioned them in my gift guide last year, and I still really enjoy them.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.180]   They're open ear, so you can kind of hear what's going on around you better.
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.900]   The other thing on the run is the Nike Vaporfly 3 shoes.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.380]   It might be any number.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.380]   They might have a 4 now.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.380]   I'm not sure.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.160]   I remember reading about these shoes in 2020 when there was an article about whether shoes
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.660]   can actually make you run fast, and there's been debate about banning these shoes.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.860]   Well, just for a test, when I first got them, I finished a normal 30-minute run, checked
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:08.060]   my distance, and it was a little shy of 10% further than any 30-minute run I'd done the
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.780]   past year, so if you want to help someone run faster, Nike Vaporflys are great.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.020]   Next, we got an 8Sleep last year.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.420]   We absolutely love it.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.220]   If you haven't seen, they launched the new Pod 4 Ultra, which is even better.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.160]   There's actually a $200 discount that we got them to give us for listeners.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.020]   It's allthehacks.com/8sleep, and if you're on the fence, they have a really generous
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.060]   30-day return policy, and they even cover return shipping.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.900]   A gift certificate for an escape room.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.380]   I'm a huge escape room fan, or if you want to give someone a solo kind of escape room
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:43.420]   board game vibe at home, Box One from Theory 11 is an amazing game.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.060]   It's like a solo game/escape room.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.500]   I loved it.
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.500]   And then my good friends Heather and Jonathan started an outdoor game during the pandemic
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.420]   called Tug-o-Wobble.
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.340]   Think of it like tug-of-war, but with a little bit of a twist where you're standing on these
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.340]   platforms.
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.500]   It's really fun.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.980]   They're having a sale right now that goes through tomorrow, 5/28 for Memorial Day, to
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.340]   get 25% off.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.900]   I'll link to all these things in the show notes.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.940]   And then finally, I think you all know that most of the brands we work with as sponsors
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.460]   are brands that we reached out to because we love the products.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.840]   And so it's no surprise that there are actually four products that I wanted to include on
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.060]   this list, but I just thought it would be fair to say they are sponsors of the show
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.060]   as well.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.220]   They actually don't know I'm mentioning them and haven't paid to be here, but I think they
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.220]   make fantastic gifts.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:35.620]   StoryWorth, if you want to create amazing books of stories of your father, it's a great
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.620]   gift.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.060]   You can get $10 off at allthehacks.com/storyworth.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.700]   Viore, most comfortable clothes out there.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.980]   I'm wearing Viore pants and I'm wearing a Viore shirt right now as I record.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.980]   I love Viore.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.180]   I wore them on the run this morning.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.020]   The core shorts are awesome.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:58.380]   Sunday performance joggers, you can get those 15% off, allthehacks.com/viore, V-U-O-R-E.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.460]   Funny enough, I gave StoryWorth to my dad last year and two years ago, I gave him a
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:07.500]   subscription to Masterclass, which is amazing online content to learn just about anything
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:13.460]   from really world-renowned experts, 15% off at allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.240]   And then the last is a new sponsor, which I've actually used their products for over
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.460]   a decade, which is Indochino.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.060]   They're the suit I bought for my wedding.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.800]   I still wear it to this day.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.460]   And if you want to get someone a new suit for Father's Day, you can get 10% off with
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.460]   the code allthehacks.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:33.300]   Next, I want to share something a little personal before I jump into booking award travel for
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.300]   the summer.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.180]   So almost a decade ago, my father-in-law did a genetic test and found out he had the BRCA2
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.340]   gene mutation.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:45.380]   For those not familiar, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that help repair DNA damage.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.580]   And when you have a mutation in them, the genes can't necessarily repair things effectively
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.500]   and it increases the risk for different types of cancers, particularly breast and ovarian
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.500]   cancer.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.860]   And the increased risk is pretty meaningful.
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.220]   If you look at a National Cancer Institute article, it compiled a bunch of research and
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.240]   the summary was 13% of women in the general population will develop breast cancer sometime
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.400]   in their lives.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:15.300]   But if they have the BRCA1 mutation, that increase goes to 55% to 72% by the time they're
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.940]   70 to 80 years old.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.860]   And on the BRCA2 side, it goes to 45% to 69%.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.460]   So a very significant increase.
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:30.460]   On the ovarian cancer side, it goes from 1.2% for the general population to 39% to 44% for
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:35.300]   BRCA1 and 11% to 17% for BRCA2 by age 70 to 80.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.340]   It has a lot of impact on other cancers.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.180]   For example, 6% of people by age 69 have prostate cancer.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:48.220]   On BRCA1 side, it jumps up to 21% by 75 and 29% by 85.
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:53.540]   And BRCA2 jumps up to 27% by 75 and 60% by 85.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.380]   Now these mutations can be inherited from parents.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:01.020]   And so if one of your parents has a BRCA mutation, there's a 50% chance you'll inherit it.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.100]   And so my wife did a genetic test, which I think it was from either Color or Invitae,
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.160]   and she found out she has the BRCA2 mutation.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.940]   After learning this, Amy reached out to her doctors at UCSF who recommended she speak
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.820]   with their BRCA team.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:20.380]   And a common course of action is actually a preventative mastectomy or oophorectomy,
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.980]   which is the removal of the breasts and the ovaries.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.020]   Now as you can imagine, that's a very serious set of procedures that someone will have to
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.440]   make a decision about.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.820]   And Stanford actually has this amazing decision tool for women to play with some of the numbers
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.960]   for people with the BRCA mutations.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.500]   And it highlights the benefits of those procedures and actually shows some examples.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.340]   And I'm just going to read them because I thought it was really impactful.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:48.580]   So what it shows is that for 100 women aged 35 to 39 years old with a BRCA1 mutation who
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:54.960]   are doing regular screenings, by age 70, 15 of them will be alive and have never had either
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960]   cancer.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.820]   73 will have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer, and of them, 28 will have died of
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.820]   it.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.620]   And then there are 12 other women who would have died from other causes.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.820]   And having both of those procedures before 40 years old increases the number out of 100
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:18.100]   people who will be alive without having cancer by 4X from 15 to 60 and reduces the number
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:23.540]   who have had either cancer from 73 down to 25 and also reduces the number of people who
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.980]   died from either of those two cancers from 28 to 8.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.180]   So those are the numbers for the BRCA1 mutation.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.500]   For BRCA2, which is what Amy has, it's slightly better, but it's still not what you want to
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.500]   see.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.700]   So for 100 women 35 to 39 years old with BRCA2 who are doing regular screenings, by
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:46.380]   age 70, 37 will be alive and have never had breast cancer or ovarian cancer.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.700]   50 will be alive having had breast or ovarian cancer, and 11 of them will have died from
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.700]   it.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.780]   Then 13 other women would have died from other causes.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:01.220]   And if you have BRCA2 and you get both of those preventative procedures done before
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.340]   40, it increases the number out of 100 who will be alive without having either cancer
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:12.740]   2X from 37 to 74 and reduces the number of people who have had either cancer from 50
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:18.260]   to just 11 and reduces the number who died from either cancer from 11 to 2.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.540]   So I know I threw a lot of numbers out there, but I think that data makes a really strong
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.500]   case for both procedures.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.840]   But given the impact on having children and breastfeeding, Amy and her doctors ultimately
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.940]   decided to hold off on anything other than frequent screening until she finished having
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.940]   children and breastfeeding, which was last year.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:41.620]   So being the incredible and courageous woman she is, last week Amy had her double mastectomy,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.020]   which seems so far to have gone as well as it could have.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.340]   She's probably going to do her ovarian removal next year, which because it can likely be
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:54.420]   done laparoscopically will be much less invasive with a much shorter recovery.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:59.300]   As for now, she is recovering at home and it is so tough to have to explain to the kids
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.940]   why mommy can't pick them up, but they are taking it well and we're just all really excited
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.100]   for her to be fully recovered and to take a family trip, which we're planning on the
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.300]   other side of this at the end of the summer.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.940]   So part of the reason I shared that is just because it's something we never knew about
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.620]   before going into this.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:21.040]   The testing was something that only really came up because her father tested for it.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.860]   And I just thought it was interesting and knowledge that some people might want to have,
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.540]   especially if you're in the middle of this situation.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.540]   However, there is one more part of the journey that while very difficult in the moment and
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:37.480]   hard for us, had some valuable takeaways that I wanted to also share.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:43.140]   So last Wednesday morning, Amy was discharged and we came home and she was mostly resting.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.900]   After dinner, she decided to stay downstairs and I helped drain some of the fluid from
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.460]   the tubes that they leave in for a few weeks after surgery.
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:55.420]   Now I'm not sure why, but afterwards Amy felt a bit nauseous and we decided to help her
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.740]   get upstairs to lie down and about halfway there, she decided she wanted to sit down
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.260]   and took a break on the bottom of the stairs and she ended up passing out.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:09.100]   Now she was completely unresponsive for what was actually only about 20 to 30 seconds,
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.540]   but felt like way longer.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.820]   While absolutely terrifying, I immediately called 911.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.460]   Her mom propped her up and very shortly she came back to it.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.880]   She said she felt like she had just fallen asleep.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.640]   Very quickly the paramedics arrived.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.660]   Thank you so much for all first responders.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.660]   They checked her vitals.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.840]   They didn't really find anything wrong at all, but of course they still suggested she
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.780]   go to the ER to get checked out either in the ambulance or we could drive her.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.520]   Now it's 9 30 PM when this happens.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.460]   After having had surgery, the absolute last thing Amy wanted to do was to go sit in an
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.100]   ER for hours.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:51.400]   So fortunately I decided to call a good friend and ER physician, a guy named Bill Yount,
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.620]   who happens to also host an amazing podcast called Catching Up to Phi, where he basically
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.900]   covers the financial independence journey for people who are getting a late start.
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.580]   I've been a guest, so thank you Bill for having me on.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.700]   Bill didn't want to give me personal medical advice, but he wanted to talk about the situation.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.820]   He pointed out a few things that would have been warning signs of something much more
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:17.480]   serious like a pulmonary embolism, and those warning signs made me want to share this story
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.480]   with you.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.780]   And the two things were whether it came out of nowhere or not.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:27.340]   So Amy was feeling a bit nauseous for a few minutes before she fainted, so that was actually
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.540]   pretty positive.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.380]   And then the second was whether it was accompanied by shortness of breath, difficulty breathing,
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.940]   lots of sweats, which it was not.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:41.720]   Now Bill's professional advice was to go to the ER, be seen by a doctor, rule out something
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.820]   more serious.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:48.060]   However, personally, he said if it were him and his wife, it sounded like a safe situation
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:53.440]   to stay home, and that it likely could have been a vasovagal syncope, which is a common
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.420]   cause of fainting that happens when your heart rate and blood pressure suddenly drop, reducing
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.660]   your blood flow to your brain, causing you to lose consciousness for a short time.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.300]   Some common triggers of that are seeing blood, standing up too quickly, or being in a stressful
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:12.700]   situation, all of which were present that night, so ultimately we decided to stay home
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.220]   and we haven't had any issues since.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:20.640]   Amy has been resting more, not watching when the tubes are drained, and staying very hydrated.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.740]   So I wanted to share that because I thought maybe it would be interesting, maybe it would
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.740]   be useful.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.620]   Honestly, I hope it's not useful to any of you because you never have to deal with any
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.660]   of those situations, but it's something that I thought I would share today.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.820]   So thank you so much for listening.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:39.380]   I'm going to take a little bit of a turn here and talk about summer travel with points,
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.500]   and it's relevant because we're going to be taking a summer trip with points after Amy's
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.860]   recovery, and it's tough because in the summer, it seems like everyone in the United States
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.540]   wants to take a vacation.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.820]   So I first want to tell you a story about summer travel, but related to a friend of
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.840]   mine who, funny enough, is also named Bill.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.560]   He was looking to take a trip from Seattle to London and come back a few weeks later
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.620]   from Paris back to Seattle.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:06.420]   He had very specific dates, he wanted to fly direct, maybe one stop, and he was willing
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.740]   to pay to do it in business class for three people, but he was sitting on a lot of points
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.300]   and wanted to see if he could get a good deal.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:17.700]   Now when he looked, each one way from Seattle to London and from Paris back to Seattle was
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.300]   about $5,000.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:24.100]   When we looked at points, we found an option to go from Seattle to London direct on Virgin
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:29.660]   Atlantic booked through Air France for 105,000 points and $200.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:35.340]   Comparing that to $5,000 was about 4.6 cents per point, which is a great, great, great
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.340]   value.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.780]   And just for anyone trying to understand the math there, I took $5,000, which was the fare,
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.240]   minus $200 to account for the taxes and fees you have to pay on the award ticket, which
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:53.340]   comes out to $4,800, and then I divide that by 105,000 points, which gets you 0.0457,
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.900]   or about 4.6 cents per point.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.900]   So that was great.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:02.700]   But the return was a bit tougher, and the best option we found was one stop on United
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:10.220]   a day later for 175,000 points and $150, which works out to about 2.8 cents per point.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.660]   Now if he wanted to go the same day direct, it was over 300,000 or 400,000 points, which
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.620]   was just not a good deal.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:23.060]   So the total for those two flights is 280,000 points and $350 per person.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.860]   Now relative to two $5,000 tickets, it actually seemed like a really good deal.
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.540]   It would have been an average of 3.4 cents per point.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.780]   But then I remembered something and asked him if he looked at multi-city flights or
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.100]   two one-ways.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.740]   Now he couldn't have booked a round trip because he wasn't actually going into and out of the
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.740]   same airport.
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.660]   He was doing what's called an open job, where you book from Seattle to London and then back
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.340]   from Paris.
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:51.320]   And funny enough, it really, really changed things.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.020]   But when you want to do that search, a lot of places can do it as a multi-city, where
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.300]   you can do that on Google Flights, you can do it anywhere.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.780]   And sure enough, if Bill bought that flight from Seattle to London and Paris back to Seattle,
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.340]   all in business class as one ticket, where the outbound was on Delta and the return was
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.860]   on Air France, which works well because they're partners, instead of $5,000 each way, it came
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.340]   down to $4,050 total.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.180]   So now I went back and said, "Oh, let's look at those options again."
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.620]   But keep in mind, those best options weren't even as ideal as the paid ticket because the
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.440]   return wasn't direct and he had to leave a day later.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.160]   It would have actually only been 1.32 cents per point, which means he would actually just
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.760]   be better off buying the $4,050 ticket in the Chase portal because with his Chase reserve,
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:44.480]   he'd get 1.5 cents per point to book in the portal, which he would only need 270,000 points
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.480]   to do.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.000]   Meanwhile, booking with points and miles and transferring to partners was going to cost
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.680]   280,000 points, which is more, plus $350 in taxes.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.680]   And that doesn't even take into account the fact that on those paid tickets, he'd actually
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.740]   be earning a lot of miles and points because he's buying a business class flight.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:08.020]   If he credited all those flights to Delta, and I know he has status, so he'd be getting
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.040]   nine points per dollar, so almost 36,000 points.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:16.080]   So you could actually factor that all into the calculation as well, and it brings the
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.640]   value to 1.17 cents per point.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.360]   So in this case, for him, the portal was actually a much better deal, that if he's always going
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:28.000]   to travel like this, meaning he has no flexibility on dates or destinations, only really wants
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.040]   to fly direct, he's probably better off stopping playing the points game and just focusing
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.320]   on cashback and burning all the points he has right now in the portal.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.840]   However, if he had another way to get outsized value from his points, he should just book
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:47.400]   this trip direct, pay out of pocket with dollars, and save his points for another day.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.760]   And while he agreed that travel isn't usually that flexible, he did point out that he thinks
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.560]   he's going to be able to get a lot of value transferring his points to Hyatt and booking
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.760]   a lot of hotels, and that value can often be in the 1.8 to 2 cents per point.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.080]   So for now, he's going to hold off on transferring his points, use them for Hyatt, and this is
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.320]   a trip he's just going to have to pay cash for.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.680]   Now, before I talk about our trip, I want to come back to the idea that booking international
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.040]   one-way flights, especially between the US and Europe, can be very suboptimal.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:21.520]   However, I want to flag an incredible way to save money if you ever need to do this.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.280]   For example, I looked at a flight from Seattle to Paris where the one-way business class
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:33.040]   ticket was $4,383, but if you booked that exact same $4,400 business class flight and
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:40.900]   added a return in economy a few weeks later, it came down to $2,465.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.000]   And if you just made that return go back to New York instead of Seattle, because that
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.600]   leg is even cheaper, the total came down to $2,250.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:54.480]   Now, I only checked one date, and I put it in the summer, and it came back to just one
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480]   airport.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.840]   It is very possible that if I went and looked at more dates and more airports, it could
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.800]   have gotten any cheaper to come back.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:09.520]   However, that took the price of the exact same $4,400 flight down to $2,250, meaning
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.800]   saving almost 50% of the cost.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.200]   And it's not just true for business class.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:20.920]   I looked on economy and a one-way flight, same dates from Seattle to Paris, that flight
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:27.520]   was $928 in economy for a one-way ticket, but if I made it a round trip coming back
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.520]   to New York, it brought the round trip price down to $691.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.800]   So by adding a round trip leg, even if you're never going to take it, you would have saved
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.440]   on that economy ticket $237 or 26%.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.360]   Now, if you want to take it even one step further and get more, once you've flown that
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.720]   first leg, you can cancel the return flight.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.840]   Now, you're not going to usually get the fare back at all, not even as a credit, because
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.480]   you've started your trip, but most airlines are still required to give you back the taxes
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:03.320]   and fees if you cancel that leg, which in this case was actually $107.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.760]   So that adds to the savings as well, and that was true even for economy, bringing that economy
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.760]   flight back after the refund to under $600.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.240]   So two big takeaways.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:20.160]   If you need to book a paid one-way flight between regions, especially the US to Europe,
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.560]   it can be way cheaper to add a throwaway leg to make it a round trip.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.040]   And the extra bonus is if you're trying to do it in business class, make the return leg
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   in economy.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.440]   Now, you can't do this the other way around, because if you miss your first flight, your
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.160]   second flight will get canceled.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.120]   And second, it doesn't make sense to compare the miles you need for two one-way award tickets
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:47.080]   to two one-way paid tickets if you can book those flights as multi-cities or using the
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.920]   trick we just talked about for way, way less.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.600]   So hopefully that's helpful for anyone either traveling on one-ways or thinking about booking
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.160]   flights in business.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.760]   So I first want to tell you a story about summer travel.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.460]   As for our situation, now that our oldest daughter is going to school, it turns out
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.940]   as any parent knows, except us, because we're just entering this, the travel window just
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.380]   gets really narrow.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.280]   It was obvious as we thought about it, but we never really processed the fact that once
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:19.280]   you have young kids that are in school, now you are forced to travel during summer, Christmas,
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.760]   Thanksgiving, New Year's, and spring break, maybe a winter break if you have that as well.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.160]   Otherwise, you're pulling your kids out of school.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.040]   So we decided we wanted to take a trip somewhere this summer.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.520]   And when it comes to weather and young kids, it seems like the best option for late summer
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.040]   is somewhere in Europe.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.320]   As it turns out, lots of people want to go to Europe in the summer, and we're going to
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.040]   be looking for four to five business class seats, depending on whether we bring our au pair.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.060]   And so I thought I'd share about how I approach that search, because it's a little different
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.400]   than other times.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.760]   For starters, I'm not even thinking about our final destination, whatever that may be,
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.280]   because we don't even know what it is.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.380]   Instead, I am just looking for a flight directly from San Francisco to Europe over a large
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.320]   travel window that we can go.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:08.480]   And I've been checking for five, 10 minutes every few days, but I actually found the flight
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.760]   we booked on PointsYaz Daydream Explorer tool, which if you aren't familiar, go back and
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.560]   listen to my episode a few weeks ago with Greg from The Frequent Miler.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:23.240]   But I put in US/Europe with a window, I put four seats, and sure enough, I found a flight
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.960]   on one particular day that was cheaper than every single other day, and that was from
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:33.680]   San Francisco to Paris, and it was only 45,000 points, plus $200 per person.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.040]   Now, since we don't have a destination in mind, it's really hard to compare that to
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.640]   what the cash price would be, but given what I just learned from helping Bill, it seemed
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.180]   like about $2,000 might be fair.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.160]   Compared to $2,000, 45,000 points.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.240]   Now, keep in mind, we probably aren't actually going to end up in Paris.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.940]   We went there a few years ago, but because it's a direct flight to Europe, during dates
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:59.000]   that work for us, that lands early enough that we could easily hop on another cheap
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.160]   intra-Europe flight or train, we decided to book it.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.640]   And a few considerations when you're doing one of these bookings, which is, I'll say,
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.840]   a little speculative.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.880]   One, I was concerned that had I known where we wanted to go, I could have added that connecting
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:19.200]   leg on without paying any more miles, but just to set aside that concern, I ended up
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.880]   searching for those same flights with flights to all over Europe.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:29.180]   Search Scandinavia, Rome, Portugal, Spain, everything, and every time it almost doubled
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:34.400]   the price, so I wasn't too worried, and when I was looking at all those intra-Europe flights,
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.880]   they were all less than 10,000 points in economy, availability was pretty good, and even if
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.640]   we had to pay cash, they were a couple hundred dollars, so I wasn't really worried about
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.120]   that aspect of it.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.520]   Also, I did consider that we might find something better later, which brings up questions about
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:53.600]   the cost to cancel if you do something kind of speculative, and that's where the airline
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.720]   you book with actually matters.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:01.400]   So in the case of Air France, I had to transfer those miles from Amex, which is irreversible.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:06.600]   So if I want to change plans, and those plans aren't on Air France, I'm stuck with a balance
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.120]   of Air France points.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.840]   So I have consistently found great Air France deals in the past, and it's pretty easy to
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:20.400]   prevent your miles from expiring, and so I'm okay leaving those points and miles in Air
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.720]   France if we decide to change things, but another important thing is that I also have
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.720]   enough points in Amex and Chase that I can use somewhere else, so it's not going to be
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.000]   too restrictive.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.280]   However, also important is the cancellation cost.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:39.160]   Many U.S. airlines will let you cancel and redeposit your miles for free, which is awesome,
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.040]   but a lot of the international airlines don't.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.920]   So for Air France, you pay 70 euro per person to cancel, so in this case, if we found something
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.840]   better or decided not to take this trip, we'd be out 350 euro, which would suck, but it's
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.480]   nowhere near as bad as some others, which can be $200 per person.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.100]   I'll link to a frequent miler article in the show notes that covers all the award cancel
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.080]   and change policies for every airline.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.320]   As for coming home, we actually don't have a return trip, and that's something that in
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.480]   Wednesday's episode this week, I'm going to talk a lot about with Nick from The Frequent
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.080]   Miler also, and it's just such a great conversation.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.080]   You are going to love it.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.360]   We are going to talk about how to focus on getting the most value from your points and
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.880]   miles and ways to think about planning an entire trip, so stay tuned for that in two
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.880]   days.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.480]   But coming back to it, we actually did find a return trip that could work, and it was
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.360]   a pretty good deal, 63,000 points, but it was on Swiss Air from Vienna to Zurich to
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   San Francisco.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.700]   Now, knowing we have no plans to end up in Vienna and that we have to book through Avianca,
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:42.440]   which was a $200 per person cancellation fee, I felt like it wasn't as likely to work as
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.720]   the other one, and we passed on it.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.440]   Now, funny enough, if we could have just booked that direct Zurich flight instead of have
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.400]   to start in Vienna, I probably would have done it, but for some reason, that flight
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.680]   just didn't show up.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:59.580]   If you wanted to book directly Zurich to San Francisco, it was like three times the price
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:04.160]   as booking Vienna to Zurich to San Francisco on the same flight, so that's just one of
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:09.040]   the nuances of miles and points and why having to use a lot of these new tools to do searching
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.360]   can be super valuable.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.560]   Once we get everything booked, I will make sure to share all my learnings, and when we
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.860]   get back from the trip, I will definitely share my takeaways.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.120]   Two more things that I quickly want to talk about.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.000]   First is about teaching our three-year-old daughter how to read.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.200]   Now, this wasn't something really on our minds at all until I saw this tweet go viral a few
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:35.160]   months ago about an app called Mentava that helps teach kids to read at really young ages,
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.320]   as early as two or three.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.360]   Our daughter has been interested in letters and numbers, but we never really thought about
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.520]   trying to teach her to read yet, but I love technology, so it seemed like a great time
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:52.240]   to give it a consideration, so I signed up for the wait list and soon got an invitation.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.840]   Without much context, the initial price of this app gave me a bit of sticker shock.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.320]   It was $500 a month.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.200]   Initially, that seemed really high, but in comparison to a private tutor, which would
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:10.720]   be $1,000 a month, or even private school at $2,000 to $3,000 a month, you could probably
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.540]   make an argument that this is a much better deal.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:19.160]   Either way, it had a 30-day money-back guarantee, so I thought, "Why not give it a try?"
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.800]   About two weeks in, I was absolutely blown away.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.400]   My daughter was actually reading four-letter words on her own, and all I could think about
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.080]   was what did I get myself into?
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:35.240]   The CEO of Mentava, Niels, has been posting a lot of interesting stuff online.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.080]   He shared that the 30-day refund rate was way lower than expected, and they've seen
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.420]   a much higher renewal rate, which probably tracks with the experience that we're seeing
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.160]   of how well this works.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:50.760]   Also, any time someone criticized the price online, he just offered up the advice of this
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:56.160]   incredible book for less than $20 that can help kids have a similar outcome.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.240]   It's called "Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons."
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:04.560]   Naturally, I bought that book as well, and am trying to at least do my best comparison
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.200]   before the 30-day window is up.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.800]   But having done a couple of lessons from the book, it really feels like Mentava wins on
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:17.240]   at least convenience and engagement, especially if my daughter had a vote, but that obviously
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.680]   comes at a cost.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.440]   Quick aside, that also made me wonder, are there other apps or companies that could be
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.500]   built to take other types of learning and make them more convenient?
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:32.000]   So if you have that same idea and you're curious, definitely check out Greg Eisenberg's "The
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.600]   Startup Ideas" pod, because I joined him a couple weeks ago to talk about that exact
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   topic.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.760]   Now, just to clarify and be extra transparent, Mentava is not a sponsor of this show.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.960]   At all.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.680]   There was zero consideration given from Mentava, as much as I would absolutely love to get
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   a free subscription.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.040]   That was not offered to me, at least not yet.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.680]   Niels, if you're listening, you have my email.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.360]   But they did offer a $50 discount with the code ALLTHEHACKS to anyone who wants to give
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.520]   it a try for a month.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.640]   I will just give you the same warning I gave my sister and wish I got myself.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.500]   Don't try it unless you're actually willing to continue, because there is something so
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.320]   magical about seeing your child starting to learn to read.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.480]   Next thing I probably need to do is some research on whether early reading actually has any
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.760]   impact on educational success or anything like that, so stay tuned.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.440]   Finally, I want to give an update on the charity water fundraiser we did last year.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:29.320]   We hit our goal of raising $20,000, which was $15,000 from all of you, and we ended
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:35.820]   up matching the first $5,000, which means we will be able to fully fund two water projects.
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.240]   Thank you so much to everyone who contributed.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:43.680]   A special thank you to the five people who contributed $1,000 or more, Christian, Richard,
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:51.280]   the Greger family, Court, and a huge thank you to Kylie for the final $2,421 that got
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:57.520]   us to our $20,000 goal, which was on top of another contribution she had already made.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.200]   I will keep everyone posted if we get updates from Charity Water about the progress of the
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.640]   water projects we're building.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.220]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.720]   If you have any thoughts or feedback about this Monday Musings episode, please let me
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   know.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:17.360]   You can tag me on Twitter or Instagram, you can send a DM or email, podcast@allthehacks.com,
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:21.040]   or if you really want to speak my love language right now, it would be through a five-star
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.480]   review on Apple Podcasts.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.480]   Thank you so much.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.240]   I will see everyone on Wednesday.
