[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   So actually people who have so little alcohol dehydrogenase
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.020]   that when they ingest alcohol,
[00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.780]   they get very red and they just feel sick.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.260]   So if you're somebody that has a sip of alcohol
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.500]   and you just feel horrible, it makes you feel nauseous,
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.900]   chances are you have gene variants
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.900]   that create a situation where you're not making
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.700]   very much alcohol dehydrogenase,
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.780]   you just simply can't metabolize alcohol.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.300]   So you just get a rapid buildup
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.340]   of the toxic effects of alcohol, the acetyl aldehyde.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.540]   You're not converting it into those empty calories.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.340]   In cultures where you have a lot of genetic variants
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.180]   and genes expressed in people
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.280]   where they have a lot of alcohol dehydrogenase,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.980]   sure, they can drink more
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.620]   and they're converting more of that alcohol
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.180]   from its toxic form to a non-toxic form.
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.020]   And yes, of course, you will observe more alcoholism
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.140]   in those communities because they're drinking more.
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.180]   But I do wanna emphasize that the environmental factors
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.580]   are playing a strong role there too,
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.980]   because if you can drink more, you're likely to drink more.
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.960]   If you're somebody that feels sick immediately
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.780]   from drinking, it's likely that you're not gonna engage
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.300]   in alcohol consumption,
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.580]   especially if these things are genetically related
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.740]   and of course, genes and culture and location
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.740]   in the world tend to run together.
