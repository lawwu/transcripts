[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.640]   the Gospel according to St. John in the third chapter and the eighth verse.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.920]   The eighth verse in the third chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.560]   The wind bloweth where it lifteth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:33.360]   whence it cometh and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.320]   We are still considering this great and momentous statement and we are doing so because it is
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.600]   obviously clearly the whole basis of the Christian life.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.560]   I keep on reminding you of the setting of this statement because if we forget that we
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.080]   should really miss the import of the statement.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.320]   What is so vital is that we should remember the men to whom the statement was made, Nicodemus,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.960]   this master of Israel, this religious godly man, this instructor of the Jews in the way
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.240]   of righteousness as he and the Pharisees understood it.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.140]   And it was to him that our Lord uttered these words when he came to him at night seeking
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.180]   that interview with him and anxious obviously to discover what was this something extra
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.040]   that our Lord had been possessed over and above what he had.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.040]   And here is the statement.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.320]   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again."
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.800]   He cannot see the kingdom of God.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.720]   He will learn to enter it, but he cannot even see it.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.000]   The whole thing is entirely different.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.240]   In other words, Nicodemus is taught here that he has to understand that this new life which
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.920]   the Son of God has come to bring into this world is indeed entirely new.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.200]   It is to be born of the Spirit.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.880]   It is to be made a partaker of the divine nature.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.040]   Now here, I say, is a great lesson for all and especially for those who, like Nicodemus,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.160]   have been brought up in a religious manner.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   There is no question.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.920]   The New Testament itself reveals this and the subsequent history of the Church ever
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.520]   since reveals it and perhaps never more so than today.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.880]   But ultimately the greatest enemy of the Christian faith is religion.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.960]   There is no question about this.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.000]   It happened in the time of our Lord, you remember, that the publicans and the harlots went into
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.200]   the kingdom of God before the Pharisees and the scribes.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.280]   That is the terrible thing that is depicted in the pages of the four Gospels.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.680]   And I say that has been the case ever since.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.000]   And so there is nothing more vital for us to realize than just this very thing, that
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.120]   the Christian life, the Christian faith, is not something that we add on to what we have.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.320]   It is something that is done to us.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.040]   We need to be born again.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.240]   It is a mighty operation of the Spirit of God.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.520]   And it is nothing less than giving us new life, a new disposition, a new nature, a new
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.520]   heart.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.800]   These are the terms that are used.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.080]   A man becomes a new creature, a new creation.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.920]   That is Christianity and nothing less than that.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.640]   And therefore, what we are doing is this.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.160]   We are trying to discover whether this is true of us.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.080]   And the way to do that, of course, is to discover the characteristics of this new life which
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.480]   is in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.280]   And it is so vital and so urgently important that we are going through it at our leisure,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   looking at different aspects.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.600]   Now, we have done a great deal already.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.800]   We have seen that obviously this is the most outstanding thing about anybody who has received
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   it.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.840]   You cannot receive life from God without its being evident.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.600]   It is the life of God in the soul.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.880]   And therefore, it is more obvious about us than anything else that may be true of us.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.320]   And we have looked at many, many other characteristics.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.080]   Now last Sunday we were dealing in particular with this, that when a man receives this new
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.040]   life, it changes his attitude completely towards the world.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.080]   He no longer loves the world.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.480]   He may be still attracted and enticed by certain aspects and at certain times, but he no longer
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   loves it.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.200]   Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.680]   The lust of the flesh and the lust of the eye and the pride of life, they are the things
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.600]   that belong to the world.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.880]   But they are not the things that belong to God.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.280]   Or the Apostle Paul puts it in writing to the Romans, that the carnal men he minds,
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.920]   is attracted by, is interested in, engrossed in carnal things, the things of the flesh.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:17.520]   But he is of the spirit mind, is interested in, is absorbed by the things of the spirit.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.200]   And this is a tremendous test.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.920]   And we saw together how it works out in practice.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.760]   These are not things that you have to do yourself, you just find that you are different.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.680]   This new nature has changed you.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.480]   And therefore your instinctive reaction to things becomes different.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.600]   And we ended by pointing out how this happens even in one's view of oneself and of one's
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.800]   life in this world.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.840]   Once a man gets this new life, he sees himself as he's never seen himself before.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.920]   And he hates what he sees.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.680]   He doesn't love his life in this world any longer, nor himself.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.280]   Very well.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.080]   But that was more or less negative, and we must proceed now to look at that self-sentient
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.240]   thing in its positive aspect.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   And this is important.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.400]   It's important that we should look at it positively as well as negatively, in order
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.160]   to make it comprehensive we are doing both.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.360]   And let me remind you of this.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.560]   I am not saying that we must be satisfied that we have all these manifestations of this
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.600]   life completely or perfectly.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.840]   Nobody has that.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.720]   If we were to set that up as the standard, well then we might well come to the conclusion
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.440]   that there is no one who is a Christian at all.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.000]   All I am saying is this, that there is evidence of this kind of thing.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   That this is there.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It's essentially there.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.120]   It's all in this seed of life.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:53.200]   But of course there is to be growth and development and enlargement as we go on in our study of
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.240]   these things and our understanding of them, and as we grow in grace and in the knowledge
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.340]   of the Lord.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.600]   So now I come to this test which is a love of righteousness.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:14.480]   Now here you see is again one of those tests which differentiates so clearly between the
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.700]   cults and their teaching, and especially religion.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.980]   This is the great and the vital contrast.
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.760]   It may be strange that one is saying all this about religion at a time like this.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.960]   There are not many religious people left in this country.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.720]   But I have this terrible feeling, and I have it increasingly.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.960]   It's a terrible thing to have to say my friends, but I think we've got to face this.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:47.080]   Is it I wonder the case that the main obstacle to the people who are outside the church today
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.360]   is very often the people who are inside the church.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.280]   This is the thing that's so clear in the scriptures, and as I say has been clear ever since then.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.720]   That it is the false within the church.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.140]   Now we saw it in the previous chapter when our Lord cleansed the temple.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.400]   And all the great histories of reformations and revivals, they illustrate the same thing.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.920]   The church herself has been the problem.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.920]   Why?
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.240]   Because she has lost her Christianity and has just become a religious institution.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:25.880]   And there are so many evidences which suggest that that is the case today.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:32.680]   That we've got to get this clear, the difference between religion and Christianity.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:39.720]   Nothing is of any value except this true Christian faith, this new life that comes from God into
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.720]   the soul.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.640]   And therefore I say this is a particularly valuable test at this point.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.760]   Because religion is always concerned with morality only.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.080]   It is concerned with morality of course.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.040]   It is its only concern.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.920]   Religion is concerned with behavior.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.560]   It's much more concerned with a man's behavior than it is with a man himself.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.440]   And that's why it's finally useless.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.360]   Religion looks at a man on the outside and as long as he looks fairly good and clean
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.120]   and respectable, it's very satisfied with him.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.560]   But it doesn't look at the inside.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.960]   That's how our Lord put it, you remember, in speaking to the Pharisees one day, "Ye
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.120]   are they," he said, "that may clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but your
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.680]   inward parts are full of ravening and wickedness."
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.560]   Religion puts up a respectable appearance, but it's never really interested in the
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:46.640]   person as such, in the texture of the personality through and through.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.560]   It's only interested in behavior.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.680]   And I've always felt that that is the final charge against morality, that it really insults
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.000]   us by telling us that what we do is more important than what we are.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.760]   That's a terrible insult.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.240]   But you see, that governs not only religion, but it governs so much of life and of behavior,
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   doesn't it?
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.400]   It's the outward show, the outward appearance.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:20.040]   And inside there are horrors, but your cults and your religion and your social curves and
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.800]   agreements are not interested in that.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.920]   It's all the appearance, what's it look like?
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.960]   The man himself is more or less forgotten.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.240]   In other words, morality is entirely negative.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.080]   It's simply concerned about the absence of certain things.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:44.520]   As long as the man is not a drunkard, or not a murderer, not an adulterer, morality and
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.520]   religion are very pleased with him.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.920]   He's doing very well.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.440]   You see, the outlook is entirely negative, and interested only in the absence of certain
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.440]   things.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.760]   Religion is the enemy of this glorious truth which we have here in the New Testament, because
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.400]   this is essentially positive, and that's its glory.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:12.800]   Now, our Lord himself put this for us in one of his Beatitudes.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:20.960]   "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness."
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.320]   You see, the positive character of this.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:28.160]   "They are not blessed who merely are concerned not to do this and that."
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.160]   That was the Pharisee.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.640]   "Tithing mint and rue and anise and cumming, but forgetting the weightier matters of the
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.600]   law, love and justice and righteousness and so on."
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.800]   You see, there it is.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   That's the contrast.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:50.000]   But the man who is truly blessed, the Christian man, is the man who hungers and thirsts after
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.320]   righteousness.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.280]   He wants this thing positively.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:59.800]   Or, if you like, the Apostle Paul puts the same thing in his epistle to the Romans in
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.760]   chapter 14 and verse 17.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:11.280]   He says, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.840]   in the Holy Ghost."
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:19.240]   You see, the difficulty was certain people in Rome, even members of the Church, being
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.520]   tempted by the devil and false teaching had been coming in, and they were becoming a little
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   bit legalistic.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.600]   And there was a great argument going on in the Church as to which day you should observe
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.920]   as the Sabbath and so on, whether you should observe the seventh day or the first.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.560]   This kind of legalism.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.040]   And then about meats, what meat should you eat and so on.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.680]   And the whole of the Church of Rome seemed to have been arguing about this.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.200]   And that's how the Apostle finally puts it to them.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.800]   "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink."
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.400]   That isn't what decides whether you're a Christian or not.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.160]   That you don't eat certain meats and you don't drink certain drinks, that doesn't make a
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.440]   man a Christian.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.480]   It can make him a religious man, it can make him a moral man.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.040]   He doesn't drink, he doesn't get drunk, he doesn't do this and that, therefore he's all
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   right.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   But he isn't.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:15.880]   "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, and mere correctness in certain external matters
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.360]   of conduct and behavior."
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.880]   That's included, but you see, that's as it were just the introduction to it.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.120]   No, no, it's righteousness, positive righteousness.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.160]   "Peace and joy in the Holy Ghost."
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:39.640]   Well now, I'm taking up this whole statement as it's put there by our Lord and by the Apostle.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.240]   So we can sum it up by saying this.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:48.000]   The man who is merely religious is a man who's concerned about not doing certain things,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.200]   and then he's satisfied.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.680]   But the man who is truly Christian, the man who has this life of God in his soul, is a
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.800]   man who has a great desire and longing to be holy.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   Positively to be holy.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.800]   Hungers and thirsts after righteousness.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.000]   Well now, how does this work itself out?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.960]   How can we test ourselves in detail?
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:17.000]   There it is in principle, but to be practical, how do we apply that to ourselves and to our
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   condition?
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.760]   Well there are many things which are told us here in the Scriptures.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:27.600]   Let me give you one which is put by the Apostle John in the first epistle, chapter 5, and
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.560]   in the first three verses.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:36.520]   "Whosoever," he says, "believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.800]   And every one that loveth him that beget loveth him also that is begotten of him."
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.640]   By this we know that we love the children of God.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.760]   When we love God and keep his commandments.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:56.240]   But then, "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.440]   And his commandments are not grievous."
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.440]   That's it.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.800]   That's our first test.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.480]   The commandments are not grievous.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.200]   So John is there, you see, describing this man that is born of God.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.440]   And he says to this man that the commandments of God are not grievous.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.040]   The point is that they are grievous to everybody else.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.840]   And that's how we are able therefore to test ourselves.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.800]   Here in the New Testament you read about the Christian life, the characters of the Christian
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   life.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.560]   You get your great doctrine, you get then the appeal to work that out in practice, and
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.440]   you get your pictures and portrayals of the Christian men and how he lives.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.560]   Of course, what he doesn't do, but above all what he does do and what he's like.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.280]   And you find that there is a type of life depicted.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.840]   You see it in perfection in our Lord himself, but you see it in the apostles and in the
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.840]   early Christians and the saints.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.240]   Now this life, there it is.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.680]   And there are certain characteristics of that life.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.800]   Now here's the question.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.400]   What do we feel about that life?
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:15.760]   A Christian is a man who doesn't do certain things, as I say, but does other things also.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:22.520]   Now the whole test here is, what is our reaction to that?
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.640]   Do we feel that the Christian life is narrow?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.320]   Do we feel that it's against the grain?
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.800]   Do we wish that it were not like this?
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.520]   Now if we do, we are just saying that the commandments to us are grievous.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.800]   If we're always coming up against them, as it were, and starting back and being somewhat
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.080]   annoyed, if we use that term "narrow," it's a very bad sign when a man brings that term
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.800]   "narrow" in.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.080]   It tells us all about him, doesn't it?
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   And that's the point, you see.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.360]   The commandments to such a man are grievous.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.120]   And there are many people, the religious people in particular, always find the commandments
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.120]   of God grievous.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.600]   They're always there, and they're pulling them up, and they're having to readjust themselves,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.440]   and they're trying to make themselves conformable to this.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.000]   You see, the whole thing is outside them, and it's not inside them, so it's always
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   grievous.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.960]   It's a kind of yoke, as the apostle Peter put it in the Council at Jerusalem, you remember,
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:33.600]   that the old Jewish system was a yoke, that it was grievous to be born, and our forefathers,
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.520]   he said, have found that as we have found that.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.800]   Well, now there are people who find the Christian life to be like that.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.720]   They regard it as something that's against them.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.920]   They'd like to do so many things on Sundays and other days, but they can't because they're
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   Christian.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.920]   That's it.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.920]   It's something that pulls them up always.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.640]   It's a kind of stumbling block to them.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.640]   It becomes a law.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.640]   Now, that's not Christianity.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:18:04.240]   Law is always grievous, but this is not grievous because this is life, not law.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.900]   And therefore, this to me is a tremendous test.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.640]   If we have objections to the Christian life, and wish it wasn't like this, and wished
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.880]   it allowed this or that, if we're always up against it as if, it just means that it's
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.400]   grievous, the commandments are grievous.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.280]   And John says that to the men that is born of God and has this life of God in him, his
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.880]   commandments are not grievous.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:34.800]   Well, of course not, because he delights in the law of the Lord.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.920]   He hungers and thirsts after righteousness, so it can't be grievous to him.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.280]   You don't hunger and thirst after something which is grievous to you.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.080]   Or let me put it like this.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:52.640]   This man who has this life of God in him, who's born of God, is a man who instinctively,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:58.240]   because he is a child of God, is anxious to please his father.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:04.800]   He is aware of this relationship, and he feels this desire therefore to please God, who is
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.200]   his father, and to be well pleasing in his sight.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:15.120]   You see, as we've seen already in some of the other tests, the glory of this life is
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.760]   that it's always personal.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:25.640]   God is no longer merely only the law giver, he's become father.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.040]   We pray saying, "Our Father."
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.320]   And immediately you're in a new realm.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.960]   And you're no longer governed by rules and laws and regulations, but you're governed
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.000]   by this personal relationship.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.040]   That's the thing that calls for the conduct.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:48.000]   And as far as you are concerned, what you have within you is a desire to please him,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.560]   and to be well pleasing in his sight.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.240]   It's something inevitable, it's natural.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:58.840]   You see, that's why this thing is so important, that it is life, not taking on a point of
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.120]   view, not taking on a new code, not taking on a religion.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:10.200]   No, no, it's something put into you, and it inevitably leads to that result.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:15.480]   Or let's put it like this, and you see, this is where one sees the fascination of
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.480]   the scriptures.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.920]   It all works out in so many different ways, but comes to the same point.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:30.240]   A man who is born of God, a man who is truly Christian, is a man who comes to the realization
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:38.200]   that really the whole object of salvation, ultimately, is to make us righteous.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:45.840]   Now, when we first get to know these things, and perhaps partly because of the evangelistic
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:52.600]   form in which it's so commonly presented, we tend to think of salvation as almost exclusively
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:58.080]   forgiveness of sins, something that delivers us from the guilt and the condemnation and
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.520]   the punishment of sins.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.120]   We are forgiven, we are all right, we are saved.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.920]   All right, of course, it's there, but you know, that is not the real object of salvation.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.280]   That's not the ultimate object of salvation.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.840]   Well, what is it?
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:18.200]   Well, the Apostle Paul has put it, again, in a very memorable statement in his Epistle
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.040]   to Titus, in the second chapter, beginning at verse 11.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:28.200]   "For the grace of God," he says, "that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   us."
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   Well, what does it teach us?
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:37.720]   Well, he says, "teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts," you see, that's the negative
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.680]   that we were dealing with last Sunday.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:47.640]   You start with that, "denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:55.320]   righteously, and godly in this present world, looking for that blessed hope and the glorious
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us."
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.320]   Why?
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:11.800]   "Well, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.600]   zealous of good works."
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.880]   That's it.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.360]   That's the characteristic of his people, the people for his own possession, a people who
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:28.200]   are redeemed not only from the guilt and the punishment of their sin, but from iniquity,
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:36.840]   and purified unto him as a people who are zealous of good works.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.880]   Now, that, you see, as the apostle puts it there, and it's not the only statement by
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:47.400]   any means to that effect, that is the ultimate object of salvation.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.960]   And of course it must be for this reason.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:01.320]   God made men in his own image, and that meant that men was originally righteous.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.000]   You see, we all unconsciously tend to absorb these pernicious teachings, evolution and
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   so on, that men was once an animal and then he became a man after this long process and
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.400]   gradually developed a moral sense.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.800]   It insinuates itself into our thinking, but it's all wrong, it's a complete contradiction
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.080]   of the scriptures.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.800]   Man was created perfect, righteous.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:29.520]   Obviously, God is righteous, and if he puts something of his own image on men, which he
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.720]   did, for men was created in the image and likeness of God, men was endowed with this
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.960]   original righteousness.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.560]   And salvation is that which brings a man back to that.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:48.360]   Men in his rebellion and disobedience not only broke commandments, he lost his righteousness,
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.960]   he lost his love of righteousness.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.640]   We're all born lovers of sin and of evil, we're all born in a lawless manner, there
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:01.240]   is no question about that, we're all against God and against God's early law, and that
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.960]   is why we need the new birth.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.640]   And so, you see, the man who has this life in him very soon comes to see that he doesn't
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.120]   stop at his forgiveness, he doesn't say, "I'm safe now, I can do what I like now, the blood
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.600]   of Christ, I've only got to plead that, then I'm alright," so he goes on sinning, repents,
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:26.480]   sins, repents, blood of Christ cleanses, no, no, he doesn't do that, he can't do that.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.800]   That's a man who makes merchandise of the blood of Christ, as the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.760]   puts it, but not so the Christian.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:39.640]   The true Christian is a man who realizes that all that has been done in Christ has been
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.160]   done in order to make us positively righteous.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:50.000]   The peculiar people, zealous of good works.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   You see, I'll take again the apostle, putting it in 2 Corinthians 5 21, "He hath made him
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.960]   to be sin for us who knew no sin."
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.960]   What for?
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:05.120]   Well, here's the answer, "That we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.240]   Or take it again in Romans 8 3 and 4, "God sent forth his Son what the law could not
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.160]   do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.840]   sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh."
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.840]   Why?
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.760]   Oh well, "In order that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.360]   not after the flesh but after the Spirit."
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.280]   You see, it's the whole teaching of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280]   Righteousness.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   Why did Christ die?
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.120]   He did it in order that I might be made righteous.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.240]   He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.440]   He died to make us good, positively good.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.920]   And if we leave that out, we've not really understood the ultimate object and objective
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.800]   of our great and glorious salvation.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.880]   Therefore let's take it even a step further.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:10.040]   Surely a man cannot have long been in this life or have this life in him without realizing
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:17.280]   that righteousness is clearly the basis of our communion with God.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.240]   Now here you see is something which is of vital importance and I hope to develop it
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.120]   on another Sunday morning in and of itself.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.360]   I hope to devote a whole morning to it.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.760]   But let me put it like this just now.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.520]   The Christian is a man who, again I say, is conscious that what really matters is this
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.080]   personal relationship.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.800]   In other words, the object of this new life is not merely to deliver me from hell, it
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.040]   is not only to make me righteous.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.040]   Why should I be made righteous?
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   There's only one answer.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:58.720]   I should become righteous in order that I may have communion with God.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.800]   In the original creation, men had a constant communion with God.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.640]   God had made him in this way in order that men might be his companion.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.640]   And there was fellowship and communion between God and men.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.400]   And the basis of that, of course, was righteousness.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.040]   But we've lost that through sin and that is why men, as he is by nature, doesn't know
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.040]   God.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.080]   And the God he thinks he believes in is no God.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.080]   It's the creature of his own creation.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.920]   But when a man becomes truly Christian, he realizes, I say, that the ultimate object
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.600]   of it all was to bring him back to communion with God.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.880]   Now, this is the constant teaching of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.000]   You see, we have become so legalistic in our outlook.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.080]   We will persist in thinking of it just in terms of forgiveness and being put right with
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.880]   the law and so on, and we leave it at that.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.640]   But you know, the ultimate object is to bring us back into fellowship and communion with
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   God.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:09.080]   Listen to Peter putting it, "For Christ also once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust,
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:13.880]   that he might bring us to God."
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.000]   That's the meaning of the word "reconciliation."
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.760]   It doesn't mean that you're merely reconciled in terms of law.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:27.520]   It means that you are restored to fellowship, to communion, to a knowledge of God.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.600]   We must get rid of this merely legalistic aspect.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.920]   It is there and you've got to start with it, but it doesn't stop there.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:41.120]   This is the thing which the whole salvation is intended to produce, is that we are brought
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:48.600]   back into this condition and relationship in which we know God and know him as our Father.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:55.640]   Let me quote it again, John 17, 3, "This is life eternal, that we might know thee,
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.080]   the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent."
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:06.480]   Not know about him, we've got that, but to know him with an element of intimacy, very
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.880]   prominent in that.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.560]   Now, here is something you see, which therefore obviously becomes true of the man who's
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.840]   got this new life from God in his soul.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.720]   He's got this new nature and it's a righteous one.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.800]   And this is something that is seeking communion with God.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:29.880]   But as Amos had put it in the Old Testament, "Can two walk together except they be agreed?"
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.880]   You can't.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.880]   It's impossible.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:38.760]   Two can't really walk together in fellowship and in communion except or unless they be
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   agreed.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:48.800]   Or if you like it in still more logical form, the form of an argument put by the apostle
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.280]   in 2 Corinthians 6.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.160]   Here it is.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:59.120]   He's putting this question to these Corinthians and he winds it up by saying, "Be not unequally
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.960]   yoked together with unbelievers."
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   Why?
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:08.400]   You see, we've already seen that there is an essential separation.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.120]   The sword has come down, dividing a man even from his father or from his mother and so
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.120]   on.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.480]   The sword, there is a division.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.400]   And yet because of the weakness we are still in in the flesh and because of the devil and
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:27.200]   his inducements and enticements, we are foolish enough at times to try and keep up this communication
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.760]   between us and the life out of which we've been brought and from which we've been separated.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.040]   So he says, "Don't be unequally yoked together with unbelievers."
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.040]   Why not?
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.040]   Well, he says, "If you are, you're contradicting the very thing that's happened to you.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:44.720]   You're showing a failure to understand that you have received new life from God."
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:53.360]   For what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness?
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.000]   There is really none at all.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.160]   You can't mix these things.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:02.440]   Righteousness and unrighteousness are eternal opposites by definition.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.040]   Their whole nature is different.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.720]   Their whole character is different.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.200]   You can't mix righteousness and unrighteousness.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   And there is really no fellowship between righteousness and unrighteousness.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.000]   Or, he says, "What communion hath light with darkness?"
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   None at all.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.360]   They're all together different and separate.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:29.120]   "What concordeth Christ with Belial, or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.400]   What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?"
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.840]   And the answer is, you see, in all these cases, none whatsoever.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:45.360]   So the man who's got this new life in him, he realizes that righteousness is the very
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.960]   basis of communion with God.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.320]   And as that is the thing that he desires above everything else, the commandments of God are
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   not grievous.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.480]   No, no, they're the things that point him to the way of communion, lead him to the fellowship
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.720]   that he desires.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:05.840]   He cannot go on doing the things he's been doing and still say that he seeks fellowship
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.840]   with God.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:13.760]   Well, let John say that for us in his own amazing and almost startling manner.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:19.400]   This then is the message that we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light,
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.880]   and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:31.160]   If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.240]   truth.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.960]   But in the next chapter, the second chapter of that first epistle, he puts it still stronger
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:41.520]   when he says this, "Hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:49.960]   He that says, 'I know him and keepeth not his commandments,' is a liar, and the truth
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.360]   is not in him."
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.640]   And that's all that's to be said of him.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   He's a liar.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:01.180]   A man who claims to be a Christian and yet is all together against the things that this
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:06.360]   great salvation has come in to produce, he's just a liar.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.120]   He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.000]   He's contradicting himself and he's misleading others.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   The thing is inevitable.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.200]   There's no need to argue about it at all.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:23.560]   As God is righteous, the man who desires communion with him obviously is a seeker after righteousness
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:29.040]   in order that he may enjoy the fellowship and the communion.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:36.360]   So I can put it like this, that this new nature that we've been given, this new life of God,
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:45.600]   because it is life from God, it creates within us a desire to be like him.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:51.960]   And not only now that we may enjoy the communion, but because we know that that is his nature
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:57.000]   and that we are meant to be like that because we were created in his image and likeness,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.560]   we desire to be like him.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.640]   Therefore we see the point of that statement that goes running through the whole Bible
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:11.560]   in different places, "Be ye holy for I am holy," saith the Lord.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:17.360]   Be ye holy for I am holy.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:23.720]   And this man is a man who feels this new holy nature that is within him.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.260]   This is an incorruptible seed.
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.960]   This is a pure seed.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:35.440]   You remember Peter again stresses that very point when he reminds these Christian people
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.120]   of this very thing.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:44.000]   "Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit and to unfeigned
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.960]   love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently, being
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.440]   born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of God which liveth
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.240]   and abideth forever."
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:07.840]   It is an incorruptible seed and as it grows and develops it creates within us this desire
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:14.900]   for incorruptibility, for righteousness, for positive holiness, to be like the sons of
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:21.200]   God that we were meant to be, that we may glorify our Father which is in heaven.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:27.320]   Even so I put it finally in this form, and this is perhaps the ultimate test that we
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:32.160]   must apply to ourselves in this matter.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:40.400]   Is our desire for righteousness and holiness greater than our idea for happiness, greater
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:45.360]   than our desire for experiences?
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.040]   Now I have to put it like that because of the subtlety of the devil.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.880]   The devil is an angel of light when he has failed to keep us from taking any interest
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.320]   in these matters, will come as our would-be friend, as an angel of light, and he will
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.680]   quote the scriptures.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.880]   And he will say to us now the thing above everything else that you want of course is
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:10.800]   happiness and he'll put our eye on happiness.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800]   But we mustn't.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:16.960]   You notice the beatitude which I quoted just now.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.520]   "Blessed are they, happy are they.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.280]   Oh yes they are very happy people, they alone really are happy.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.280]   But who are they?
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.640]   Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after happiness.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:32.960]   No, blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.480]   That's the whole secret.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.160]   It's a subtle point and yet it's a very important one and a man knows it at once.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:44.640]   Are we really concerned to be happy or are we concerned to be holy?
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.040]   Is righteousness the thing we are seeking or is it merely happiness?
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.400]   So I put it in terms of experience.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:55.040]   The devil you see comes and he tells us, "Ah well of course you're quite right.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.720]   You go in for this and you'll have the most thrilling, marvellous experiences.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.000]   And your whole attention is on the experiences and the thrills and the feelings and the excitements
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and so on.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.920]   All right, there are great experiences in the Christian life.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.360]   All I'm saying is this.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.840]   Which comes first with you?
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.200]   Righteousness and holiness or experiences?
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:28.040]   There is no more urgently vital test that we can apply to ourselves than just that.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:35.760]   The proof of the life of God in the soul is that a man says, "Though he slay me, yet
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.760]   will I love him.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.880]   I don't care what happens to me.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.440]   If all goes wrong with me, it doesn't matter.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.960]   I still desire him above everything else."
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.960]   That's the test.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:52.360]   A desire, a hunger and thirst after righteousness greater than anything else, above everything
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.360]   else.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.080]   Everything else has to take second place to this.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:02.600]   If you can say that with confidence, that you are hungering and thirsting after righteousness
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   beyond everything else in the world, my dear friend, you've got the life of God in you.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:16.360]   For no man ever is in that position except the man who has been born of the Spirit, who
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.360]   has been born of God.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.880]   Well, there it is.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.400]   There is a great and a vital test.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.400]   Let me supplement that by putting it in this way.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:29.320]   It's virtually the same thing, but it makes it yet more positive.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:35.160]   I'm suggesting that another whole group of tests, if you like, is that this man shows
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:41.360]   evidences of the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.880]   That's it.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:52.040]   The man who has the life of God in him is going to show some of the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:57.440]   I read that section from Galatians 5 at the beginning in order that we might concentrate
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.120]   our attention on this.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.920]   You get exactly the same thing, really, in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.600]   "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, chariot, I am
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.840]   become ascending breasts, a tinkling cymbal."
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.200]   It's this quality of life.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.440]   It's this love.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.280]   And here it is in Galatians 5, in those 22nd and 23rd verses.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.800]   Now, the principle is again the thing that is of first importance to us here.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.440]   You notice that it is called the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.320]   Now, you can't manufacture fruit.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.160]   You can't manufacture fruit.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.480]   You can manufacture things that look remarkably like fruit, and make you look the second time
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.760]   to make sure that they're not, whether they're real or artificial, but it's not fruit.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:55.520]   With all his cleverness today, and men is very clever, he can't make life, he can't
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.840]   make fruit.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.440]   No, no, you can't do it.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.280]   Fruit is never manufactured.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.920]   You can't add on fruit.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.560]   Fruit isn't added on to the branches of a tree.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.480]   Fruit is something that comes out from within.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.120]   Fruit is a manifestation of life.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   Fruit is a manifestation of nature.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.680]   It's in, and that which is within comes out.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.320]   That's the whole principle.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:25.720]   And that is the whole difference between religion and Christianity.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.760]   The religious man is like your Christmas tree.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.200]   It's manufactured.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.440]   It's artificial.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.280]   And you add things on to your branches.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:38.040]   And of course, you paint them and you make them look as if it was an orange or an apple
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.040]   or whatever it may be.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.920]   Oh, it's amazingly, I know, it's so similar that people like Nicodemus are confused, and
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.000]   many of us have been in the same position with him.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.560]   But you see, it's not the same thing.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.960]   It's essentially different.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.200]   It is vitally different.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:41:01.120]   It's different from mechanics and the divine life in the soul.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:07.080]   And all I'm saying is this, that when the seed of divine life is put in a man, the fruit
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.440]   is going to appear.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.160]   It must appear.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.360]   You never get it with religion and morality.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.960]   Now, I want to make this so clear.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.240]   There's a book that's recently come out.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.800]   You may have seen it by a man, a statesman, a well-known statesman.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.440]   He calls it "Halfway to Faith."
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:29.440]   You know, I almost think we all ought to be compelled to read that for this reason.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.680]   He shows you so clearly, without intending to do so, I believe, the difference between
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.880]   religion and Christianity.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.840]   He describes his own father and mother.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.840]   I have no doubt both of them, I know that his father did, thought that he was a Christian.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.840]   But was he?
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.920]   Can a man who's a Christian be cold?
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.120]   Can a man who's truly Christian never talk to his own children about these matters?
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.240]   There it is, "Halfway to Faith" by Lord Eccles.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.040]   It shows you this very thing.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.560]   You can be religious, you can be orthodox, you can have it all as it were and yet have
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   nothing.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:09.760]   If you haven't got the life of God in the soul, there's no fruit.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:15.000]   And what I'm trying to show you is that this being life of God in the soul, it always does
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.280]   produce this fruit.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:22.480]   Matthew Arnold, you remember, defined Christianity wrongly, of course, but this was his definition.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:26.560]   He says it's "morality tinged with immersion."
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.560]   Morality tinged with immersion.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:35.720]   He was defining religion and he confused between religion and Christianity.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.320]   Yes, but that's not Christianity.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.400]   Christianity is not merely tinged with emotion, it's vibrant with emotion.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.920]   It's living with life, which includes emotion.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.240]   And here the apostle, you see, gives us the great list.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.560]   There's no need for me to go through them.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.880]   I need only mention them so that we test ourselves.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.280]   The fruit of the Spirit is love.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.760]   Love to God.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.120]   Love to man.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:09.440]   The Pharisees talked a lot about God, but they knew nothing about the love of God.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   Nothing at all.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:19.080]   Oh, my dear friends, here's the question, not merely do we believe in God, do you love
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.080]   God?
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   How do you think instinctively of God?
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   Love.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.080]   God is love.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:30.480]   And if we've got something of his life in us, we'll have love in us.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.480]   Love God.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.040]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and mind and strength,
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:41.440]   and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.160]   One of the fruits of the Spirit.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.160]   Then secondly, joy.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.080]   Love joy.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:57.800]   Read that book, I say, and there you'll see religion, but joyless, cold, hard, mechanical,
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   lifeless.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.880]   There's no joy in it.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.680]   And this is one of the best tests, again, to differentiate between religion and Christianity.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   There it was in Romans 14, 17, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.600]   and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost."
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.400]   How much joy is there in you?
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.440]   If you don't know anything about this joy, you're just religious, you're not Christian.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:27.040]   This is a joy that enables the men to rejoice in tribulations.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:33.680]   We rejoice also in tribulations, says Paul in Romans 5, 3.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.720]   You see, this is a joy which, as our Lord puts it in John 16, "The world can neither
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.200]   give nor take away."
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.200]   It's His joy.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.600]   "My peace, my joy give I unto you."
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:50.400]   And it's a joy that a man has irrespective of his circumstances and conditions.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.320]   And it must be that, because if your joy depends upon your circumstances and conditions, well,
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.920]   it's going to be very variable.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.680]   And you'll sooner or later be in the position when you cannot have any joy at all.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.680]   But it isn't joy.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.080]   Joy is a great principle that's within.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.760]   It's a condition of soul which is inexplicable.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:14.000]   One just knows that one has a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.420]   Joy.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.880]   The religious men never know joy.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.880]   I believe that our churches and much else in the world today is entirely due to this
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.920]   fact that religion has been pushing itself in and true Christianity has gone out.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:33.600]   I'm not talking about an artificial joy, a mechanical joviality that ever makes one
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.400]   more miserable than anything else.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.840]   Joy is an inner quality of soul.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.720]   It's a glow in the soul that nothing but the Spirit of God can produce.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.720]   Peace.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.760]   Peace like a river.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.840]   The peace of God that passeth all understanding.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:52.840]   In nothing be anxious.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.840]   Nothing.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.320]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.080]   In nothing be anxious.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:04.000]   But in all things with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving let your requests be made
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.480]   known unto God and the peace of God that passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.040]   minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:16.080]   My friends, do you know anything of that peace which amazes you yourself?
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.800]   That you're amazed that you can be at such peace?
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.880]   This is a thing that happens to you when the life of God is put in you.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.760]   It's one of the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.560]   Love, joy, peace, long suffering.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:31.480]   It explains itself, doesn't it, in your attitude towards other people.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.880]   Patience, long suffering, gentleness.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.400]   Not flabbiness, but gentleness.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.720]   The stronger the man, the more gentle he is likely to be.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.800]   He's not just some flabby individual who's spineless.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.720]   That's not gentleness.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.960]   It's only a really strong man who can be really gentle.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:50.960]   Look at this.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.960]   Look at the Apostle Paul.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.960]   He can be stern.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.080]   He can be strong.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.280]   He can be logical.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.040]   He can condemn and rebuke.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.040]   But was there ever such a gentle soul?
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.040]   Gentleness.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.040]   Why?
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:09.040]   Well, because it's something of the character of our blessed Lord himself within us.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.040]   Goodness.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.640]   That means essential goodness.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.480]   Not merely not doing things that are wrong, but there's a positive goodness.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.160]   This again is a quality of soul that comes out everywhere.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   Faith, which means faithfulness, reliable, trustworthy, one you can always be sure of.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.160]   Modesty.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.160]   Meekness.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.160]   That's not mock modesty.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.160]   It's meekness.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:35.640]   Again, one of our Lord's own beatitudes and temperance.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.120]   And temperance, you see, means self-control.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.120]   It means self-discipline.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:44.480]   But the thing we've got to emphasize here is this, that it's not merely a discipline
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.920]   that's based upon observance of rules and regulations.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.920]   It's instinctive.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.000]   Now, if I let me use an illustration just as I close.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.600]   You know the difference, don't you, between a real gentleman and a man who is trying to
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.800]   behave as a gentleman.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.680]   That's the difference.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.440]   The religious man has his kind of discipline.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.880]   But it's not an internal discipline.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.360]   It's not an instinctive discipline.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.840]   The Christian has this instinctive self-control.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:22.680]   You see, he's dominated by this desire to know God and to be righteous and to be like
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.680]   him.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:29.760]   And instinctively, in all things, food, drink, everything else, there is this instinctive
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:36.440]   balance, discipline, self-control.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.760]   He's not just trying to be something.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.360]   He knows he is something.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:48.080]   And that thing that he is is the thing that controls him and disciplines him in all his
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.080]   ways.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.400]   Well, we have to leave it at that for this morning.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.720]   But oh, have I given you some conception?
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:02.320]   I trust I have by the grace of God that the thing we are talking about is a life.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.120]   Let's forget legalism and mechanics.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:10.040]   It's life and it's given by him and it's miraculous and supernatural.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:17.480]   You can't add it to yourself, but you go to him and you say, "I realize I'm not.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.520]   Thou must save and thou alone.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.640]   Thou must work this operation in my soul.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:26.000]   Thou has said, 'Ye must be born again.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.520]   I can't give birth to myself.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:32.160]   Grant that thy blessed spirit may do it to me.'"
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.880]   That's it.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:42.960]   Once this life is put into you, these are the things that begin to show themselves.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.720]   And they show themselves inevitably.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.400]   Amen.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:53.040]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
