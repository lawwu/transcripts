[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.760]   Friday Q&A and I have three
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.360]   Straightforward financial planning questions selected for you. They'll be interesting, but they're straightforward
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.600]   Vincent says I got a bunch of money. Can I afford to retire?
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.920]   Kip says I got too much cash. What do I do? And Joe says do I put money in my traditional 401k or a
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.840]   Roth 401k, please help
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.600]   Welcome to the radical personal finance podcast. My name is Joshua sheets and today is Friday, January 30
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.000]   2015 this is the show where you get to ask me anything and I get to tell you what I think
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.880]   It's kind of nice to be asked for your opinion. Sometimes actually a lot of times people don't like to hear it, but
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.160]   Please I'll give you a few ideas of the way I think and hopefully give you a little bit of clarity and understanding and
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.500]   topic financial stuff
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.500]   This
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.240]   Is the show where each and every day I help you unpack and
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.340]   understand the wild woolly world of financial planning and financial advice and
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.040]   What to do with your money and I can't think of a more fun thing to talk about on a more fun job to have
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.180]   Than mine. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to do this for you for at least a number of fairly lengthy shows this
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.900]   Week, so I've decided to just answer three questions today, and they're fairly straightforward
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.940]   just some simple financial planning questions and
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.620]   We'll see how long it takes but I just picked three and decided to do a quick short quick and short Q&A
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.900]   After all, I think I've probably released
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.680]   Like 11 hours of content already this week. So hopefully this one will be 30 45 minutes 50 minutes something like that
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.680]   Hopefully it'll be less than an hour
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.380]   so let's kick it off with an email from Vincent and
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.540]   The subject line of Vincent's email was I think something like please save us from our financial planner
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.300]   So that's a good way to warm my heart. So let's start with this dear Joshua
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.820]   My wife and I are well read in the areas of index fund investing frugal living
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.940]   Early retirement and financial independence including your podcasts
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.620]   We have been on the path to early retirement for many years and we think we are there
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.860]   We both have high stress jobs and want to quit to raise a child and do whatever interest interests us
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.700]   Whether it brings additional income or not
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.300]   We want to have a significant financial cushion, but also don't want to be so conservative that we work years longer than necessary
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.700]   We are worriers and are very conservative in our estimates
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.780]   Although we are fairly confident in our calculations for early retirement timing
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.420]   We hired a fee only financial planner for an outside opinion and the experience was positive
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.260]   But we believe the timing recommended was extremely conservative four years from now without a child
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.860]   Five to six years from now with a child
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.980]   We have a very good handle on our spending as we have been tracking it closely for several years
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.200]   the financial planner did not seem to understand our frugal lifestyle and rather than reducing our current spending by the
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.940]   Cost of working that we clearly communicated. He added
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.380]   $15,000 per year to our current spending which significantly changes the projections for retirement
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.500]   the explanation given was to account for
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.780]   Unexpected expenses, but that amounts to approximately
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.900]   $20,000 per year in excess of our retirement spending estimate below
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.980]   We would be very grateful for your opinion of our plan to retire now
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.300]   Given the following data, which we have abbreviated to the most important points
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:14.220]   ages him 45 her 37 debts none own a house and two cars free and clear
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.540]   assets 1 million three hundred thousand six hundred and forty six dollars of
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.380]   Which about seven hundred thousand boxes in a TSP, which is the federal?
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.760]   Savings program thrift thrift savings plan for federal employees
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.860]   350 grand in Vanguard index funds and a taxable account little over two hundred thousand in cash and I bonds
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.660]   22,000 and Roth IRA is
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.100]   $31,000 his pension starting at age 60 and six grand her pension starting at age 62
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:52.340]   There will be a minimum of one hundred thousand dollars net after moving and downsizing our house not included in the assets above
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.940]   So we have about 1.4 million dollars of cash to play with right now
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.420]   We're invested 40% of the total US stock market fund 12% in the total international stock market fund
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:08.740]   33% bonds in the G fund which is in the thrift savings plan and 15% in cash and we're currently spending
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.280]   $45,000 and we estimate that our retirement spending will be
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.340]   $37,000 per year
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.980]   This is after removing the easily calculated
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.260]   so-called costs of working about ten thousand dollars in property tax and three thousand dollars in gas and
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.280]   Adding estimated cost of health insurance about five thousand dollars per year
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.200]   Note, we'll be moving from a very high cost area suburban Chicago to a very low cost area rural, Florida
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.060]   Isn't that awesome Vincent
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.860]   How awesome?
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.620]   Congratulations, dude, you guys are rocking it. I love love love getting emails like this. How exciting is that?
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.480]   I mean you're 45 years old. You got a million and a half bucks, basically
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.440]   You know by the time it sounds like you're gonna you're gonna net a hundred thousand dollars after you buy a smaller house is what?
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.140]   It sounded like from your email
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.780]   so you've got at least you know, you've got at least a
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.460]   Million and a half bucks man, that is exciting
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.500]   Congratulations. So to answer your question
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.940]   Yes, you can afford to retire and
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.900]   Yes, you can afford to do it now if you are confident in your spending numbers
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.340]   So one of the challenges here, and I think you're you're probably being
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.300]   You are probably being a little bit
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.100]   You're being conservative
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.220]   and I think being conservative is awesome. I
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.740]   Applaud you for sending me a note and I applaud you for going and talking to the financial planner
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.740]   I'll talk a little bit about that experience and why it probably was the way that you do to help you understand
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.740]   Excuse me why it was the way that it was to help you understand a little bit more
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.020]   about what your planner was thinking but
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:07:02.020]   The biggest challenge you're gonna have to face is your fear of the future and I think that a few years after you retire
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:09.500]   You're gonna have this well in hand. What I would do if I were you is I would figure out how to call
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.460]   Doug Nordman from the military guide.com. He did an interview on the show
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.180]   I'll post a link to that interview in the show notes if you haven't heard it and he's gonna come back on the show
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.820]   It's quite popular and he's gonna come back. He's out of town. He's traveling for a bit right now. He's retired
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.420]   So why does he have to work?
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.020]   But I'm going to have him on we're gonna talk about a few things
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.940]   But I'm gonna talk about we're gonna talk about fear of retiring
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.580]   Because that's what I hear in your message and I'll give you the financial numbers in just a minute
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.100]   but the biggest thing you're gonna have to face is the fear of
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.020]   crossing the chasm and
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.020]   Basically just simply making the decision
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.860]   to quit
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.180]   Now I
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.540]   Haven't experienced this with being financially independent
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:01.780]   I am not yet financially independent and able to live off of purely off of the the dividends and growth of my portfolio
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:10.460]   but Doug has and he's gone through some tough times and but I have experienced this with striking out into
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:16.420]   Entrepreneurship. The biggest challenge is simply making the decision that you're gonna do it and
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.620]   As soon as you make that decision that you're gonna do it and now's the time
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:27.820]   Guaranteed you'll figure out a way and there's not a doubt in my mind that you're able to retire
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.660]   It's not a doubt in my mind
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.580]   everything in your
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.580]   Email that you wrote to me
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.700]   Indicates that you're careful that you're thoughtful that you're a planner that you are expert
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:46.180]   even if I look and I breeze through this when describing your portfolio for the radio, but if I look at how your portfolio is structured and
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.940]   Where you've chosen it's clear that you know what you're doing with running your own finances
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.060]   and
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:59.060]   It's clear that you've planned for this you've worked for this you have focused on this you have a clear plan
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.580]   You have a clear budget
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.140]   So you're a planner and you're there
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:12.400]   Now there's nothing I can say that's gonna take away that that little nagging fear that's at the back of your mind though until you do it
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.300]   There's nothing I can say because the reality is can I guarantee you that you're going to be financially independent?
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.020]   And you're never gonna ever face the problem of ever having to work again
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:28.220]   I would never make that guarantee and I and it is anybody who could there's no way to guarantee it
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:35.140]   No matter how conservative your portfolio is there's always some scenario that we could make up that could be a problem
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.220]   So let's say that your scenario is beautifully allocated in your plan works
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:44.040]   And in that case the 4% rule the 3% rule or whatever works awesome for you. Well, you're set
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.620]   but what if
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:52.380]   We're coming off of a 30-year bubble and bonds and your bond portion of your portfolio doesn't work
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:58.380]   and what if all of the growth in the stock market is completely fake because it's completely subject to
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.300]   You know
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.460]   Quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve pumping up the market and that's why the market is pumped up
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:11.540]   And so now for the next 20 years stock stands still and nothing works the way that is supposed to what if what if we're in?
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.260]   a new norm
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260]   Well, are you gonna be okay?
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.300]   and
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.660]   I'm telling you you're gonna be okay, even if your portfolio is not
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:27.080]   What if you take all your money and you put it into a guaranteed annuity payment split among four or five really well run
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:33.980]   Insurance companies and you know that no matter what you've got your 40 grand coming in that you need coming in
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.100]   Was it possible that the insurance company could go out of business?
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:45.020]   It's a possible that the dollar could lose its value. Is it possible that we could enter into a you know a wacky time of
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:52.500]   Global economy, it's a possible we could go into a world war. All of these things are possible
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.900]   They're improbable. They're highly improbable, but anything is possible
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.500]   So if you spend all of your time focusing on here's what's possible man
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.380]   I could go read zero hedge for a few minutes and you'll be convinced that you you know
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.380]   you need to cash out every single one of your
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.380]   Investment accounts from right today and you got to sell everything and you're just doomed
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.540]   So the major thing you've got to learn to deal with is you got to learn to figure out how are you gonna handle your
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.540]   fear
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.620]   and
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:28.500]   I think the way you're gonna handle is by being confident in yourself and in your confidence and your ability to make things happen
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.700]   I think you probably already are I'm just making the point to encourage you a little bit
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.500]   I don't think frankly that you're sitting around waiting for me
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.420]   You know desperate for me to answer your question to give you that
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.740]   That attaboy go ahead and then you're gonna do it and pull the team
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.700]   You're gonna march in tomorrow after you hear this and tell your boss
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.620]   I think you've already got the plan and you're just taking advantage of
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.900]   Of an opportunity to get a double-checked a double-checked opinion
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:57.020]   And I think that's great and I don't think you really care or needed to know what the fee-only financial planner
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.420]   But you're a prudent person and you never know what you don't know and I applaud you for that
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.020]   But the key is you've got to learn how to manage your fear
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:08.180]   I think the only way to manage your fear at least that I can come up with is
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.220]   to be confident in yourself and in your ability and
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.780]   If you had a worst-case scenario
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:21.220]   Let's say that you and your wife retire and she's diagnosed with cancer next year and all of a sudden your insurance is
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.980]   Insufficient and you spend you know a million dollars out of pocket on her treatment
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.300]   You're going to places that aren't covered and you're working like crazy to get her treatment. You know what?
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.700]   You would be okay
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.620]   Because you'd get another job
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.900]   You're not gonna lose your ability to work
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.860]   You're not gonna lose your ability to be financially productive
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.340]   You didn't list your salaries on here, but I guarantee they're pretty good
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.940]   Both of you said you have high stress jobs and they bring in high income
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.900]   So you're not gonna lose that you're not gonna lose that ability
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.980]   even if something happened and you were found liable for
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:04.180]   Something and you lost all your money. All your money were stolen from you invested with Bernie Madoff and it's all gone
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.380]   You know what you'd make it back
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.540]   Because you're the kind of person who becomes wealthy
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:16.980]   You are wealthy because of the kind of person you've become and you don't cease becoming you not don't cease being that person
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.980]   If you lose your money
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.060]   You're gonna be fine
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:27.020]   Now let's run some quick numbers and here's the only number you need to worry about for this simple math
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.980]   You do need to figure out how to structure a portfolio
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.980]   But just look at the look at the rate of return that you need from your portfolio in order for you to
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.740]   In order for you to make this work, and here's a couple ways. I'll put this into into
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.620]   into
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.660]   Focus so you have one point four million dollars of assets here
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.820]   And you say that you estimate your retirement spending to be thirty seven thousand dollars
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.060]   Well, if we go by the much-proclaimed
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:59.200]   Four percent rule four percent of one point four million dollars would be fifty six thousand dollars
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.660]   Substantially more than thirty seven thousand dollars
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.900]   If we go three percent of one point four million would be forty two thousand dollars
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.880]   Three percent it's pretty conservative estimate
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:21.980]   If we flip it around and we say let's figure out what percentages of it of your net nest egg is thirty seven thousand dollars
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:29.540]   Divide thirty seven thousand dollars by one point four million and what you wind up with is you wind up with two point six percent
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.980]   That's your current withdrawal rate from your portfolio at a spending level of thirty seven thousand dollars
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:44.380]   That is the safest of the safe when it comes to safe withdrawal rates of a balanced portfolio and all of the research that we can
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.400]   Look at now remember all that we can do as financial planners is go based upon the research
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.060]   And you can read and probably have read all the same studies that we've read
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:56.020]   And I don't know anyone that would say that two point six percent wisely invested
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:01.860]   It couldn't be maintained a two percent two point six percent withdrawal rate couldn't be maintained into perpetuity
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.060]   So if your retirement spending is actually thirty seven thousand dollars
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.780]   It doesn't get safer than that
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:15.940]   You can hit two point six percent off of dividends. You're gonna hit two point six percent off of income if you build an income portfolio
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.020]   You can bet you can hit two point six percent on all kinds of things
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.100]   So
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.040]   Things are good. Let me give you another way to look at this
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.860]   Let's assume that you just put all your money in the bank. You split it up into a
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.660]   bunch of six different
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:42.820]   Individual accounts all of which have FDIC insurance and the question is how long will one point four million dollars last you if
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.820]   You spend thirty seven thousand dollars per year
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.060]   That is thirty eight years of income
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.820]   It's thirty seven point eight four thirty eight years of income if you don't make any
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.820]   interest on your money and
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.340]   You didn't include although you did mention your pension. You didn't include Social Security payments
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.700]   We're not factoring that into the two point six percent
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.340]   You didn't include any kind of side income and I know that you don't want to plan on that
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.660]   But I'm telling you you're gonna find a way to make some money doing something
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.700]   I just
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.860]   Maybe there are people who don't but I've never seen them
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:19.260]   You're gonna find a way to do something make you know, five hundred bucks here and a couple thousand bucks there
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:25.700]   So it doesn't get any safer than your scenario if your numbers are accurate
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.860]   And this is why you ran into my I bet you ran into problems with your planner
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:39.420]   There I don't know any financial planner that specializes in working with the early retirement financial independent
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:44.140]   Independence community. I really don't and although I love the community. I
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:52.140]   Probably myself wouldn't actually specialize in that area if it were a planner and the reason is purely selfish
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:58.580]   The early retirement financial independence community is made up of a massive number of awesome people
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.060]   who are very very frugal and very very cost-conscious and
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:11.060]   it's a good business decision usually to serve people who like to pay you money and who are less cost-conscious and
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:18.460]   I personally believe that most businesses that are working in luxury business instead of a necessary business instead of in
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.180]   What's the opposite of luxury necessity?
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.700]   Necessity businesses that are gonna be more well served
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:31.300]   so if I were ever building a business, I would want to work in the luxury market because the money flows more quickly and
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:37.900]   So the early retirement financial independent community is awesome extremely frugal. That's who I am
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.060]   But as a business person, I would focus more on serving me personally
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.980]   I would focus on serving the Palm Beach crowd
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:50.880]   You know serving them in a multi-family office or a single-family office or serving like the people who value
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.660]   Things and it's not just about where can I get the best deal now? This is not an insult in any way
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.260]   I'm just illustrating why I think there aren't more planners serving
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:05.940]   Serving this community there may be a couple out there and I think that if those one or two can identify themselves
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:12.540]   They'll have more business than they know what to do with because there's such an active online presence in the various early retirement
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:17.020]   Forums, but the active online presence is very much made up of
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.620]   Also do-it-yourself errs
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.820]   Like you you know what you're talking about
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.620]   And so I compare this to if I'm a chef starting a restaurant
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.420]   Should I start a restaurant specialized in selling high-end food to other chefs?
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.900]   That's what's tough
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:37.740]   That's my best gut feeling on why more people aren't serving the early retirement community with financial planning
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:43.340]   I wouldn't start a business trying to serve high-end meals to chefs. Not the chefs won't go and do it
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:50.180]   but it's a whole lot easier for me to serve high-end meals to consumers who just love to eat and don't know how to cook and
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:57.620]   So the media in the financial independent space things like I'm doing things like bloggers are doing things like where people create maybe
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.980]   Products of some kind those are great
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:08.220]   And the reason they're great the reason my show has such a wide audience of early retirement financial independence community is I'm serving up
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:16.180]   Information on the subject that people who are hungry for information are hungry for so this is why if you go out in the mass market
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.980]   I'm not serving up information necessarily to people in the mass market
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:26.220]   Although I'd love to but they're just most people aren't out there interested in saying how can I learn about personal finance?
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.740]   It's a different type of person so I can serve this community with information
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:35.380]   That's helpful, and maybe I can build a business on that, but it's hard to serve with high-priced financial planning
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:41.500]   So most financial planners my point in all that was to give a little insight most financial planners have never dealt with
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:47.340]   Somebody from the early retirement community and in fact most financial planners based upon my experience
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.660]   I would say have zero interest in the early retirement
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.340]   themselves
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.340]   Yes, they're building towards early retirement
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.580]   But most of us that get into this business were attracted by the large
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:06.860]   Dollar figures that can be made and so therefore it's much more likely that we're gonna live and want to live a high lifestyle
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.660]   Than to build a frugal lifestyle of early retirement
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.220]   I was the only person that I ever knew as a financial planner who was actually
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.660]   working toward that
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:23.700]   Most many financial advisors love to spend and they it doesn't the concept of yes savings
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.780]   I'm not saying they're that they're that they're dumb they save money
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:32.620]   But the idea of just trying to get done as quick as you can is not that's not normal
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.980]   So they're not used to thinking about it. They don't spend time reading it
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:41.260]   You know most people don't spend time and most people who are financial advisors don't spend time in early retirement forums
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.260]   It's not something that's of interest to them
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:49.940]   The other thing is this is important that you understand with the structure of their business when you go into a financial advisory business
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.660]   Everything in your business is deferred compensation
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:58.980]   So the idea if I were to say how could I build a business where I can you know in five years?
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.580]   let's say I'm gonna how can I make as much money as I can in five years and
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.220]   quit
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:09.500]   It would be foolish to try to approach the financial advice business with that with that mentality
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.260]   Because everything is based on the long run
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:18.260]   Everything is built on that long tail and you where you get rich is a really rich as a financial advisor is if you start at
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.140]   25 you're hustling from 25 to 30 and you are broke
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.300]   Then from 30 to 40 you're kind of making it but then it's from 40 to 70
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.180]   That you really make money and so I can't think of anybody
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.580]   I know who would do what you're doing and walk away and if any financial advisor
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.900]   I know who would do what you're doing and walk away because the cost of walking away is simply too high
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:47.260]   It's you've put too much time and too much sweat into building your business. It's just simply too high
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.540]   I hope you can understand that. It's not I don't think it's right or wrong
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:57.340]   It's just a little bit of insight the other thing to recognize because financial advisors don't know don't deal with people who like you
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:03.940]   Usually people are coming to us either who oftentimes who have problems or who are just simply not so not so tight
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:08.500]   It's very rare to meet somebody who actually knows consistently how much they're spending
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.900]   in the years that I worked as a financial advisor and in the over a thousand clients that I
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:20.620]   Perspective clients that I worked with face to face. I could probably say off of that number a
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:30.260]   Dozen to a dozen or two that actually knew what they were spending a
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:37.460]   Very small portion of those dozen maybe a handful were kind of really focused
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.900]   Like Dave Ramsey budgeters where they just say oh, here's my monthly budget for last month. That is
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.060]   Conceivably rare to find someone who knows that
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.100]   The other ones just simply would you know?
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:55.340]   The type of people who know exactly is they just ask their bookkeeper or their accountant and they prepare annual financial statements
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.580]   And they just okay. I we spent two hundred eighty thousand dollars last year. That's that's basically it
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:06.940]   Almost nobody in our society tracks their money and if they do track it, it's not actual
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:14.740]   Detailed data and so we as me as a planner. I almost never use a client's numbers
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:22.300]   What I try to do when I'm calculating how much a client needs to spend is back into it. I take their gross income
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.300]   I estimate their taxes
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.500]   Then I pull out any
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.220]   Any ongoing payments that I know of so what's the principal and interest payment on their mortgage?
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.680]   How much is going to the car payment and then I back out any retirement contributions
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:41.000]   And I usually tell them what they're spending and I know more what they're spending than they are because I can look at the numbers
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.180]   Most people don't have any money in savings so I can look at the retirement accounts
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:50.420]   I can find out how much is going into that account and now I know what the actual number is of what they're spending
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:55.280]   And so as a planner, especially if you only met with this person one time
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:02.380]   It's very likely that as he yeah, you said it's a he it's very likely that he just simply has never met anybody like you
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.140]   and so to add a fifteen thousand dollars per year of a slush fund is
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.220]   very
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.220]   Is very prudent on his part
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:17.660]   But if you don't need that fifteen thousand dollars a slush fund then then you're okay and
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:23.580]   I doubt that you do because I doubt I bet you that you know exactly what you spend in each category
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:28.100]   I mean you've calculated your cost of working that means you've read your money or your life
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:33.140]   that means you have a chart sitting there with your categories and you know exactly what's gonna change and
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.340]   so
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.660]   You got to understand that I think that would explain kind of the disconnect
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:44.360]   There is nothing I could that you could do at this point. There's gonna make you safer and more ready to retire
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.260]   Pull the plug go
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.460]   It's what I say and
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.220]   a year or two or three from now
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:25:00.020]   You're gonna have a totally different feeling and if you feel like it's stressing you out and you're spending too much money
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:07.580]   Just do something part-time build a financial advice business consulting to early early retirement community
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.260]   Because you could do that and you know
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:16.980]   I mean that that that's your three-year project and do it virtually like with that business model that I described the other day
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.660]   show before last
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:25.340]   You've got this man go for it. There's nothing you can do check on your insurance. Make sure your insurance is lined up
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:30.100]   The only thing that could sink the one the one thing that could sink you would be something like long-term care
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.460]   Maybe you've considered long-term care insurance
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.860]   If you haven't consider make sure you plan for it
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.860]   If you don't have long-term care insurance
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:44.820]   Or think about getting long-term care insurance research that topic and just consider what you're gonna do. It's it's highly improbable
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.660]   That you're gonna need it
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.740]   You're young. You're probably very healthy. You're probably gonna be even healthier
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:57.180]   but that's one of those things that we as planners worry about so at least consider it and make a decision because that's one of
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.180]   those things that you know
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.940]   You turn 52 and you get early onset Alzheimer's and now you know
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:10.580]   Your wife has to spend the next 15 years caring for you that can that can scramble a million-dollar nest egg pretty quickly
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.580]   You know, she's got a higher care
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.180]   now that's not what you're that's clearly not what you're planning for your your
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.100]   Your retirement and you've got to figure out the risk factor. You've got to figure out. Are you worried about that risk?
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.900]   Are you okay with that risk?
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:29.140]   But work out your long-term care planning figure out your health insurance planning, but there's nothing you can come up with
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.140]   That's gonna be safer for you today
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.540]   Pull the trigger go for it. That's my answer
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:41.460]   Next question Kip says Joshua came across your podcast and I dig the advice in the honesty
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:48.080]   I've read numerous articles encouraging the use of fee-based financial advisors, but haven't had a lot of luck finding the right person
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:54.100]   Discouragement set in after numerous canned responses and what seemed like aggressive sales tactics
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:54.740]   I
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:00.460]   made somewhat of a half-baked attempt in my early 20s with regularly maxing out a Roth and always
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.100]   Contributing enough to various company 401ks to get the contribution match
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:09.020]   I've not paid a lot of attention and I recently realized that I'm holding
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:14.740]   50% of my total assets in a standard savings account yielding only 1%
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:22.700]   Without pulling the actual figures, that'd be about 90,000 bucks in retirement accounts Roth traditional rollover and about
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.140]   $90,000 in straight-up cash
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.100]   Terrible, I know
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.980]   My question is this
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:34.660]   How do I fix or prevent this? I currently have one investment property with a mortgage
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.500]   That's less than what it's leasing for. I see a couple of fix-it options
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:47.140]   I could buy another house. I could pay down my existing mortgage. I could invest outside of a retirement account. I
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:53.900]   Believe adjusting my 401k contribution may be a start to preventing it. But what about after I max it out?
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.260]   I don't mind paying for advice
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:01.380]   But what I really want is someone that's hands-on and up-to-date who's helping me get the most out of my money
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:05.420]   Kip a lot of people in the audience are screaming at you right now
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.260]   Here's what I'd say very simply what on earth are you trying to do?
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:16.340]   And I mean that not in a snide way or a snotty way. I just mean like what what are you trying to do?
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.820]   What are your goals?
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.220]   And that's where it all starts and that's where it all ends
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.340]   Clearly, it's clear to me by your statement and by the way that you wrote your email
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:32.660]   That you simply don't have any specific financial goals. You might have a general idea of a goal
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.580]   You might ask someday. I want to be rich someday
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.180]   I want to retire but you don't have any specific financial goals and
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.100]   That's okay. I'm not mad at you at most people don't
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:47.700]   The reality is almost nobody has specific financial goals. But my answer to you is what do you want to do?
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.740]   if for example
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:56.180]   you're like me and you want to travel with your kids and you want to buy an RV and cruise the world and and you know,
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.020]   Take a year and drive down to Argentina
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:07.620]   Then that $90,000 would be deployed into fixing up the house selling it so that you're free going and buying the RV
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.180]   Loading everything up and you would just simply use it to fund your trip
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:16.820]   If on the other hand you have a goal of starting a
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:23.700]   snowboard design business and this has always been a real passion of yours and you love snowboarding and for you the most
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.480]   You know fun thing you can think of is to figure out how to do that
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.440]   Then that $90,000 should be put into
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:38.420]   R&D and buying the equipment that you need maybe getting a 3d printer and and and taking two years off
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:43.500]   So you can develop the newest way to print carbon fiber for snowboards with a 3d printer
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:50.820]   Which you can you know sell the technology to the around the world and people can print snowboards on demand and they don't have to pay
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:54.180]   Baggage claim fees, you know for carrying the big snowboard bag
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.920]   Silly example, but it really is true
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:05.400]   Now if your goal is you know what I don't like my job and I want to be retired early and
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.920]   You know, then the next question is well, what's the better investment for you? What's the best investment for you?
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.760]   Maybe it's going ahead and buying a realist a house or maybe it's buying nine houses and putting
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:21.120]   10,000 bucks down on each of them because you're gonna build ten a real estate portfolio of ten rental houses and
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:27.040]   that's gonna be your ticket to financial independence so that you know, you work ten hours a week and and
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.640]   Play golf the rest of the time
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:35.720]   Or you're satisfied with life and you like your job and everything's pretty good and you just want to minimize some stress
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.440]   So in that case, you know pay off your mortgage
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.820]   So you don't ever have to worry about anything going wrong in the world
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:45.160]   You always have a paid-for house and just toss the money in a 401k and be done with it
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.200]   And I'm not being flippant
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.280]   What I'm illustrating is that the way to answer your question is simply decide what you want
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.480]   This is why working from a list of written goals is so important
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:04.720]   Especially personal goals, which are always funded with finance and then working with those financial goals and having them ordered
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.680]   What is my biggest opportunity right now? What is the thing that I'm trying to do?
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.000]   If you know that then the answer is very clear
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.880]   so at all times
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   Practically, we should have a list of here's what's the next most important thing. Do you want to give the money away?
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.240]   you know, would you like to go and actually make a difference and give the money and you have a
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.000]   Way to do that that for you is a big deal
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.160]   You know, I know I know people all over the world and you know
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:40.400]   I'd love to give ninety thousand dollars and and there's little businesses. I'd love to start that would help people and
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.760]   little ways that that can you know, really contribute and I
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:49.480]   Won't get into more detail than that from my perspective, but maybe that's what you want to do
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.680]   maybe you want to do like
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:59.000]   You know the urban farming guys did and quit your job and move into the inner city and that ninety thousand dollars
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.480]   You're gonna use to buy three little houses
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   You know for five thousand bucks each and you're gonna invest the rest of it and the mission of your life is going to be
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   to transform an inner city neighborhood
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.400]   Maybe that's what you should do
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.120]   What do you want out of life?
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:20.200]   And I'm not being the least bit flippant, but when you answer that question
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.000]   Then it will be very apparent to you
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.200]   What you should put the cash into
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:33.320]   Until you know the answer to that question you probably should just leave it sitting in the bank
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:39.160]   No matter what, you know because if you if you wait six months
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:44.240]   What are you gonna lose out on you know an extra six hundred and eighty two dollars?
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.800]   Till you know the answer to that question. It should probably sit in the bank, but you should answer that question
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.560]   Once you answer it, you're gonna know
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:57.320]   Now I'm gonna make an additional comment. I replied back to Kip when he email me. I said, hey, thanks for the answer
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.360]   I put it on my queue for the Friday Q&A shows. I just said short answer start with your goals
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.720]   Why are you investing at all? What's the goal? You know when you know the goal? What is the optimal investment plan?
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.280]   It'll just work out and then you put the cash in let me slow down. I said then when you know the goal
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:15.080]   What is the optimal investment plan to hit your goals based on your unique skills and situation?
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:20.560]   then put all of the cash to work on that investment plan and he wrote back with this answer and
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:26.440]   The reason why this answer is important because it illustrates what most people think about their goals are
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.360]   When it comes to investing and it's good, but it's not good enough
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.800]   My primary motivation is passively capitalizing on my savings
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.680]   Ideally, I'd like a set it and forget it strategy
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.400]   modest gains with modest risk
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.480]   Maybe I need a portfolio manager early on an advisor put me in loaded funds
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:53.680]   I've had a hard time trusting since if I went with a portfolio manager, my main concern would be performance and cost
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.520]   I don't mind paying a fee, but I'd like it to be competitive and comparable
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:06.000]   So I'll answer this directly number one. My primary motivation is passively capitalizing on my savings. Why?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.080]   Again I'm not being flippant why?
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:16.400]   If it's okay, I like I just kind of like doing what I'm doing gonna toss some money here
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:23.040]   I'm really happy with life. Then that's then that's a good answer. And now we understand I want to set it and forget it strategy
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.440]   modest gains with modest risk
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.960]   I don't know what modest gains are and I don't know what modest risk is
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:36.520]   As far as I'm concerned everything is risky and everything has some gains and and you just got to figure out what risks
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.120]   Are you willing to bear?
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.600]   but
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.360]   Investing with just a generalized. Oh, this would be nice
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.920]   Man, you're doomed. You're doomed with that kind of plan
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.600]   Even if it's this long-range thing with retirement what you need to know is you need to know
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.560]   How much gains do you need to hit your goal? And if you don't have a goal, that's okay
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.760]   But you know, you're not gonna know what is modest and what is modest
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.920]   So the way that I would do that is back into it. So let me assume a mainstream scenario
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.320]   Let me assume Kip you're happy with life. You love, you know, you love what you do. You love where you live
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.480]   You just love everything that's going on with life
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:18.400]   Well, then still at what age would you like to be in a position to not to have to work if you didn't want to?
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.280]   calculate that
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.800]   Everything's great. I want to be a 75 perfect. Now we know
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.360]   Or 65 or 55 or 62 or 71?
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.160]   Whatever
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.380]   Okay, how much income would you like coming in at that point in time? That's the next question about what I have now
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.380]   All right. What do you have now?
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:42.440]   We calculate that out. How much can you save and afford afford to save and invest every month right now and
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.480]   That's gonna give you the rate of return and then calculate back and ask yourself
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.480]   What's the rate of return that I need from my portfolio?
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.300]   For me to hit this on an inflation adjusted basis
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.480]   And
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.880]   Then that'll let you know what you need now if you need a 1% return
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:05.360]   Then your answer is probably 1% nominal not real but 1% nominal which this you would never need this
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.880]   But if you need a 1% rate nominal rate of term meaning the stated rate of return
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:14.440]   Even after you've adjusted your calculations for inflation, you're just saving so much money every month that you can get there
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.560]   Well now you why take any more risk?
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:22.480]   You just trot down to the bank and you buy CDs and now you have modest gains and there's practically no risk. It's modest risk
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:29.080]   At least it's modest market risk. It's not necessarily modest dollar risk. It's not necessarily modest inflation risk
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.860]   It's not necessarily modest any of those risks just modest market risk
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.500]   But that's not gonna be the answer to that calculation and so
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:43.180]   You do another calculation and the answer is I need a 6% rate of return. Okay. Well, how can you get that?
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.140]   Well this you might trot down and you know
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:51.480]   But do what Vincent did in the last the last question earned by a Vanguard, you know
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.480]   Total stock market index fund modest risk. It's got some market risk, but it's pretty deferred
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:02.960]   You know also modest gain not gonna be anything spectacular, but it's probably gonna deliver, you know, five six percent
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.960]   Probably a little bit more but who knows
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.760]   Modest gain modest risk set it and forget it
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:18.440]   That's my answer and you've got to answer every investment question with what's my goal for this investment
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.260]   What's my goal for this investment? Why am I investing?
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.520]   because remember every dollar that you invest is a dollar that you can't consume and
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:32.000]   We don't invest for any purpose other than future consumption. That's it
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:40.200]   You invest so that you have more money in the future for you to consume. That's rational. So if you don't need to invest
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:45.480]   Then go ahead and consume it now and you can consume it in any way that aligns with your values
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.040]   You can consume it on fancy stuff. You can consume it on fancy trips
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.960]   You can consume it on a trip around the world
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:56.600]   You can consume it by giving it away because that brings you pleasure and you're the what's that the guy that goes out at Christmas
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.020]   Time you're mr. Santa Claus or whatever and you've given out hundred dollar bills
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:06.360]   That's consumption and that's in line with I suppose his values. I mean, of course, it's in line. He wouldn't do it if it weren't
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:12.180]   It's pretty simple but you got to know your goals you got to know what you're trying to do
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.520]   When you get clear on that
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   The investment will make sense then then the best will will return it'll emerge
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:27.400]   One comment on the portfolio manager at this state. I wouldn't say what you need is a portfolio manager at this stage
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.640]   What I would say is you need a financial planner someone who can help you figure out what you want out of life
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.800]   And in that scenario, you've got to figure out, you know, who can you find that's gonna do that?
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:41.320]   One thing that concerns me well two things that concern me in your email here
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.720]   You said maybe I need a portfolio manager early on an investor an advisor put me in loaded funds
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:53.080]   I've had a hard time trusting since if I went with a portfolio manager, my main concern would be performance and cost
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:57.520]   I don't mind paying a fee, but I'd like it to be competitive or comparable. I
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:04.360]   Don't know what your experience was with the advisor who put you in loaded funds. I would say I disagree with many people
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.520]   There is nothing inherently unethical about selling or buying loaded mutual funds
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.160]   If that's the way that you've agreed with your financial advisor that they're gonna be
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.480]   Compensated is based upon the commission from the sale of a mutual fund
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.080]   Then that's the agreement that you've made
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:24.300]   So unless that was done in secret or unless the advisor didn't disclose that that was the case
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:28.200]   Then what was it that caused you to not trust that person?
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.480]   Just because a fund is a loaded fund again. I've sold plenty of loaded funds
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.840]   in the right context with full disclosure
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.240]   clearly showing my client what their options were and
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.560]   Clearly demonstrating the cost and the benefit. I
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.520]   Don't see the ethical problem with selling loaded funds
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.240]   If you want the advisor services
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.560]   They've got to be paid somewhow and that could be paid with an hourly fee
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.480]   With a check that you write out of your paycheck on some kind of monthly or annual retainer fee
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.000]   They can be paid on commission or they can be paid based upon
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:09.880]   A fee for assets under management. So I don't say I wouldn't say that you have a
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:15.960]   that there's necessarily something that you can't trust unless the advisor was deceptive and
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:24.440]   Where probably I think people might feel deceived is if they don't know that you can go out and buy unloaded funds
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.360]   but you know, do I
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:34.680]   Consider my my real estate agent to have deceived me because they get a commission when I bought a house with them when I could
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   Have gone out and bought a house without a commission
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:43.240]   That's where it's questionable. And so my only solution to that is full disclosure and careful conversations
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:49.680]   I always tried to make sure that every client knew all of their investing options and that if they wanted to work with me
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:55.740]   They did so because they needed and wanted my advice and then I presented to them the different ways that they that I'm
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.520]   Compensated and they could choose if they match certain scenarios
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.120]   they could choose and some of the times I was compensated with the sale of a loaded mutual fund and
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:13.880]   I believe my clients received far more value from me in that scenario than not and I've also had multiple clients
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:20.160]   Where they looked at the commissions and they looked at the fees and they said, you know what Joshua?
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.520]   I just can't I'm just not willing to pay this. I said I understand in that case. Here's what you can do
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:30.960]   Here's an online brokerage account. Here's an online mutual fund account. Here's an online this here's a this
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.480]   Here's where you can go and you can get this service for free
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:40.520]   And you know what to the best of my knowledge the two clients that I'm thinking of the money continues to sit in a savings account
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:45.960]   Because nobody has got they didn't want to pay my fees the money sits in the savings account
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.920]   They're no closer to their goals than they were when they met me and I hate that
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.600]   They would have been better off
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.440]   This wasn't what I proposed, but they would have been better off buying all loaded mutual funds
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.480]   Than they are right now because they missed out
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.640]   On a massive increase because their money was sitting in cash. So it's very tricky
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.040]   It's I mean the ethics of that I think are tricky and the only way I know how to deal with it
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:15.520]   It's to let each person make sure everyone is fully educated on all of their options that they understand what they're giving
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:20.240]   The second thing I will all comment on here is you said here if I went with a portfolio manager
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:25.400]   My main concern would be performance or cost. I don't mind paying a fee, but I'd like to be competitive or
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:31.540]   Comparable. I would recommend to you that you really understand what you what you expect an advisor to do for you
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:38.600]   You might find some advisors who will promise out performance. I have never seen any
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.280]   statistically reliable
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.440]   Indication that I can predict in advance who's going to outperform. I've never made that claim in my life
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:52.820]   To me that is not the primary service of an advisor. The primary service and of an advisor is
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:58.120]   Wrapped up in excellent financial planning and by that I'm referring in this context to
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:05.160]   Helping you with to save money on taxes helping you to make intelligent choices with your overall performance
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.040]   some excellent excellent financial coaching in the sense of
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.680]   Helping you to figure out what you want
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.360]   That's what you need is you need a life coach to help you figure out what you want
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:21.720]   And then number three helping you make sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:30.160]   Because if you say I need modest gains and modest risk if it were appropriate and over time if I were working with you
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.320]   I could get you into something with great gains and almost no risk and
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.540]   Coach you through those times that you need coaching
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:41.920]   Which is when you're about to bail when the market is at the bottom when you're about to jump into the latest greatest hot tip
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   That you got when the market is at the top
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.880]   so that is
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:52.160]   You got to understand the services different advisors are gonna deliver different services
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.160]   If you just want a portfolio manager
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:44:00.780]   Who's gonna do a good job go buy an active mutual fund and you can hire a perfectly good portfolio manager. You can find one
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:05.040]   If you don't need a portfolio managers go buy an index fund if you need an advisor
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.760]   So my point is and I hope this is helpful
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.800]   But you got to understand what you want what you need and that's the thing that we all need to do
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.520]   What do we want? What do we need at this stage in life now who can serve what we need?
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:21.720]   Hope this is helpful for you, but in I hope it's instructive for other people in the audience
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:26.280]   But you need to understand what you want what you need what you're trying to accomplish when you bring those things together
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.080]   Then you'll be able to create a plan
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.000]   You might be a new listener if you are go ahead and keep listening or listen to the archives
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.880]   This show is meant to be consumed in a cumulative manner
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:40.080]   So go back through the archives if you haven't and listen to past episodes
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:45.560]   But hopefully you'll come up with some ideas so that then you have a more specific question. I think it was
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.520]   Leave you with two comments. I think it two quotes. I think it was
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:57.040]   Tony Robbins who popularized the saying or at least that's I think who I heard it from if you want a better answer ask a
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.600]   Better question and I think that is the specific thing
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:07.040]   That that you need you and I both need to learn is always to ask better questions questions that are better
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:11.480]   Formulated because depending on the question that we ask that's the answer that we get
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.000]   So especially in finance, we need to ask more specific questions
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.520]   I can't possibly answer a question as general as yours because I don't know what the constraints are
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.280]   But with a set of very specific constraints then the answer becomes apparent
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:30.740]   So the key is to understand what the the question is the other quote from years ago
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:36.380]   I used to love listening to Zig Ziglar. I just loved his southern accent and his kind of down-home homespun
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:43.680]   You know thing and he used to say, you know, you got to become a meaningful specific and not a wandering generality. That's the fix here
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.460]   Every dollar should have a name and every dollar should have a goal
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:52.160]   and once you become a meaningful specific and you have goals that are specific and
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.360]   Here's what I'm trying to accomplish then all these financial questions are
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.200]   Simple and they're easy
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.880]   But as long as you're sitting here with a general question and a general goal
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.920]   Then you're gonna be batted around the financial advice industry. You're gonna be batted around from one person to another
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.160]   You're gonna be batted around from one
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.760]   You know from one
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:17.520]   Theory and philosophy and one person's gonna say buy CDs and the other person's gonna say buy index funds and the third person is gonna
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:22.440]   Say invest in real estate and the fourth person is gonna say buy fixed index annuities and the fifth person is gonna say
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.320]   Some other variation and there's a thousand more
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.240]   But once you know what you want
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.960]   The question becomes simple. Excuse me. The answer becomes simple in
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.360]   many ways
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.000]   this is all the financial planners do is we take data in and we give data out and
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.520]   All we work out is essentially a computer and then the soft skill is being able to help you understand what you want and then provide
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.560]   solutions, so I
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.280]   Wish you luck man, write back to me and let me know what you come up with. I'd be love to hear
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:58.400]   Last question comes from Joe. He says hey Joshua. My name is Joe and I'm 24 years old
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.400]   I've been listening to your show for a while now and I really enjoy it
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:07.560]   Keep up the good work. My question has to do with whether or not a Roth 401k is the right move for me
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:12.120]   Currently, my gross income is fifty eight thousand six hundred and sixteen dollars
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:17.840]   this year I've contributed six percent of my adjusted gross income into a
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:24.440]   Regular 401k and my employer matches 80 cents on the dollar up to the first 5% of my pay
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:30.400]   I also contribute to my Roth IRA and will max it out at five thousand five hundred dollars
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:35.280]   My employer just recently began offering a Roth 401k option
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:40.440]   And my question is whether or not it is the best move for me to make to begin contributing to the Roth
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.520]   versus the regular 401k
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:48.440]   I understand the tax benefits on the front end at my young age and do believe taxes will rise in the future and
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.640]   Also that I will hopefully be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than I am now
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:48:00.240]   In my mind the advantage of the Roth is the higher contribution limit eighteen thousand dollars instead of five thousand five hundred dollars
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:04.600]   But the advantage of the Roth IRA, I think you meant the Roth 401k
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.280]   I mean he did mean the Roth 401k
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:12.120]   But the advantage of the Roth IRA is that I have it at Schwab and I have lower fees and more investment options than inside
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:19.120]   My 401k I would like to keep my net take-home pay the same and I've tried and I'm having trouble running the math to figure
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:26.280]   Out which would be the better option in addition. I have the option to do a Roth 401k conversion on the twelve thousand dollars
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.840]   That's in my regular 401k your advice would be much appreciated
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:35.200]   About me. I've got twenty seven thousand in the Roth twelve thousand a 401k three thousand a taxable account
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:39.040]   Investment account six thousand a savings account and two grand and a checking account
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:46.560]   I owe forty one thousand on federal parent plus student loans at seven point six five percent and sixteen thousand five hundred dollars at
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:53.720]   Five point two five percent. I currently am on the standard repayment plan and make an extra one hundred dollar payment each month on top of that
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:58.760]   No credit card debt or any other type of loan. I own a 2005 Camry that's paid off Joe
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.520]   Joe this is uh, this is
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.080]   The question that I don't like getting more than anything else
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:10.600]   Because it's impossible for me to give a complete answer on it because I don't know enough facts
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:16.540]   And even if I did know enough facts, I still have to make a gut call on the Roth versus the non Roth scenario
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:21.240]   The reality is that if you've ever heard that this is a simple decision
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:29.080]   You've heard from someone that doesn't understand how complex this is. There are so many different variables that impact
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:37.020]   The the decision of what is right or not right in the Roth versus the traditional approach
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:41.340]   There are so many variables that the best we can do is just simply make a guess
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:45.100]   And I could toss out a dozen variables, but I'm not gonna right now
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.100]   and I mean it's everything from
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:52.580]   It's not good of me for just me to say I'm gonna I could toss out but I'm not going and then just start tossing
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.420]   out
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:50:00.060]   There are a lot of variables including income now income in the future tax brackets now tax bracket brackets in the future
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:06.660]   Marginal tax rates compression of the tax rates other taxes. Not all taxes are raised just by increasing the brackets
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:09.980]   So it's possible the brackets could be exactly the same but you know
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.900]   The the the the money the subject Social Security could be different
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:17.300]   I mean, there's so many answers to this and at some point here
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:22.580]   I've got to get the show done on this which is gonna be the comprehensive guide to Roth versus individual
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:26.680]   but the reality is it's gonna leave you at the end of it just more confused than ever and
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:32.620]   Just the fact that and less confident than ever because I've given you more data and you're gonna sit there and say, huh?
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.620]   Now I really don't know what to do
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:41.860]   The end of the day we're all just guessing and we're guessing making educated guesses
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:48.820]   But when you're 24 years old, and I'm basically got and I basically have a 76 year time horizon
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.220]   You know to get you out to age a hundred and then I've got to figure out
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.420]   Well, what what income are your kids gonna be making?
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:51:00.260]   I mean if I'm working with someone who's 60 years old and they're doing a Roth conversion and I got asked
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.620]   Well, you know your kids are your kids making a high income or a low income?
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:08.620]   Because then what assets you're gonna leave are you gonna leave behind and it's an impossible question to answer
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:15.660]   So all we do is we give some guidelines and we make some guesses and unless you know more specifics about your scenario
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.940]   So, you know, okay
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.900]   I'm in a business that it's unlikely that I'm ever gonna make a lot of money
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.900]   So now I can know that or I'm in a business
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:27.180]   What I mean is is your income gonna go up at 3% per year with cost of inflation
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:31.720]   Raises or is it gonna go up at 23% per year because you're in a highly compensated
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.420]   Field where you can improve your sales skill
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:40.820]   That's a big factor because that you know, depending on how I calculate your contributions to be that's tough
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:47.860]   I got to figure that out or are you gonna be doing any kind of early retirement strategy where I can follow some of the
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.060]   plans that that
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:49.620]   You know
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.540]   I've brought people on the show to demonstrate this where you're gonna work for 20 years and then you're gonna retire and then I can
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:58.980]   Do 0% tax Roth conversions. So anybody who says is just simple
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:03.860]   I think doesn't understand all the all the inner workings of it
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.380]   but at the end of the day just because I go round and round in circles and and
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:11.620]   You know make you think I'm smart because I give you all these different variables that doesn't help you
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:15.140]   and so at the end of the day, we just got to stick a thumb in the air and make a guess and
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:22.380]   My answer is yeah at your age 24 years old making 60 grand man. I just toss it into the Roth
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.820]   And I could be wrong
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.820]   But that would be my guess
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.620]   Hopefully you're gonna make more money. I'm a 24 years old. This should be the least you'll ever make
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:34.260]   Hopefully if you're listening to the show, you're gonna make a lot more money in the future
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:40.700]   60 grand brackets, you know, you don't say anything about family or other scenarios
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:46.220]   So reality is 60 grand of an individual. You're not married. You don't have dependents. You don't have anything like this
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:48.300]   You're gonna be you know, fairly highly taxed
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:53.300]   But it's probably gonna be less than it is in the future. So my best guess yeah go with Roth
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.380]   and
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:01.180]   It's just an educated guess and and a thumb in the air now whether you go traditional
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.940]   Excuse me put the money into the Roth 401k instead of the Roth IRA
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:10.500]   As long as you're taking as you're long as you are taking advantage of the Mac of the match
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:14.900]   Then I would
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.860]   So you've got to make sure you take advantage of the match first
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:23.700]   Going into the Roth 401k and then I would go back from that and put it in the Roth IRA
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:30.540]   And my reasoning for that is both what you said as far as okay. I've got lower fees and more investment options. That's true
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.100]   but also
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:37.620]   That you can get the money out more easily if you have need of it. I
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:42.660]   Don't know if you're married. I doubt it. You don't mention anything about that and you're 24 years old
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:48.340]   So let's say that all of a sudden you meet the girl of your dreams and you decide you're gonna buy an engagement ring
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.220]   But you don't have the money and savings you didn't plan for it
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.140]   Well if the money's in the Roth IRA
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:56.940]   You can take two you can take two grand of your contributions out and go buy the ring
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.340]   So something like that is just gonna be more flexible in the Roth IRA
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:04.040]   It's and by having it in the Roth 401k
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:09.380]   You're gonna be subject to whatever the 401k rules whatever the rules that are written on the plan are
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:15.180]   Into the raw in the Roth 401k system, so they may or may not allow a loan
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.660]   But it'd be nice to avoid it. They may or may not allow
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:24.660]   Contributions and so you just you're just gonna be more flexible if you keep it in your individual Roth IRA
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:30.900]   And I think that will help you. I'll tell you what I would do man. Get rid of that that that student loan
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:38.220]   Make sure in this what I do more in the Roth more or not and get rid of the student loan
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:42.340]   Man, I would want to get rid of this student loan you owe
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:46.740]   $41,200 on a federal student loan at
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:51.020]   7.65 percent interest you can get a guaranteed
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:55.480]   7.65 percent rate of return by paying that thing off
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:58.460]   Guaranteed
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.740]   7.65% that is healthy that is strong and
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:07.380]   Also, you can free up the cash flow which may as you're young in your career might be helpful for you
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:11.440]   You might want to transition from the career where you are now to a different career
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.660]   You might want to start a business
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:17.860]   So if you can free up the cash flow, that'll be beneficial and if you can just knock that out
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:19.860]   Remember you can't get rid of student loans
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:23.980]   They're creditor proof and excuse me. They are you can't bankrupt your way out
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:29.140]   You're always gonna have it and seven point six or five percent even five point two five percent
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.660]   I
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:35.260]   Mean if you had one of these loans that was at one and a half percent interest or two and a half percent interest
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:40.580]   I'd have to run some, you know, I'd have to think more about that. But for me my two cents
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:45.140]   Get that thing out of here seven point six five percent guaranteed rate of return
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.340]   Also increasing your flexibility
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:52.220]   You know with lower cash flow get rid of that thing
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:57.420]   That'd be what I would do and I would personally prioritize that probably over and above a bunch of money in the Roth
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:02.580]   Although I would have to think that through and you know your situation. So think that through I
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:08.620]   Think a key variable in financial planning. We don't talk about enough is flexibility and I tell you this
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:16.140]   I couldn't be doing the business that I am doing right now and taking the entrepreneurial, you know jump if I had a bunch of student loans
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.580]   Simply couldn't do it
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.580]   and
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:24.820]   So I'll take flexibility myself at a little bit of financial cost
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:31.780]   Because flexibility is life and that's the thing is is that we're doing life not math and math needs to contribute to life
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.140]   But at the end of the day these lifestyle goals and lifestyle
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.660]   Decisions have to have to be counted heavily
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:43.580]   So hope that helps I will to get this show done on at some point here soon
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:50.900]   I will get this show done on Roth versus traditional and it will leave every one of you as can more confused than you were before
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:56.300]   That's my promise, but at least you'll feel like you're a little bit more educated in a confused
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:04.380]   That's the best I could do for you how on earth do I predict political winds of change how on earth do I predict
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:06.580]   I
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.220]   Can't I have no idea?
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:11.340]   So we'll just go through a bunch of questions and then you at the end of the day
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.500]   You'll have to figure it out for yourself
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:18.340]   So that's it for my Friday show and I just thank each one every one of you for being here. I've had a great week
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:21.420]   It's been a fun week. It's been a challenging week. I've engaged

[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:33.260]   Including on Monday's show. I have enjoyed very much. I love I've got the best job in the world because
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:38.420]   when I get to do this, I mean just think about how much you get to learn from people and
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:42.820]   Think about how amazing this is the more people that you're that you're in that
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:48.380]   You know and that you meet in your life the more you learn because you get to learn from them. Well, I
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:52.100]   Get to do something like this where I've got thousands of listeners
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:56.740]   some I mean some of you guys are so you're 50 times brighter than I am and
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:59.660]   And I mean, I can't lose
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:05.020]   That's why I take the track that I do either I either either I'm right in something
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.020]   I say and I help some of you
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:12.340]   Or I'm wrong in which case I get to learn that I'm wrong and then I get to become right and so I win
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:19.140]   So I can't lose it's it's a beautiful beautiful thing. I love doing this. Thank you all so much for your support
