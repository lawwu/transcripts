[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Juggling kids, careers, and keeping life on track is no easy feat.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.520]   With two young kids of our own, we have learned firsthand how quickly priorities shift
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.720]   and how even simple tasks can feel overwhelming.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.120]   So today, my wife Amy and I are diving into the realities of parenting,
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.320]   from simplifying your finances and navigating child care,
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.440]   and sharing practical tips we've picked up along the way.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.320]   Whether you have kids or not, I really hope you enjoy hearing us
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.760]   open up about our own experiences balancing family and life.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   I'm Chris Hutchins. If you enjoyed this episode,

[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.320]   Amy, we are back. How are you feeling?
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.360]   I'm feeling good.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.920]   So the last time we did this, we didn't get a chance to cover all the topics about family,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.640]   kids. And the first question here is actually even broader than that. So you want to tee it up?
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.560]   Sure. They asked a really interesting question around optimization versus simplicity.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.560]   With two young kids, I have very little free time at the moment. And the time I have,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.320]   I'm exhausted. Hence, I haven't opened up a new credit card in a long time,
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.320]   and I've stopped tracking my expenses and net worth monthly. I imagine I'll do it again
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.040]   down the road when I have more free time. But at this stage in life, it's not a priority.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.280]   Can you relate to this with two young kids of your own? Would love to hear your reflections.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.440]   I totally relate to this. Time is the newfound finite resource. And honestly, I think about
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.920]   life before children, and I think, "Oh, wow, sometimes we had weekends where we just didn't
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.600]   do anything. We just sat at home, did nothing. We have friends that don't have kids, and that's
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.720]   what they do sometimes." And I have no idea how that life must feel. It doesn't relate to me at
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.440]   all. And what this person wrote relates to me completely. So when I think about the things
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.080]   you said, the way I try to think about it, and in some cases, I think the person who wrote this
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.680]   question, in a way, I wish that I was more like them, because I haven't been as good at sometimes
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.600]   letting go of these things that are probably not as important as maybe sleep or being more present
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.640]   in some cases. But I've also tried to find easier ways to do some of them. And so if I look back to
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.320]   the way we budgeted and tracked, and you probably remember this non-pleasantly, we would go down and
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.920]   we'd categorize all our transactions at the end of the year or the end of the quarter, and we'd run
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.040]   through the spreadsheet. And now, yes, there's more flexibility when you build your own spreadsheet
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.080]   that can do everything. But when we started using Copilot, it's like in very short one,
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.160]   two-minute intervals, I can categorize transactions when I'm going to the bathroom,
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.280]   when I'm in the line somewhere. And so that's made it easy to keep budgeting on track, have
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.680]   a good sense of how much we're spending without having to put a lot of time. Shout out to Copilot.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.520]   They've been a sponsor of the show for a while. Not as long as I've been using the app though.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   Really great product. So there are ways to do some of these things.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.960]   But when it comes to opening up new credit cards, I am aware that there are people who manage to
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.560]   open up 10, 15 cards a year and get tremendous reward for doing that. And their credit scores
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.320]   go up, and they have millions of points. And it's been in the back of my mind, just like this
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.680]   person, that we could probably do that at more velocity than we are, more than one or two cards.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.920]   And we talked about 524 in an episode. I was looking and both of us are at like 224. We could
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.040]   be doing more. But I think one of the challenges I have is that I want to get it right. It's like,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.400]   I don't want to get a new card until I figure out the sequence of all the cards that makes
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.720]   sense for everything to play out in the exact perfect and optimal way. And so I've done nothing.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   Now, the good news is I'm okay with that because I just don't have the free time
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.840]   to spend on this longer project. But I probably need to come back to the middle ground a little
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.280]   bit more satisficing of, "You know what? Getting one card is not going to change my 524 status.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.280]   I'm still going to be okay." And so maybe in the last six months that's happened, I've said,
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.680]   "Oh, here's a good opportunity." And some of it was forced. The US Bank Altitude Reserve card was
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.560]   closing, and I just had to throw it in before it went away. And so it forced my hand and I felt
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.280]   pretty good about getting forced there. Was it the best signup bonus ever? No, but I feel okay about
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.760]   it. So yes, I think I agree with a lot of this. When it comes to the simplicity side of the
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.040]   equation, that really speaks to me. I think we used to have, I don't know, seven, eight bank
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.600]   accounts, multiple brokerage accounts, lying all over the place, maybe doing bank bonuses.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.240]   And you probably at the time were like, "This is a mess." It was overwhelming. And I love the fact
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.160]   that kids have forced us to simplify in these areas because it feels like a mental decluttering
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   of having to keep track of all of these different things in addition to kids. Yeah. So now we moved
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.560]   everything to Mercury's personal account. That's great. I did a whole episode on bank accounts.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.960]   If you want to go hear what the finalists were, the short version is Wealthfront, Fidelity,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.360]   and Mercury. But if you want to go a deeper dive, check that out. I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.640]   But yeah, so managing everything in one central place, being okay with the fact that there are
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.480]   some people that want to do all their investment trades. They want to manage all the ETFs, manage
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.200]   all the tax loss harvesting, the rebalancing, because they want to save that 0.25% fee that
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.680]   you might pay to someone like a Wealthfront. I happily pay the 0.25% fee to Wealthfront to not
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.560]   have to think about it. It's a very small fraction of the cost of the returns of the portfolio.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.200]   And if you look at the last, I don't know, 10 years, if I hadn't been able to make the decisions
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.520]   I did and invest like I did because I was worried about the fee or the fee kept me from tax loss
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.280]   harvesting, I would not be in a better position today, even net adjusted of all those fees.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.680]   So those things are great. A couple other fun simplicity things that we added just as inspiration
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.680]   when it comes to food. Before kids, we used to go out all the time, we'd make our decisions
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.960]   last minute, we wouldn't plan that much. And that was fun. I love trying new restaurants.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.000]   Now, we do Taco Tuesday, we do Pizza Friday, and it just adds a little bit of simplicity to the
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.360]   week. Yes, there are still five days of the week we have to figure out what we're doing. But there
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.760]   are two we do not. And I think that even though there's a previous version of us that would have
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.960]   rather had more variety, having a little bit of headspace back and finding recipes that aren't
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.720]   the most creative wild recipes that, you know, take three hours of prep, but are things we can
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.280]   whip up in 15 minutes and we really like that level of simplicity. I really appreciate it.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.880]   Yeah, I completely agree. I think the word you used was "satisfying" and that couldn't be
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.360]   more accurate in the way that we are approaching life at the moment with two young kids.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.280]   Okay, next question. Justin asked for just general parenting advice.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.120]   I'm gonna let you start this one. This is a very interesting question because
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.920]   it's quite broad, but it also assumes that we have any area of expertise. I think most parents
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.200]   are kind of crash course testing their way through parenting just like we are. There are a few things
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.840]   that I think have worked for us that I'll call out. There have been moments where we're like,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.600]   "Man, we have really figured out parenting. Things are just feeling really smooth and
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.640]   everything's humming along." And it feels like just as you start to really nail parenting,
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.440]   everything changes. The developmental phases, the...
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.600]   Sleep regressions.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.760]   Sleep regressions, just variables in your external kind of kids' worlds that you can't
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.240]   control change. And now you're dealing with a whole new set of interesting challenges. So
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.360]   I think all this to say, just when you think you know it, turns out you don't know it.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.680]   And you're having to relearn everything all over again in a very different way. And so I think
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.120]   that's very normal and something that we've learned to accept over time.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.760]   Yeah. One thing I'll add there is that I think every time something goes wrong or doesn't go
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.400]   the way you thought, it's like, "Oh, the kids were sleeping great. And then today they didn't."
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.280]   You can ask yourself a million questions to try to figure out why.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.160]   And the advice I've gotten from parents who've done this more than we have for longer than we have
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.640]   is that don't try to explain it. Sometimes we're like, "Oh, well, we gave them green beans. And
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.760]   then they didn't sleep well. Was it the green beans?" Or like, "What was it? What caused this
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.360]   thing? Is it that they're getting sick? Is it that she was upset that I didn't spend enough
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.520]   minutes with her this afternoon after work because I was a little distracted on this deadline?"
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.600]   And you can blame a million things for what happened. But it turns out, and we're now four
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.800]   years into this, sometimes it just happens. Sometimes your kid doesn't sleep well for no
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.600]   reason. Sometimes your kid's in a bad mood for no reason. And that's not to say there aren't
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:30.160]   reasons. Sometimes your kid is sick. Sometimes there are issues. But trying to explain every
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.840]   time something doesn't go correctly can send you down a path of worrying about way too much.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.000]   And I feel like we've both experienced that a lot.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.880]   Yeah. I would definitely say I fall victim to that more than you do.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.560]   But you're right. Kids are kids. The answer is kids. And that's why. They're a kid. And that
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:56.640]   happens. One of the other things I would mention is for our kids, I found it to be really helpful
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.200]   in trying to approach some of the challenges that they're experiencing from a place of curiosity.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.960]   One of the examples that I experienced was our four-year-old resisting going to school.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.760]   She really just fought it. She did not want to go into the classroom. She was not excited when
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.840]   she'd wake up knowing it was a school day. So instead of trying to quickly fix the problem,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.520]   we approached her from a place of curiosity, just trying to understand more the behavior.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.600]   So help us understand why don't you want to go to school? What's happening right now? Tell me more.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.680]   And I think what we realized is not that she didn't like school. She was actually
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.960]   bored. She didn't feel like she was being challenged. And that really allowed us to
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:47.040]   figure out ways that we could help integrate some of that into her next school year to ensure that
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.680]   she was feeling challenged in the right way. And now she loves school. So I think approaching it
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.400]   from a place of curiosity as opposed to any kind of judgment and having that open mind allows
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.880]   us and her to really collaborate and come up with a solution together.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.760]   Yeah. And one thing that you taught me was getting down on their level. And so
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.880]   when you're having these conversations with your younger children, it's like, "Oh, we want to talk
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.360]   about how your day's going. We want to talk about what's wrong." Get down on the ground and be a
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.520]   peer of theirs instead of standing up. Sometimes just looming over them can put their defenses up
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.760]   a lot. And just getting down on their level, being calm, and talking to them can really open them up
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.800]   a lot and break that hierarchy that comes from you being the parent standing over them.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.560]   And so I totally agree there. I think one thing that I'll add that is hard, and I think every
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:46.000]   parent agrees with this, and we did an episode on making time in your day, and this was a theme
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.800]   there. And it keeps coming up as just trying to have time where you're present and time where
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:57.680]   you're not and splitting that off. And so instead of working all day and then coming to dinner and
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.520]   working during dinner, I'd say it's probably better to be at dinner 100% there and then go
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:07.200]   back and work later. And so trying to make the time you spend with your kids fully on with the
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.640]   kids. And it's amazing how much we've heard comments when we haven't adhered to that,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.360]   where they're like, "When are you going to be off your phone? What's so exciting on there?"
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.880]   And so we just have been trying to get better. I think one thing that helps is on days when we're
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.840]   not at the house all day, my phone's dead. And so when I come home, I charge it. And I notice I'm
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.760]   like, "Oh, I was really present with the kids because my phone is on the charger." And so we
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.880]   put two of those magnetic phone chargers in the kitchen as just like, "Oh, when you're in the
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.040]   kitchen, you get to charge your phone. So your battery's full and you have that going into the
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.120]   evening." And so that's kind of helped. It's like a little hack of set up two chargers in the
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.920]   kitchen so that when you're in the living area or in your living room to pay on your house is laid
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.600]   out so that you have your phones away and you can be more present with the kids. Anything else on
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:02.640]   your list? I also think that creating a judgment-free zone is really helpful because particularly when
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.080]   they're young, they might do something really silly and it might feel like a very small thing.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.840]   But if you remain really open-minded and judgment-free for the small things,
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:19.280]   I think over time, then when big things actually come up, they'll feel a lot more open to sharing
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:25.920]   those things as well. And so it kind of manifests in a really progressive, strong way over time.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.200]   So as much as we can, as parents, try to be judgment-free, I think that's a huge positive
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.400]   for the kids. Another thing that I had on my list was having time with each kid one-on-one.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.720]   And we've instituted this recently where we'd split off and I'll take one girl for a date,
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   you take another girl for a date at night. And whether that's at night for dinner,
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.800]   whether that's an activity, whether that's going to Costco, sometimes buying gold,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.720]   things like that with your kids, I think is really important.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.520]   And I think something we want to really keep doing regularly.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:06.800]   Yeah. I think that's huge because I definitely noticed that they are a lot calmer and just have
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:13.920]   a better kind of mentality day after day when we spend that quality time. And if we skip it for
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   several days in a row, it does feel like we start to see them act out a little bit beyond what their
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.120]   standard kind of behavior is. And another way we do it just more
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:28.320]   simply than even going out is we'll each take a different kid every other night and do bedtime.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.160]   So there's just a little bit of one-on-one time. Obviously, we still go out and do tons of
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.480]   activities together as a family, but we do try to make sure we do a little one-on-one time like that.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.080]   It's not just important to spend one-on-one time with each child. I think it's also important
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.000]   to make sure you're carving out one-on-one time for each other if you have
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.440]   a partner, because it's really valuable for your kids to see that being a huge priority.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.640]   And I think it also helps parents go at raising children in more of a unified way.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.760]   Yeah. I think we regularly do date nights. And when our children say, "No, don't leave. Don't
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.360]   leave." We say, "It's important for mommy and daddy to have some time together too,
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.320]   just like you get to go on dates with mommy and daddy. And just like we have mommy and
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:14.480]   daddy play days, we need to spend time together." And I think I often hear some parents two, three,
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.520]   four years into having children that say, "Gosh, we haven't taken a date yet." And so we'll talk
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.520]   about childcare a little bit later, but I think it's really important. And I'm glad we've made
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.720]   time for that. I agree.

[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.520]   So this next question is from Tyler. My wife is a little over three months pregnant with our first
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.560]   baby. Congrats, Tyler. And we have some time to prepare, but I still feel like I have no idea
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.640]   what to do. What are some things you both did to prepare for the baby? And maybe what are some
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.120]   things you didn't do, but now looking back, wish you had known or done? This is a really good
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.640]   question for you because I feel like you created a notion page and you just really got after it.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.400]   Yeah. So for context, this podcast was originally potentially going to be a parenting podcast.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.120]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.320]   I went really deep down building out this new baby planning notion and registry,
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.480]   you know, childcare options, birth plan, everything. I was just really excited.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.680]   Stroller comparisons, spreadsheets, the whole thing.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.040]   Yeah. I wish strollers didn't change so much because I have this amazing spreadsheet. I'll
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.440]   link to it in the show notes, but I don't know how out of date it is. But I went deep on a lot
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.160]   of these things. So I'll share some of what was in there because I went back and looked at it.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.680]   But when it comes to how to prepare, you know, as a mother being pregnant,
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.520]   I've got nothing and I'll defer to you. But one thing that I thought was really helpful,
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:39.040]   and this is probably broadly true anytime your partner is going into any surgery. I know when
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:45.520]   you had your recent surgery, it was also valuable. It's just understand what your partner wants out
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.280]   of that experience because sometimes there are decisions that have to be made and your partner
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:58.320]   might be on a lot of drugs and might not be in the most coherent state or be thinking the way
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.000]   they want. So have a plan in advance of what you want. Whether that's a birth plan or you just
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.200]   actually know, you don't have to formalize it in any way. That's important. I think also
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.920]   understanding what your insurance covers. Our insurance covered a doula and having a doula
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.440]   at the birth. So that was really cool. Lots of people I know have done that and didn't know
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.800]   their insurance covered it. Also, once you have your child, you have a life event and you can
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.680]   change your insurance. So not only thinking about what is your insurance cover for the birth,
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.240]   but what is your insurance cover once you have children and do you want to use having children
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.920]   as an opportunity to change your insurance plans for the year? If you have FSAs or HSAs and you
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.000]   want to use them the year you're having a birth, if there's going to be a big expense with that,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.560]   depending on your plan, that's something to consider. Thinking about childcare,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.440]   what are you going to do after this baby comes? You may have time off. One perspective I have,
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.440]   and I'd be curious to get your thoughts, and then I'll finish this list, is when we were
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.000]   thinking about taking time off, we originally thought about staggering it where you would
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.040]   take three months and I would take three months. That was probably from a place of saving money,
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.200]   where it was like we would maximize the number of months we would have where we didn't need
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.160]   to hire any help to take care of the kids so we could both be working. But I'm really glad
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:19.040]   we didn't do that because I think it was good to both have some overlapping time in those early
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:25.200]   months. But I'm curious what you think. I seem to recall we actually did test it
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:34.080]   for a very short period of time in the first few weeks. I think the takeaway from my perspective
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:40.000]   was as much as we wanted to optimize you going straight back to work and my spending time with
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.880]   the baby first, and then later I go back and then you take time off to be with the baby,
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.040]   it was really hard. And I think particularly early on, it's like you assume everything is just
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:57.120]   going to be normal life but with a baby that sleeps a lot. And the reality of it is that
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:04.400]   the emotional demands, you just don't expect it in the way that it actually pans out.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.840]   And so I think what had happened is we tested it for a few weeks and I got to a point where I was
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   like, "This is not working. So why don't we see if you can actually take some paid time off now?"
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.440]   And we then ended up sharing some overlap there. And that was actually really nice because it was
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.160]   really good family bonding time and allowed us both a bit of reprieve in those moments
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.800]   that we weren't expecting to need it, but we did. So I love the optimization mindset that
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:36.000]   we went in with. But I think the reality was just very different than what we had planned.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.400]   I also think now that you say this, people say early parenting is kind of a blur. And now I'm
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.960]   like, "Oh yeah, actually now I remember part of this." One thing that I also realized was there
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:52.960]   was one week, I think, where I tested in some way, I was like 100% on. And I realized being 100% on
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:21:02.160]   is a lot. Being a full-time childcare caregiver for one child and even more if it's two the next
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:09.360]   time, is just a really hard thing. And so I think we both realized, you alluded to that also, but
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:18.720]   I would rather spend the money to be able to go back to work after three months and have the first
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.840]   three months be both of us. And so very appreciative that we even had that time off because I know not
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.680]   everyone does. But I now remember that I was like, "Wow, if I wait three months and then you go back
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.200]   to work, I'm 100% on for three months straight." And that might be harder than I thought. And I
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.800]   think the early glimpses I got at it were that it might be. So... It's hard.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.160]   Let's see, a few other things. So figuring out that childcare once whatever parental leave you
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.360]   have is over is really important. There's both the childcare that you might want right after
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:54.880]   giving birth. There are a handful of options, family members, taking time off. There are
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.960]   night nurses and night nannies. There are baby nurses, which are more full-time,
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:07.200]   more popular on the East Coast. There is different forms of live-in help, especially a lot of
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:15.600]   Asian cultures have this concept of a period of time, maybe it's three weeks to 30 days or longer.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.960]   Often the grandmother or the mother of the mother will come and take care of mom and the baby to
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:27.760]   give mom time to recover. We actually ended up finding a Korean agency that set up a service
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.240]   like that. And I'll put a link to it in the show notes if anyone's interested. But it was a really,
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.360]   really interesting experience. It was kind of of the ilks of us loving this cultural exchange
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.360]   of having different people and cultures in our home. So we had someone come in and live with us
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.840]   for the first, I think, three weeks. And it was a very different experience. She didn't speak
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.560]   English very well. So there was a little bit of a communication barrier. But at the end of the day,
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.280]   the baby doesn't speak English either, right? So showing someone how to wash a baby, you could just
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.840]   watch and see how that works. And so that was really, really helpful for those first few weeks.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.400]   I realized how fortunate we were to be able to do that. But also just asking your parents what
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.440]   their intention is. Some people find out their parents are planning to come and stay with them
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.240]   for a few weeks, whether they ask for it or not. And some people might ask for it and find out
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:20.080]   their parents are not interested. I think both of our parents wanted to come and visit and be a
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:26.000]   little helpful, but neither of them had any intention on moving in and helping for any period
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.200]   of time more than a few days. And so be upfront and ask about that is important. A couple other
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.520]   quick ones. There's this thing called cord banking, where you can take the umbilical cord and kind of
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.320]   bank it for some future use case. We didn't do this. But I do remember they asked us at the
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.440]   hospital if we were going to do it. But had you not decided beforehand, you couldn't. You needed
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.680]   to come with, I don't know, some kit to put it in or something. And so if you want to do that,
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.200]   you want to figure that out in advance after your kid's born, getting their social security number,
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.600]   getting their passport. If you want to do global entry, go get their global entry appointment.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.680]   All those things need to happen if you want to travel at any point in time. Another one is just
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:07.520]   figuring out what your plan is in case something happens to you or your partner. And so making sure
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.640]   you have a will, making sure you figure out who your guardian is, making sure you figure out
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.120]   if you have enough assets and you want to avoid probate, you could go for the full estate plan.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:24.080]   And so shout out to Trust and Will, which is who we use to set up our will and estate plan and
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.920]   all that. And since doing that, we have brought on as a partner on the show. That's something
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.040]   important, especially because I think it's obvious to some people who the guardian of their children
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.840]   might be. And then as you start thinking about it from the perspective of, "Oh, well, who do I think
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.880]   will raise these children in the way that we want to raise these children?" That question might not
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.240]   be the person you initially thought. And so that's one that took a little bit of time.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.200]   Couple quick ones. Updating your withholding. You can now change your withholding. You might have
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:57.120]   lower tax withholding because you have dependents. Life insurance. Having a child is a great time to
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.840]   think about life insurance. I am really a fan of term life insurance. I'm not a fan of all other
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.040]   life insurances. And another partner that we reached out to was Fabric, which is a great
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.200]   place to go get term life insurance. And you can do it all from home. You might not even have to
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.360]   do a doctor's appointment. So check out the show notes there. Let's see. Finding a pediatrician,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:20.800]   because you usually have doctor's appointments days after the hospital. And so some people end
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.040]   up not thinking about that and then scrambling. If you want to figure out and be intentional about
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.720]   who your children's doctor will be, you can figure that out in advance. Only other thing is,
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.680]   don't go overboard on your registry. I think sometimes you can buy all this stuff and then
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.880]   either not need it. I don't know how many burp claws and bibs we had that we didn't use.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:44.160]   So I would say there's an endless supply of things you can have. For most people listening,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:50.160]   I imagine you can, within a 30-minute drive or Amazon same day, next day, get almost anything
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.640]   you need. So I wouldn't go too overboard there. I don't know. That was a lot. But those are all
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.440]   the things on my notion list. You have anything else to add there? Yeah. Those were all really
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:06.000]   great. If I think about what was on our registry and what we ended up getting versus what we used,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.280]   we maybe used 60% to 70% of all the baby stuff we got. And we ended up giving away
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.560]   in brand new condition, in boxes, a lot of the stuff that we had purchased and/or been gifted,
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:24.080]   because you just don't need the things you think you might need. And every baby is kind of
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:31.280]   different also. So I'm definitely a huge advocate of going at it in a minimalistic nature at first.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.520]   And then once you figure out what you need, quickly acquiring those things,
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.960]   whether it's driving to the store or getting it shipped to you overnight.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.080]   This is a tip from you, but I don't know if you're going to remember it. So I will share it.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.960]   Write some of these things down. I was so blown away when we had our second daughter,
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:54.480]   we were like, "Hmm, what did we do about writing down how often they went to the bathroom? Did
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.800]   we write those things down? What do we do about when we start feeding them certain types of food?"
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.600]   All of these things that we thought, "Well, of course, we'll remember this." We didn't remember
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.320]   any of it. It was a total blur about the dates and times these things happened.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.840]   So anytime there's a milestone or anytime you did a little bit of research on
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.240]   how to figure out how to help with sleep, how to do really anything, I would encourage you,
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.080]   if you think you might have other children, to just set up an OceanPage, set up something,
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.320]   and start writing those things down. Yeah, that's such a good call out.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.960]   I think the other thing that I would mention is looking back, I think one of the things I wish we
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:40.320]   had changed is we went deep down research rabbit holes and preparing for a baby. And I don't think
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:47.040]   I fully appreciated, nor did you, the idea of being able to relax, of being able to sleep in,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.800]   of being able to do things when you wanted to. And once you have a kid, that all goes out the
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.120]   window. So I would definitely encourage any expecting parents, especially if it's your
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:05.040]   first one, take time for yourself. It feels maybe uncomfortable, but it is so, so valuable because
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:11.200]   you'll never get that time in the same way back for decades probably. And then the other thing is,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:17.600]   I think we did a bunch of research up front. And I think that research was valuable. But a lot of
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:24.640]   the research and learnings that we did six months before the baby was born was then done at 2am in
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.840]   the morning when we were actually having the problem. And we were going down these rabbit
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.400]   holes of research trying to understand what was happening because we were desperate at that time.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   And so it was almost like we were relearning a lot of the stuff that we'd already kind of
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.600]   done the legwork around. But desperate times call for desperate measures. You're going to end up
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:51.280]   re-googling or re-chat GPT-ing everything that you are already learning now. So I would say just
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.120]   wait until you actually need it and then go deep down those rabbit holes because you will,
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.640]   whether you want to or not. It's funny you say chat GPT-ing and I realized chat GPT wasn't around
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.400]   when we had our first child. So kudos to you parents who now have access to this resource
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.480]   that can much more quickly give you answers to things. They might not always be the right answer,
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.360]   but it's something that I wish we had. The only other thing I'll add here is that in those early
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.760]   days, I will say as your children get older, first it gets a little harder to get around,
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.520]   then it gets easier. But those first few six months, we were right in the middle of the
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.840]   pandemic. So we didn't really get to take advantage of this. But there's a window of
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.640]   time where your kid will sleep anywhere, on your chest, sleep in a stroller, sleep in almost every
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:39.760]   way, shape or form. And it's a magical time that I see people post-pandemic or pre-pandemic where
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:44.560]   they are able to go on little adventures, whether they're local or whether they're to the beach or
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:49.200]   somewhere where it's just a lot easier. Because once your kids are running around and wanting to
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:55.360]   crawl and not napping as much, it's just a lot harder. And then it gets easier. We're seeing now
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:00.320]   with our kids, one's done napping, one's almost done napping, both out of diapers. It's actually
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:07.040]   starting to get easier again. But those first six months were actually also easy in terms of
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.240]   your kid can sleep anywhere. You're not worried about feeding them whatever you're having at the
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.920]   dinner table and whether they're throwing stuff around and not eating the food and throwing
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.080]   ketchup on their face or whatever it is. And so find a way to enjoy that time.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:27.040]   Yeah, it's a great point. And it just speaks to all the different phases that the children and
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:33.360]   the parents need as they grow. And so actually, one of the questions that came in was around
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:39.440]   childcare. And that's changed from us from when the baby was three months versus when the child
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.800]   is 1, 2, 5, 10. And so someone wrote in a question and asked, "How did you think about
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.560]   childcare options? And what led you to decide on an au pair?"
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:54.240]   So this is an interesting one, because I had four or five au pairs as a kid. And so had I
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.640]   not had that experience, I don't even know if I would have known what an au pair was. So I've
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.920]   actually gotten some feedback from people in person that didn't know what an au pair was.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:07.200]   They're like, "Gosh, it sounds so fancy. It sounds like so expensive in this very elite thing."
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.040]   I was like, "Really? Can I tell you more about it?" Because it's actually not that at all.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:16.080]   Now, yes, you do need more means to have childcare. But on the spectrum of childcare
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:22.880]   options, it's certainly not the most expensive version of childcare. And so I think naturally,
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.520]   as we did, we were like, "Let's explore all the options." Just because I had an au pair as a child
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.440]   isn't like, "Oh, we have to have this thing." So we actually did compare all the options.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.640]   We looked at nannies. We looked at daycare. We looked at Montessori kindergartens that start
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.840]   really young. We looked at au pairs. And we looked at multiple au pair agencies.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:46.240]   We interviewed some nannies. We kind of tried to cover the entire spectrum
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.800]   and understand pros and cons of everything. And are there some tricks here?
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.520]   One fun trick for daycare was a lot of daycares are full, right? You try to get in and they're
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.640]   like, "We don't have any space." And so someone told me, "Look, sometimes they only have space
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.920]   one or two days a week. So even if you want five days a week, start with the one or two days a week.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.840]   And then when another day opens up, they usually give it to the people who are going part-time.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.400]   So if you want to quickly get your way into full-time, don't wait for the five-day-a-week
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.040]   option. Take a limited day." So that was one thing. So we looked at all of these. And I think
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:23.440]   we really settled on the au pair program because it was really interesting. So I'll let you talk a
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:30.000]   little bit about why. But for a little context, the way this program works is someone from another
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.560]   country spends one year and potentially up to a second year in the US on what's called a cultural
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:42.640]   exchange. And there's actually a Department of State-issued visa for cultural exchange similar
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.680]   to a student visa in that they're not allowed to go get jobs in the United States and be fully
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:53.440]   employed, but they are allowed to come. And the trade-off that is part of this cultural exchange
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:33:00.480]   is you provide room and board, and they provide childcare for up to 45 hours a week. And there
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:06.160]   are some very specific rules and restrictions on how that works. They can't work for more than 10
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.720]   hours straight. And you need to give them a weekend off. And I won't go through every single
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:16.560]   one of the rules. But it ends up being a very, very flexible program. And from a cost standpoint,
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.920]   depending on how many children you have, it's probably one of the most affordable options of
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.120]   all forms of childcare with the understanding that you're giving up a room in your house
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:32.960]   to someone that's living in your house. And for us, and the experiences I had as a child,
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.680]   and we've now had, I love that. I love that we get to expose our kids to people from other
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.480]   countries. But there is a cost. If you don't have an extra bedroom, it's just not an option for you.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.680]   But we have actually talked to some friends who realized that if they're renting a place
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.520]   with two bedrooms, renting a place with a third bedroom would cost more, but would actually,
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.320]   in the long run, be cheaper than having a two-bedroom with a nanny and a three-bedroom
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.640]   with an au pair. They actually saved money in that perspective. So something to consider.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.120]   But why don't you talk a little bit about why we ended up doing this?
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:09.600]   There were so many upsides to having an au pair and being part of that program that I think
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.160]   ultimately, it just made so much sense. And that's why we ended up going up that route.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:19.920]   So a few things that became super interesting for me were one, the personalized care,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:28.320]   and the fact that I think I had a very clear parenting or caregiving style that I wanted
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:35.680]   implemented with my children, and we did, is something that having an au pair live with you,
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.760]   they're not only starting to adopt the way that you like things done,
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:45.200]   but even when they're not working, they're experiencing the way that you interact and
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:51.520]   engage with your children. And so it's a lot easier for them to quickly kind of align and
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:57.840]   adopt some of the different parenting philosophies that we had. And I think that was really,
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:04.560]   really important. I think the other thing that was really helpful is obviously what we were looking
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:12.720]   for with a six-month-old baby was very different at the time than what we are looking for today.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.000]   Right? And it's great that through the same program year after year, you can take a step
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.760]   back and reassess, "Okay, what do we need for our kids or our family this year?" And we can go out
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:30.080]   and look for those specific traits. So early on, it was good energy and someone who's able to
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:37.520]   verbalize and communicate and use language and music and play with our baby. And now with one
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.200]   being in school, one being very part-time, someone who is actually willing to take on more of that
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.560]   educational element and is really invested in early childhood education is really important.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.400]   And so that's what we've been able to find through the program. We've primarily done all of our
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.720]   searching with CulturalCare, the agency we've used for all five au pairs. In the early days,
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.960]   we did explore some of the other agencies. But if we talk about features, I don't want to promise
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.600]   that they exist for all au pair agencies, but they definitely exist for CulturalCare,
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.440]   which is who we used. And one thing, we didn't talk about this process, but when you're looking
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.400]   for an au pair, you can go and browse hundreds of profiles, maybe thousands of profiles.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.880]   And so you mentioned we were looking for these different things. So in the process,
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:24.080]   it's almost in a way like a dating app where you're filtering for things or a recruiting site.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.000]   We were like, "Okay, we're looking for someone. You could choose the country." If it's really
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.720]   important for your kids to learn Portuguese, you can focus on certain places. If it's really
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.640]   important for your children to learn Spanish, you can focus on Spanish-speaking countries.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.280]   If you really need someone who's a really strong swimmer, or you need someone who has a lot more
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.440]   experience driving, or whatever the factors you're looking for are, there's an app, you can download
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.480]   it on your phone, and you can start browsing profiles and starting to watch videos and read
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.320]   descriptions and see what kind of educational background people have, personality traits,
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:02.160]   those kinds of things. And so for us, over the years, we've gotten really attuned to what we're
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.480]   looking for, what's important for our family. And for some people, they might want more
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.640]   spontaneity. Some people might want someone that's very neat and organized. And those are
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.760]   all things that you can drill down on, and then interview someone and have some video calls.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.720]   Which I'm laughing because my parents did this before video calls. And so they just had a piece
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.160]   of paper and a photo. And they're like, "Great, we'll have this person live with us for a year."
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.840]   We've been fortunate to have like four or five video calls and get to know someone and maybe
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:33.760]   meet their parents and all that kind of stuff. So I think throughout the process, it's not like
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.000]   we want this and someone shows up on your door, you've gotten a chance to talk to 10, 12 people,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.440]   whatever the right number is for you, and find someone that you think is really going to be a
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:47.120]   good fit. The other thing that I have really appreciated about the program is the flexibility
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:55.600]   that you get. And so it's not like set hours, every single week, week after week, that we found
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:02.240]   to be asked more prevalently with nannies. We're able to change the schedule weekly,
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:08.560]   daily, if needed. And it's nice because you have such a close working relationship
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.320]   with the au pair because they live with you, they're integrated into your family,
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.040]   such that it becomes a lot easier to say, "Oh, hey, you know, we have this big thing coming up."
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.560]   Or, "Hey, it looks like our daughter is coming down to something. So we might need to change
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.000]   the hours for tomorrow because she might not be going to school or whatever it might be."
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.520]   And so there's an added layer of flexibility because they're just way more in tune with
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.680]   what's happening in the family. And because they may be sitting down having dinner with you the
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:42.240]   night before, they get a little bit of visibility into the next day. And so that's been a huge win
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:47.600]   for us, particularly when things become more demanding, either personally or professionally.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.960]   Yeah. And because they're part of the family, we bring our au pair on vacations.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.880]   So from a flexibility standpoint, when we went to Hawaii, yes, there was an added cost,
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:02.560]   we got another room, but we also had her with us. And so we try really hard when we're on these
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:07.520]   vacations to make sure that they also get to go explore. So they're not working a full week.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.880]   So every one of our au pairs has been like, "Hawaii is the best place. We've been able to
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.640]   bring them. They love it." But then there's also been a couple days where in one case,
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.040]   I was at a conference. In one case, we wanted to just have a date and go explore. And so we've
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:24.400]   been able to do that. So whether it's date nights or weekends or evenings, we've been able to have
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:30.160]   that flexibility even while traveling, which is something that I think is really different about
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:35.760]   having an au pair versus a nanny or daycare, where it's a lot harder to have weekend support.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.840]   Your daycare is not going on vacation with you. And so if you are looking for an au pair,
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   obviously, we've had a great experience with Cultural Care. They're the largest agency
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:48.240]   in the country. I think they have the best search. I know they're doing background checks.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.760]   They have a great mobile app. They have local coordinators called LCCs around. So one of the
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:59.600]   nice things is you're not the only person there to support this person in a new country. There's a
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.840]   person especially for that. And I think one of the great things about having a big agency is
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.560]   that the other au pairs in that agency are also around. And so there is a community for that
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.400]   person. So one of the biggest things that I've heard people say is, "Gosh, do we have this person
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.120]   living in our house all the time?" Well, it turns out, as most of us remember from when we were
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.440]   around 20-something years old, we didn't want to sit at home all day. We wanted to go out with
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:26.640]   friends and we want to go see people and do things. And so that community exists from other au pairs
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.880]   and from that local coordinator. So huge shout out to Cultural Care. We actually reached out to them
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:35.840]   earlier this year and said, "You guys have been a fantastic agency for us. We're going to talk
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.680]   about childcare. We have lots of parents listening. Do you guys want to be a partner?" And they said,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.160]   "Yes." And so thank you to them for being a sponsor of this episode and of the show.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.680]   For anyone listening, you can get $250 off if you join as a new host family,
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.080]   your first au pair experience. You can do that at allthehacks.com/culturalcare.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:41:02.160]   And just because Cultural Care is a partner of ours now doesn't mean that an au pair is
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.840]   necessarily the right fit for every family. For us, it's been nothing short of amazing. And I can't
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:13.360]   imagine having to send my child to daycare or having an outside nanny to manage, but every
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.800]   family is different. So just make sure you're going through that assessment.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.880]   Yep. Again, allthehacks.com/culturalcare. I'll put a link in the show notes.

[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:16.640]   peace of mind we have knowing that we got all of this taken care of and it was so easy to update

[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.920]   All right. Next question. We've been talking about child care. Let's talk a little bit about
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.160]   school. Omar says, "With your girls going to school, you'll face the same question regarding
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.440]   public versus charter versus private. What are your thoughts there?"
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.480]   This is something that we've actually been thinking a lot about as our daughter approaches
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:58.320]   kindergarten next year and I think there are so many pros and cons to both and it really boils
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:03.680]   down to two things in my mind. One, what is the financial situation? What is our financial
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   situation? And two, what are the needs of the child? Are there specific needs and/or support
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:20.000]   that they should have in order to accelerate or thrive in school? And those would be the two
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:27.120]   big ways that I think about assessing private versus public. What are some of the things you
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.880]   think about? Yeah. I didn't read the full question Omar wrote, but one of them was like, "We've been
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.360]   thinking about private and we wonder if the money can be better spent elsewhere." So I think one big
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:41.760]   question before you even have to consider this is, do you have the financial resources to make this
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:47.360]   work? I don't think the upside of a school that costs money, a private school, or if there's a
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.280]   charter school that has fees is worth putting yourself into debt and all that. So let's just
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:56.160]   put that aside. But then if you do have the resources, are they worth it? It would really
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.800]   come down to, well, what is the trade-off? Is this you have so much money under the sun,
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:06.240]   that trade-off is whether you leave more inheritance or is this you can't take vacations
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.320]   as a family? And I think that's going to be so different for every family that it's really hard
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:16.720]   to give a blanket statement. I think you are probably going to get more personalized education
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:22.640]   for your children at a private school. But I don't know, we both went to public elementary
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.520]   school as kids. I will say in some parts of the country where I grew up, there was a gifted and
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:32.640]   talented program. In some parts of the country, there are magnet schools and charter schools that
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.520]   are part of the public program. In California, to my knowledge, we don't have any of those things.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:42.560]   And so I think another, like you mentioned, important factor is your own child's individual
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:48.800]   learning. And so if your child is struggling or really excelling, you might not get anything to
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:54.640]   support that as much at a public school. I actually would say there's probably more resources for
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.120]   people who are a little bit behind than people who are ahead, at least in our school district
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:04.400]   from what we've learned. But again, case-by-case basis. And I think at the end of the day,
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.720]   there are so many options for something in the middle of that.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:14.640]   Yeah. I think one of the discussions I recall us having more recently was if we put our child
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:20.720]   into public school, you get more of that local community vibe and you really get to know your
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.880]   neighbors because everyone is going to that school. And you can support it with some of
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:30.240]   these supplemental programs, reading, math, language, whatever that might be. But you as
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:36.800]   a parent are responsible for coordinating, paying, and planning all of those extracurriculars to
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:43.600]   further support your child's needs. Whereas I think on the private side, you're paying upfront
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:51.200]   for it, but you don't have to do the same level of extracurricular research and planning because
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.480]   hopefully they're getting a little bit more of that in the classroom itself. But again, then
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:02.640]   it's more expensive and you don't have the same kind of tight-knit neighborhood community as you
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:08.160]   would sending them to public. So I don't know that there's necessarily a right answer. I think it
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:15.040]   really depends on what you value most. And to your point, Chris, where do those resources go
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:19.680]   if they're not going to public or private? And what strain would it put on your family?
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:24.160]   I would say if you have to take a second job to be able to afford private school, and that means
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.080]   you're not home a lot and you don't get to spend time with your kids and one of the parents isn't
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:33.200]   around as much, I don't know. I can't speak to every situation, but that seems to be a trade-off
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.840]   that I would really, really think twice about before making. Obviously, every child has different
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:42.560]   needs so I can't speak to everyone, but I think you really got to think about those trade-offs.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:49.200]   And I have met people that have done amazing things in private school and public school.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.520]   I went to public school and private school. My sister didn't. We both turned out great.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:58.640]   Well, it's interesting too, because Emily Oster in one of the books that she has goes deep into
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:05.840]   research and data around parenting. And the single biggest factor she said that influences
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:10.560]   children's success is actually what happens at home and the relationship and the amount
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:16.880]   of time you spend with your child at home, which to me then leads me to conclude that,
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:23.680]   yeah, education is definitely super important, but it's not the single biggest factor to a child's
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:30.320]   success or failure. And so I think it's good to remember kids are super resilient and whether
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:36.640]   they end up in public or private, what happens at home is probably going to be one of the bigger
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:41.040]   determining factors of their success. If you're listening to this and you're years away from
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.680]   having children, first off, I'd be surprised if you made it this far. But if you did, I know that
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.680]   in a lot of parts of the country, there are districts that have better schools and worse
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:55.040]   schools. And so sometimes people pay a premium to live in a district with a good school district
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.040]   and then end up deciding they wanted to send their kids to private school. If you think you
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:04.480]   might be on the fence about something like that, it's not crazy to rent for a couple of years and
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:09.600]   see where that nets out if that's something that works with your lifestyle. Because I can say
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:16.560]   we have friends who have done both. They've decided to move to a school district that
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.760]   had really great public schools and took advantage of that. And then we have friends
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:24.960]   that have paid the premium for a house in a school district with really great public schools,
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.880]   decided to send their kid to private school, and they probably would have saved a lot of money on
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.920]   their home if they had bought a home probably even closer to that private school, but it was
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.320]   in a district that didn't have as great schools. And also, school ratings are really interesting.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:43.680]   And I've learned from a few people that really understand school rating that they really come
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:49.600]   down to a lot of things that aren't always about the school. So it might be more related to test
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:55.680]   scores. And if you live in a school district with a bunch of affluent families, they might supplement
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:02.880]   that school as much as is necessary with outside tutoring, outside education, parent involvement,
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.800]   such that the school might look like it's incredible because the kids get great test scores,
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:11.040]   but maybe the school's not. And I'm sure many other factors. So my advice, and you could do
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:15.440]   this very early, is go tour the public school in the district you live in. A lot of public schools
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.760]   will let you go on those tours for new families even earlier. So you can just start to get a sense
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.080]   of it and start talking to parents about it and just kind of figure out what makes sense for you.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:29.360]   But there's no definitive answer here. I can't tell anyone what to do because it's so circumstantial.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:35.760]   And nothing is permanent either. So if you choose to go public one year and it's not working,
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:40.720]   assess private. Or you choose to go private and it feels like it may not be the best fit,
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.080]   you want to try public, you can do that. Nothing is permanent.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.560]   And that's true for both kids, right? I went to private high school, and it really went well for
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.320]   me. My sister went to private high school and like six months in, she was like, "This isn't for me."
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:57.040]   And she went to public and thrived. And so it's very dependent on each child you have
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:01.520]   and what their particular personalities are and their learning needs are. Okay.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:01.920]   Okay.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.800]   We're going to wrap this up.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:08.240]   Next question from Justin. He asks about tips for traveling with kids.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.920]   Okay. I feel like we could make a whole episode out of travel with children.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.680]   And honestly, you asked me this question, but you are really the pro here.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:20.240]   So why don't we at least try to get through some of the fundamentals here and some of the
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.080]   great things we've learned. There are people that have done this much longer and better than us,
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:28.720]   and maybe we need one of them to join us for that fuller episode. But what are your
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:32.640]   goals for travel with kids? And how do you make it better?
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:40.320]   So a few things have saved us on the trips we've taken. One, I think going into it with
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:47.040]   the understanding that everything is flexible. You know me, I'm super type A. I like having a
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:52.560]   very clear, structured schedule. And when you're traveling, that's just not reasonable,
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:57.200]   and it's not realistic. And so being able to kind of put that out of your mind and say,
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:02.640]   "Everything is flexible. Anything kind of goes day of, and it's just survival mode,"
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   it sets a low bar in the parents' mind. And I think that helps.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.440]   But really, everything is flexible. And the more you can flex and kind of go with the flow
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:16.080]   during those very small travel windows, the better off I think everyone will be.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:22.640]   The second thing I would say is pack less and buy more when you need it and you're traveling.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.840]   Or rent more.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.800]   Or rent more. BabyQuip is actually a really great site. It's global at this point. And so
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:34.320]   most of the countries you go to, you can rent whatever kind of baby gear, toys,
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:39.760]   cribs, high chairs, whatever it is that you need at the destinations. You're not having to lug
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:45.200]   all of this stuff in addition to a kid or kids with you. And so that makes the travel just
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.680]   so much easier in my mind. And then I think two other quick hits.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:56.080]   One, if you're traveling in the car for a longer period of time or on a plane ride,
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:02.080]   pack snacks. Pack a lot of snacks. Pack like 5X what you think you need. And if you can find
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:08.400]   new snacks that your kids haven't been heavily exposed to, that's a great idea. Because it's
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:14.400]   odd how kids suddenly just are hungry 24/7 when they're on an airplane or traveling. And so this
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.080]   way, you're just extra prepared and no one gets hangry through the process.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:24.960]   You also pack so many amazing new activities like a new watercolor book, a new set of things that
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.480]   you can stick on the seat behind you. Sorry to whoever sits in front of our children.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.480]   All kinds of stuff like that.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:36.160]   Yeah. And it can be really simple things like you can buy this really cheap colored tape.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:41.120]   It's almost like painters tape, but it's smaller rolls for little kids. And it's just colored tape.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.880]   And you just let them go wild. And they just tape wherever, seat backs, their clothes,
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.400]   whatever it might be. And then you just take it all off before the plane lands and
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:56.240]   killed a good 30 minutes and brought a little sanity to our lives. So that's big.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:03.120]   And then the last one I think we've learned the hard way is just plan less through the days that
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:08.960]   you're out traveling and on vacation. I think we have a tendency to go, go, go and to try to fit
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:15.840]   and pack in as much as possible. And especially with younger kids, it's a lot and it can be really
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:20.720]   overwhelming. It can feel really overstimulating depending on where else you are in the world.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:28.400]   And so I would say just plan one big thing for all of you to do in that day. And all the other
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:33.120]   little things can kind of fall into place as you're out and about. But to try to pack everything in
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:38.960]   with a full schedule is going to result in full meltdowns. Yep. We've seen those meltdowns.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.920]   Sometimes I forget that those meltdowns exist and you have to remind me when I come up with crazy,
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.560]   ambitious ideas. But a few other things. So if you don't have an au pair that's coming with you,
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:53.840]   but you are in a place that's interesting, you want to see things, you can hire local child care.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:57.920]   And we have lots of friends that have done this. They've reached out to the hotel usually and said,
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.880]   "Hey, do you have a recommendation for someone?" If it's an Airbnb, you could ask the host.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:07.040]   And just like there are babysitters in the US that you can hire to come over,
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:11.520]   there are all over the world. This is a thing everyone uses. And so that's something that
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:16.560]   will allow you to have a little bit of time on any vacation you're on and really get to see
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.880]   and explore. On this topic, someone else actually asked how we think about flying with kids,
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.920]   whether it's in business or coach. I have a few kind of tips on in-betweens. But Amy,
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.640]   I'm curious how you think about that decision. Our kids are young enough that I don't know that
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:37.680]   we've had to fully land on a decision here. But it is definitely something we think about often
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:43.520]   because on the one hand, we don't want to fly economy overseas, especially when we have a ton
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:48.880]   of points that we can really optimize around finding good business class. At the same time,
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:54.080]   we don't want to expose our kids purely to these upgrades and this life that it's just not
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:56:00.320]   reality all the time and they need to build some grit. The way we've approached it is if it is
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:08.480]   crossing the ocean, particularly overnight, we will upgrade. If it is stateside, we typically
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.240]   won't upgrade. Just to be clear, since I'm like the nerd about the points and miles here,
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.920]   we're never actually really upgrading because it's always a terrible deal to upgrade with points and
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.400]   miles. We're just booking directly in business. And I think it's funny because we've tried to
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:26.480]   adhere to this idea of crossing an ocean overnight, book in business, but we've never actually paid
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:32.640]   for it. Just to be clear, we would never pay. If the choice was spend $3,000 in business class
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   or fly economy, we'd be flying economy every single time. But if the choice is we found a
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.800]   great deal with our points and miles to be able to fly in business on an overnight flight where
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.520]   we're going to show up at 6am and we're otherwise going to be completely unrested, we would try to
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:51.680]   do that as much as possible and just really emphasize to kids, probably more like you said
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.760]   when they're older, that here's how we're doing this. When it comes to business, I think we'll
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:59.840]   have more conversations to have with our kids as they get older. And I certainly just don't want
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:04.400]   them to think that this is just a normal thing because the way we pay for it isn't normal.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.240]   We're not paying for it with dollars. And funny enough, I was talking to a friend about
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:14.320]   this airline Zip Air, which is like business class, but it's like the spirit of business
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.960]   class. There's no frills. You pay for your own meal, you get to pay for your own pillow,
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:22.080]   but you get a lie flat bed. And ultimately, I'm like, "Well, that's what I really care about.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.800]   I care about showing up rested and not missing a night and ruining a few days of a vacation that
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:32.000]   otherwise can be really expensive." Because there's a lot of costs that come to a vacation,
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.680]   which actually reminds me, you have this great idea that we haven't gotten to implement about
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.520]   how to think about planning and costs. Can you share a little about that for people who maybe
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.600]   have older kids? Yeah. So we haven't tried it because we don't have older kids yet.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.680]   But I think one thing we're excited to do is as our kids get a little older,
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:54.080]   enabling them to participate more in the planning and the decision-making process of the trip.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:59.840]   So helping them understand, here's how much we have allocated towards this trip, whether it's
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:06.160]   points, miles, dollars, whatever it may be, and helping them understand the different trade-offs
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:13.040]   of making these decisions, knowing that there is a limited resource to how much we are willing to
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:19.120]   spend to have the ideal trip we want. And so I think that becomes really interesting because
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:23.520]   it allows them to really start understanding the value of a point and how that's earned,
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:28.160]   or a dollar and how that's earned and spent. Yeah. I'm excited to give them all the award
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:32.000]   booking tools and be like, "You got to plan this trip." And I'm like, if they come back and say,
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.040]   "This thing is going to cost too many miles," be like, "No, go back to the drawing board. You
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:38.560]   didn't work hard enough. You didn't find the best deal." Or, "Oh, that restaurant is not as
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:44.960]   good. Keep looking." Or they'll come back at age seven and just have this perfect itinerary,
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:50.240]   little digital wizards. Yeah. I wonder whether they follow in those footsteps or they become
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.040]   the ultimate satisficers where we're like, "Hey, do you want to go to dinner?" And they're like,
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.600]   "Yeah, any restaurant." I'm like, "What do you mean? You don't want to pick the best restaurant?"
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:00.480]   They're like, "Whatever. We'll just do whatever." It's going to be really fun to see them grow up
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:05.440]   and travel. So obviously, we talked about there's more travel. I think we need to do some homework.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:11.120]   We haven't traveled enough combo of pandemic and young kids. Honestly, an answer to how to travel
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:16.720]   with kids in the toddler phase might just be don't do it. I'm not going to say that having kids that
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.560]   are jumping out of your lap, running around planes, not sleeping, being tired, being great,
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:29.040]   that's not fun. And I think there's a period of time from six to 24 months that is probably my
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:33.200]   least favorite time to travel with children. And we're just coming out of that with our youngest.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.240]   And so I think we'll have a lot more advice on this in the years to come.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:41.760]   This episode is brought to you by Fabric by Gerber Life. If you have anyone relying on your income,
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.840]   then you really should be considering life insurance, but be careful going with the policy
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:50.720]   you get at work because it might not offer enough protection or follow you if you leave your job.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.840]   Instead, get your peace of mind from a term life insurance policy. And Fabric by Gerber Life is

[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:59.040]   content for kids. I think I'm gonna let you take this, but I'm amazed at the wide spectrum
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:05.360]   of content for children and how wild and flashing and screaming and crazy it can be
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.480]   and how little I thought about this until you brought it up and how much it might affect
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.080]   how they're thinking or what they're doing and whatnot. So what are some of your top favorites?
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.880]   So Anna asked specifically about screen time. So I'll touch on some of the shows that our kids
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.600]   watch that are low stimulation. Some of our favorites are Bluey. Bluey is great, by the way,
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.400]   for parents and kids. So I can't imagine there's a parent that hasn't checked out Bluey. But if you
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.880]   haven't, or even if you're not a parent, I think you'd enjoy it. It is so entertaining. And the
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:38.480]   best part is the shows are all about nine to 10 minutes. So really quick hits, which is really
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:43.760]   nice. So if you say one show, it's nine to 10 minutes, and that's it. A few others we love,
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:50.240]   Trash Truck, Lucas the Spider, and Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, which is kind of a new spin on
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.280]   Mr. Rogers. Yeah, it's great. Shout out to Kevin Rose, who told us to check out Stillwater,
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.440]   which I've put in the newsletter, and I probably talked about on the show. But another really,
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:07.280]   really great show for kids, low stim, lots of like Buddhist principles into life. And honestly,
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.360]   I could just watch that show myself also. And I really love the song that plays in the credits.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.520]   But just to be clear, I think these are the shows we like. We try to really limit screen time a lot.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.240]   Go bananas on screens on an airplane. We're open the floodgates because...
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.040]   No rules.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:28.080]   No rules. We're just trying to survive. But outside of that, I would say we kind of reserve
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:35.520]   it for a special occasion or maybe on a weekend. But it's certainly not the primary form of things.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:40.480]   But I'm sure people will have various degrees of opinions on screen time. And
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.480]   granted, I agree. We did, too. I think every parent I know starts out with, "We're going to
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:49.200]   never have screens." And some of them make it there and some don't. But things like that are
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.640]   all things that we do when the few times we have screen time off an airplane. And then there's a
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.960]   handful of apps that we've used. I've talked about Mentava in the past, which is like an accelerated
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03.360]   learning app that's kind of fun. ABC Mouse has some interesting
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.720]   content for kids. Khan Academy has a cool app, but I can't remember what it's called.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.360]   But I think our kids are just starting to get old enough that using an app is fun.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.680]   Honestly, early on, even a show wasn't interesting. So that was a struggle. We were on a plane ride
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.000]   once and we were trying to get our 18-month-old, "Can't you just be interested in this show and
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.960]   stop running around the airplane, please?" And she's like, "No, don't want it." But actually,
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.440]   one tip that I thought of on this show, we were trying to let our daughter watch a show on the
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:36.480]   plane and we put on a movie of some sort. She wasn't interested. It turns out, she just only
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.400]   had about five minutes of attention for each individual show. And then if we were willing
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.200]   to change the show to another show every five minutes, we could hold her attention for longer.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.640]   And so that might be a little hack that someone could use. Yeah, that's a great one.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:54.000]   I think we hit a lot on parents and children. I like doing these with you. And so I hope we
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.160]   can do more. So allthehacks.com/AMA. If you have questions for me, for Amy, for us, we're going to
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.840]   try to do these a bit more regularly. This is a lot of fun. Any final thoughts?
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.080]   To all the parents out there, we see you. We appreciate you. You're doing great work. Keep
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.720]   going. And to all the parents coming, it might sound hard, but it is so rewarding.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.640]   Thanks so much for listening. We'll see you next week.
