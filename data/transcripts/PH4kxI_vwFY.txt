[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   Mr. Chairman and Christian friends, before I call your attention to the message from
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.960]   the Word of God that I feel constrained to deliver to you tonight, I may be allowed to
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:23.000]   say just a personal word in which I can express my sense of privilege at being present on
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.240]   this interesting and important occasion.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.360]   I counted a very great privilege to be here, and that mainly because of my admiration for
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.840]   the new minister of this church, the Reverend Gordon Murray.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.800]   I can't give the exact years, but I imagine it must be some twenty years since I first
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.080]   had the pleasure of meeting him when he belonged to a different section of the Christian church.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.160]   I was preaching on an afternoon in the town of Weston-super-Mare, and there was a tea
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.880]   between the afternoon and the evening service.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:13.120]   And I found myself sitting at the tea table next to this young man, who obviously was
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.440]   a fine evangelical Christian and an ordained minister.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.560]   And I was somewhat surprised to find his particular affiliation.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.400]   It puzzled me somewhat as to how that had been possible.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.840]   And I remember thinking about that afterwards.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.680]   And later, of course, he made it quite clear that my perplexity was also his perplexity.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.840]   And he took a move, and now he's being inducted here as pastor of a Baptist church.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.120]   He's a man, in other words, of conviction.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.160]   He's a man of understanding.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.360]   But he's also a man of principle.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.200]   There are unfortunately men today who have understanding, but they're not men of principle.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   What's the difference?
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.440]   Well, it's this.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.920]   A man who only has understanding may do nothing about it.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.360]   But a man who is a man of principle, in addition, puts his understanding into practice.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.120]   And that is what our friend has done.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.240]   He's a man of great courage, the courage of his convictions, and he's acted upon him.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.200]   And I count it, therefore, a great honor to be here tonight and taking part in this service.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.360]   Men today who stand for truth and are prepared to suffer and to sacrifice for it are men
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.400]   who are deserving of very special honor.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.080]   And such is the new minister of this church.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   We pay our tribute also to his wife, who has stood with him so loyally and steadfastly
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.840]   during a time which must have been, on certain occasions, really difficult and most trying
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   with their four children.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:20.700]   So I felt I must express my sense of privilege at being allowed to take some small part on
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.320]   this interesting occasion.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.360]   I'm glad to be in this church once more.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.560]   I've been coming back and forth here for some 25 years and more, and therefore feel I've
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.160]   got to know something about the church.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.920]   And I've honored the previous ministers and the late Secretary, Mr. Adams, a man whom
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.080]   I greatly respected.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:49.000]   And so it gives me particular joy to be here on this interesting and important occasion.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.840]   Well now, I'd like to call your attention to some of the verses that were read to us
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.760]   at the beginning in the second chapter of the first epistle of Timothy.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.720]   Let me read again verses 4, 5, 6, and 7.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.320]   Let me read verse 3 as well.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.920]   "For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who will have all men to
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.360]   be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:31.600]   For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.280]   himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.440]   Whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:54.760]   I speak the truth in Christ and lie not, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity."
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.200]   I needn't tell you that we are meeting in a day of great confusion.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.040]   It's the great characteristic of our modern world.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:11.760]   There's confusion in every realm, political, social, moral, every realm you can think of.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.760]   But this confusion is most regrettable and most tragic when you find it in the realm
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.160]   of the Christian church.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.120]   And there is particular confusion at the present time with regard to the whole question of
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.960]   what is a Christian church?
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.680]   What is the function of the church?
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.760]   What is the business and the function of a Christian minister?
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.560]   Here we are present at the induction of a new minister.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.560]   What's his work?
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   What's he for?
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.200]   What's he supposed to do?
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.600]   What is the task of the church and of the minister?
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.240]   Now I needn't tell you that there's great confusion with respect to this.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.520]   You read about it in the papers constantly.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.960]   You hear discussions on this theme on the radio and perhaps on the television and other
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960]   places.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.520]   People seem to be quite uncertain as to what it's all about.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.320]   Even this chapter that was read to us reminded us of one very urgent pressing problem about
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.080]   which there is great confusion at the present time.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.400]   Should women be ordained?
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   Should women preach?
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.520]   You see, the Bible is a very contemporary book.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.040]   Some people are foolish enough to say they're not interested in the Bible because it's such
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.600]   an old book.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.680]   I suggest that it's the most contemporary document that we have.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.800]   There is no problem confronting us but that it is dealt with somewhere here.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.400]   And this is the first point I want to make tonight, that it is not for us to decide what
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.480]   the church is or what the ministry is or what the function of the church and the ministry
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   are.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.720]   That's not our prerogative.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.160]   The whole confusion arises today because people think that they are in a position to decide
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.320]   these matters.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.200]   And they decide them, as you know, in terms of it's very nice, they say.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.640]   It would be very nice to do this or to have that.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.120]   Or we're in days when people are talking about women's lib.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.320]   Therefore, women should be ordained and so on.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:39.040]   The fallacy is, I say, that it's assumed that we today are in a position to decide what
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.560]   Christianity is, what the church is, and what the minister is and his business.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.840]   Now the answer to all that is this very chapter we're looking at, this epistle.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.520]   It's called a pastoral epistle.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.400]   And there are other pastoral epistles.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.800]   And these are our only authority.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.680]   The church didn't start in our generation.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.600]   The church has been going for nearly two thousand years.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.280]   And what we must be concerned about is that we conform to the pattern and the teaching
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.400]   that have been laid down for us.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.520]   And here we have it in this Word of God.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.880]   Here the apostle was writing to this younger man, Timothy, and he reminds him of the nature
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.760]   of the church in the next chapter.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.960]   He tells him how he should conduct himself in the church and in the life of the church.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   We have no excuse.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:46.760]   Our business is to conform to this pattern and to this teaching which we have here.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:55.400]   And so I call your attention to what the apostle tells us is the main function and purpose
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:02.880]   of the church and those in the church who are set apart for the preaching of the gospel.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.960]   Paul, you remember, he very often gives us his authority.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.520]   He says he's been ordained a preacher.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.000]   He didn't call himself to be a preacher.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.240]   He tells us this repeatedly.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.480]   There were self-appointed apostles and preachers in the early church as there are today.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.240]   And much of the confusion is due to that.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.360]   A preacher is a man who is called by God.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.480]   He doesn't decide to enter the ministry.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.120]   He's called and he's ordained and he's set apart.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:42.960]   And he's set apart as a preacher and a teacher in faith and in verity.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:50.000]   So now we're in a position to consider what is, therefore, the business of the church
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.160]   at the present time.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.080]   Here we are in a world of great trouble, a world of crisis.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   Everybody's aware of this.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.680]   What will the moral bring forth?
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.400]   Who can tell?
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.520]   We seem to be in a collapsing society, in a collapsing world.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.960]   What's the peculiar function of the Christian church at the present time?
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.360]   Why do we come here tonight?
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.760]   Is this worthwhile?
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.720]   What has the church got to say at the present time?
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.480]   Well, as you know, there is this terrible confusion with regard to this.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.960]   There are those who seem to think that the business of a preacher is to express his own
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:38.000]   opinions on political and social questions, that he's ever to be talking about a party
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.400]   in South Africa and about war and this and that, and that the church is here to tell
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:50.200]   statesmen what to do and to pass resolutions and to direct governments and so on.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:56.040]   Many hold that view of the function of the church and of the ministry at the present
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   time.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.360]   And there are many other views which people have which are very remote indeed, as we shall
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.160]   see from what we are taught here.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.840]   Coming closer to ourselves, perhaps, evangelical people, there are some who seem to think that
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.280]   the main task of the preacher is to fill the church.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.240]   Well, now, we all, of course, would be delighted if all our churches were packed out Sunday
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.240]   by Sunday.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.800]   But, you know, the primary task of a preacher is not even to fill his church.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.040]   And we must be quite clear about this.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:36.240]   I'm reminded of a story about one of my predecessors at Westminster Chapel.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.880]   He had come down from Scotland and was there in the ministry in the 1920s.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:48.240]   And unfortunately, the congregations were tending to go down and doing so very rapidly.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.520]   And the then secretary of the church was very perturbed and worried about this and was foolish
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.640]   enough to show his anxiety to the preacher.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.800]   And the preacher recognized this and turned to the secretary and said, "What's the matter?"
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   He said, "What are you worried about?"
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.080]   "Well, a little bit worried," said the secretary, "about the congregations."
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.000]   "Ah," said the preacher, "is this what you want?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.880]   Do you want to have this place full?"
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.800]   "Well, yes," said the secretary.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.360]   "Well," he said, "there's no difficulty about that.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   I can fill this chapel for you whenever you like."
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.840]   The secretary was taken aback.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.800]   He couldn't understand it.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.680]   And so this preacher, Dr. John Hutton, he said, "You know, if you want to have this
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:40.440]   place packed out, you announce that the Sunday after next I shall conduct public worship
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:46.800]   here dressed in the suit of an eaten schoolboy, and you'll have the place packed out."
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.600]   And of course, he was quite right.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.040]   It's one thing to fill a building, but the question is how do you fill it?
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.440]   With what kind of people do you fill it?
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:04.000]   The primary task of the preacher is not even merely to fill the church.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And recently, one gets the impression that there are those who are good evangelical people,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.600]   but they are telling us now increasingly that the day of preaching has gone.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:25.960]   They hold the view, they say it quite openly, that the modern man is incapable of sitting
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:32.160]   and listening to a reasoned discourse which lasts anything over a quarter of an hour.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.760]   They believe this quite sincerely.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:39.280]   I read a statement by one of them recently, quite a well-known man in evangelical circles
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   in this country.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:46.520]   He said, "The modern man has become word-resistant."
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:53.200]   And so he says that because the modern man is word-resistant, he can't listen to preaching
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.160]   and to words, we must adopt a different kind of service.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.480]   And this particular man has introduced dancing into his services.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.560]   He's introduced drama.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.320]   He's introduced miming of the scriptures.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:14.480]   He's introduced more and more singing in his own church and in his campaigns which he holds
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   elsewhere.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.680]   Now this is a very serious matter because, you see, the implication is that it's the
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:27.760]   man in the street who decides and that we are to be governed by what he is like or by
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.920]   what he thinks or by what he may say.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:41.000]   The answer to all that I assert again is this, that we are to be governed solely by the teaching
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.880]   of the scriptures themselves.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.320]   We are not here to entertain people.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.960]   The world can perform drama very much better than the church can.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:57.200]   If you want drama, well, go and get it as the world does it and does it well.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.840]   If you want singing, entertainment, don't come to church, go to the world.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:08.560]   That's its function, that's its business, and it does it in a very good and interesting
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.560]   manner.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.760]   That is not the primary task of the Christian church.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.160]   Well, what is the church for?
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.520]   What's the minister for?
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.800]   The apostle tells us.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:24.240]   We are here to bring people to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.400]   This is the calling of the minister, the teacher, the preacher.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:34.240]   The whole church is set for this purpose, to hold forth this truth.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:40.360]   Paul in the next chapter says the church is the pillar and the ground of the truth, holding
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.960]   it up before men.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.640]   And I want to assert this here tonight.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:52.940]   The greatest need in the world at this moment is the preaching of this truth.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:58.640]   The world is as it is because it doesn't know this truth, because it's ignorant of this
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.640]   truth.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:08.120]   The primary task of the church and her representatives is to bring people to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.280]   Why is this so?
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:16.200]   Why does one assert this so dogmatically, so definitely?
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.000]   The many answers I could give to this I mustn't keep you.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   This is God's command.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.560]   It isn't ours.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:32.640]   You see, the Lord Jesus Christ himself said that he had come a witness to the truth.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.840]   Now he did a lot of good deeds.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.000]   He healed the sick.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.200]   And the church should engage in this wider kind of ministry.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   But the church is not here primarily even to heal the sick or to give people comfort
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.900]   and consolation.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.900]   We do that.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.800]   It's incidental to the ministry.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.280]   It's an outcome of the ministry, but it's not the primary task of the ministry.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.640]   And yet I think you all realize and know that increasingly emphasis is being placed today
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:14.440]   on these things, the form of service, healing, various other activities, and preaching and
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.360]   the presentation of the truth are becoming less and less central.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.400]   We must, I say, return to this.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   Why?
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:30.720]   Well, because it is the command of God and the Lord himself said that he had come to
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.520]   bear witness to the truth.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.080]   He said, "I am the light of the world."
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.320]   This means knowledge, understanding.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.920]   This is what the world needs at the present time.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:50.400]   And the Holy Spirit, as you remember, is described as the spirit of truth.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:58.040]   Now I'm not here to say a word against emphasis upon experience or the experimental side.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.320]   Indeed, I stand for an emphasis of this.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.680]   God forbid that we should ever be content with a mere intellectual academic knowledge
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.880]   of truth.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.140]   The truth is experimental.
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.320]   It is living.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.280]   Christ said, "I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly."
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:24.360]   But the church is not here primarily to give people experiences either.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.760]   Experiences do follow the acceptance of the truth.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.160]   But the church is not primarily concerned to give people experiences.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.160]   Why?
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:39.160]   Well, because there are many agencies that can give people experiences.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.220]   There are people who are having experiences through taking drugs.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.920]   There are people who have experiences as the result of consulting psychologists.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.300]   There are many agencies, transcendental meditation.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.840]   There are all sorts of agencies in the world giving people a bit of happiness or peace
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.280]   or joy or relieving the strain.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.320]   Drugs can do so and so on.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.540]   Now, this is not the primary task of the church.
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:11.080]   What makes the church tonight different from every institution and agency in the world
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:18.640]   is this, that she is here to call men and women's attention to the truth.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:24.240]   This is the peculiar thing that separates the Christian church from all the cults and
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.240]   all these other agencies that are concerned to give people a little bit of happiness or
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.040]   joy or some experience for the time being.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:38.640]   The peculiar characteristic of Christianity is that everything that it gives is an outcome
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.600]   or a result of this truth.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.280]   But someone may say to me, "That's all very well, but are not these people of the BBC
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:55.080]   and others correct when they say that the modern man can't take it in, that he's so
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:01.120]   accustomed to looking at pictures or tabloid newspapers that he can't listen to a presentation
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.680]   of the truth in a reasoned manner?"
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.680]   What about that?
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.800]   Well, the answer is perfectly simple.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.120]   Men and women have always been like this.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.680]   To start with, I don't accept this diagnosis of the modern man.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.000]   It's a terrible thing, you know.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.640]   If it is true, it means that all our money spent on education is valueless.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.480]   We've multiplied our schools, colleges, universities, and yet we are told that the people can't
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.920]   listen to a discourse that lasts more than a quarter of an hour.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.440]   So much for our education.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.840]   Three hundred years ago in the days of the Puritans, they could listen to sermons lasting
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.940]   three hours, and they rejoiced in them, and they reveled in them.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.240]   But quite apart from that, you see the fallacy of the argument.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.320]   They forget the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:58.280]   Of course the natural man doesn't receive these things, but we preach in the demonstration
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.200]   of the Spirit and of power.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:07.760]   And the Spirit of God can awaken men and give them the ability to understand and to receive
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.340]   the truth.
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:15.280]   And so, as Mr. Murray said, though we are weak and ineffective in and of ourselves,
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:23.000]   we have the message and we have the power of the Holy Ghost to apply it and to open
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.840]   men's minds and understandings and awaken them and quicken them and bring them to a
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.080]   knowledge of this truth.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.680]   This is the primary task.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.000]   Well then, what is this truth?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.160]   Let me hurriedly remind you of it as it's summarized here for us by the great apostle.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:51.960]   He says that it is the will of God that all men should come, that all men be saved, and
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.000]   to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.920]   Now notice what he says.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.760]   The truth.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.000]   This is something definite.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   The truth.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.600]   It's not some vague talk.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.160]   It's not something nebulous or indefinite.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.520]   It's not something that you are seeking for.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.640]   Now this is the impression given today, isn't it?
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.040]   You know, I say very frequently these days that I'm not surprised that the masses of
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.560]   the people are outside our churches.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:32.240]   I'm not surprised for this reason, that they get their idea of Christianity from what they
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   hear on the television and the wireless.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.040]   And what do they hear?
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.800]   Well, they hear these professors at Cambridge and other places who give us the impression
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.720]   that unless you are a professor in one of these universities, you can't possibly know
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.600]   anything about truth at all.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.200]   They're seeking for it and they're very unclear about it and they're very muddled and they
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.000]   disagree among one another and they bring out their books that contradict one another
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.480]   and they're not certain of anything.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.400]   And so the man in the street says, "Well, there is no truth.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.880]   If these great men don't know what it is, how can I know what it is?"
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.640]   So he's no longer interested in it.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:17.480]   But you see, these men are guilty of denying the biblical and especially the New Testament
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.480]   teaching.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.080]   It is the truth.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.520]   Paul is never tired of telling us that what he preached was not the result of his own
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.880]   thinking and studying and meditation.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.560]   He tells us the exact opposite.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.080]   "I received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.180]   A dispensation of the gospel has been committed unto me."
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.240]   He never arrived at it as a result of a process of thought.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.760]   As you remember, he had to be knocked down literally on the road to Damascus by a sight
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.240]   of the risen Lord before he got to know what the truth was.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   It is the truth.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   There's no uncertainty about it.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:06.200]   And all this idea that you can't be certain about the truth and that you must be a great
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.520]   philosopher or a great student and hope to arrive at it, it's a negation of the whole
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.520]   of the Bible.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:19.400]   There is a truth once and forever delivered and committed unto the saints.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.600]   And that is the only truth.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.280]   Now, I know when I say something like that, people may be shocked and say, "But isn't
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.720]   this arrogance on your part?
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.520]   Are you saying that you alone are right?"
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.360]   No, I'm not saying that I'm right.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.760]   I'm saying that the truth is clear and that my simplicity believes the truth as it's
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.240]   been revealed.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.160]   And we must say this.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.120]   If we have not got a unique message tonight for the world, the sooner the better we close
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.880]   down all our churches.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.960]   No, no, we have a unique message.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.280]   It's been delivered to us.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.440]   It's been committed to us.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.320]   It is the truth that we have in this book.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   And here it is.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   Let's look at it.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.280]   The truth.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.280]   What is this truth?
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.560]   Where does it start?
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:15.760]   Well, you know, unlike much modern preaching, it doesn't start with man.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.840]   It starts with God.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.280]   There is one God.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.440]   Most of the troubles in the world tonight are due to the fact that people don't believe
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.720]   in God.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.280]   That's why you've got industrial strife and confusion.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:37.280]   That's why you've got lawlessness in your trade unions and in the whole of society,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.440]   in the homes, in the schools, and everywhere else.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.320]   People don't believe in law.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.320]   Why?
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.560]   Because they don't believe in the ultimate law-giver.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:55.440]   It is a lack of belief in God that accounts for the moral tragedy of our modern world,
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.880]   the terrible confusion and the collapse of all our institutions.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.040]   So we must start with God.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.920]   We are living in a troubled world, yes, but you don't start with us and our troubles.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.000]   You start by asking what is the world?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.680]   Where does it come from?
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.160]   Is it man's world?
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:23.600]   Is it clever modern men with this technology that has invented and created the world?
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.260]   What is the world?
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.260]   What is man?
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:31.640]   Before you begin to talk about problems and the solution of the problems, start with the
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.600]   world, start with man.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.600]   What is it?
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.720]   Where does it come from?
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.520]   This is the basic question.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.080]   It's come from God.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.560]   There's no other explanation of the universe.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.760]   I was reading only this last week.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.520]   You know, these modern scientists, it's interesting and almost amusing.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.080]   They were so confident until comparatively recently that there were people living on
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.960]   Mars, or if there were not even people, there was a generate life on Mars.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.680]   They are now having to confess that there is no life on Mars.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:15.120]   Indeed, in this learned journal, the latest number of this learned journal, they're even
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.320]   now admitting that there's no such thing even as organic matter on Mars.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.320]   It's all inorganic.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.560]   You see, they don't understand the universe.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:30.720]   It's the Bible alone that explains the universe and the whole world.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.960]   In the beginning, God created.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.080]   That's where it all comes from.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:44.120]   And the same, you see, is true of everything in the whole of creation.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.360]   And if you want to see a better world, or if you want to know happiness and peace and
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.680]   joy, don't start with the world or with yourself.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.680]   Start with God.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.840]   And there's only one God.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.680]   As Blaise Pascal said, he's not the God of the philosophers.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.400]   He's the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.720]   The God who has revealed and manifested himself not only in nature and creation and history
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:19.520]   and providence, but supremely in this word which he has spoken to men.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:26.280]   And our primary task is to tell the godless men and women of this country and of the world
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:35.200]   who are living in such confusion and chaos that God is and is over all.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.880]   This is where we start.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:46.360]   And then you notice the apostle goes on to say there is one God and one mediator between
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:54.000]   God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:03.480]   So having started by reminding people of God, the God with, the great Jehovah, the great
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:14.640]   I Am, the everlasting God from eternity to eternity, you then ask your question, "Well,
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.640]   what is man?
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:20.680]   What is man in the modern world with all his troubles and problems?
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.040]   Why is he having to take drugs?
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.920]   Why is he having to drink to be happy?
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.040]   Why can't he stare at home and think?
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.280]   Why must he be always running out to the bingo hall or to pictures or somewhere else or turning
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.840]   on his television or his wireless?
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.520]   What's the matter with man?"
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:43.960]   Well, the Bible tells us he needs to be saved.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:50.800]   That is, it says, "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior, who will
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.320]   have all men to be saved."
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.360]   Man needs to be saved.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.120]   He needs a mediator.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   What's this?
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.000]   Well, you see, the world is completely ignorant of this.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.440]   And that's why to me it is such a travesty of Christianity and almost an unforgivable
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.160]   sin for men to go into pulpits on Sundays or on weekdays and to be talking about apartheid
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:22.440]   in South Africa, when what they need to tell people is that they, these people who are
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.280]   listening to them, need to be saved.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.960]   And they need to be rescued.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.960]   Why?
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.800]   Well, because, you see, we're all face to face with God.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.720]   This is the great message of the Bible.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.280]   Man is not an evolved animal.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.280]   He's a creature made in the image and likeness of God.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.280]   And he was made perfect, and he lived in a place called paradise.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.160]   Well, why is he in trouble?
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.840]   Why is the world as it is tonight?
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.200]   The answer is because men in his folly rebelled against God.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.320]   He sinned against God.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.480]   And God drove him out of paradise.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.680]   And there he is struggling ever since.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:08.320]   And the whole long story of the human race is one of trouble and tragedy, strife and
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.160]   war, confusion and muddle.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   Why?
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.160]   Because man's lost.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.480]   He's lost his soul.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:22.960]   This thing that God has put within us all, this thing that made us capable of communion
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.560]   with God, and this is the supreme glory of man, that he, distinct from all animals, is
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.840]   capable of communion with God.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.120]   But he's become estranged from God.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.080]   And he's become miserable and self-centered.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.440]   And even when he thinks of God, he can't get back to him.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.760]   Because God is just and righteous and holy.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:50.000]   And man is not only finite, but he's sinful.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   But he is lost.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   What's it mean?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   It means this, you see.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.840]   And this is the whole message of the Bible, we're beginning to end.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.800]   Man is under the wrath of God.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.440]   God's displeasure is upon the world.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.240]   That's why it is as it is.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.960]   This is my teaching.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.800]   This apostle Paul taught that to the Romans.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:18.000]   He says there are epochs and eras in the history of the world when God has given all the mankind
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.640]   to a reprobate mind.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.520]   He's allowed them to carry on on their own.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.040]   He's handed things over to them.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.800]   And they've made a shambles of it all.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   No, no.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.480]   Man is estranged from God.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:40.320]   And he needs to be reconciled to God in his pride.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.800]   If he believes in God at all, he thinks he can arrive at God by a process of reasoning
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   and a philosophy.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   But he can't.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.360]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.480]   The greatest Greek philosophers failed to arrive at a knowledge of God.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.680]   It can't be done.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.920]   God is holy and I'm sinful.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.920]   God is infinite and I'm finite.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.040]   How can I ever come to a knowledge of God?
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:11.360]   As Job expressed it in his agony, "Oh, that there were a day's men.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:17.120]   Oh, that there was someone who could come between us and hold God by one hand and hold
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:23.160]   me by a day's men to bring us together, a mediator."
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:32.840]   Man you see is as he is because he's a sinner, because he's an enemy and an alien outside
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.240]   the life of God.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.600]   He is lost and he can't redeem himself.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.720]   He can do many things.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.760]   He can give us education, national health service.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.120]   He can do many things to ease our lot, but he cannot give us peace.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.120]   He cannot give us satisfaction.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:59.840]   As Augustine said of old, "Our hearts are restless until thou hast made us for thyself
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:06.360]   and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in thee."
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.880]   So this is what we are to tell people, that all our troubles are due to the fact that
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.880]   we are sinners.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:17.400]   And a sinner is a man who has not only lost contact with God, he's become self-centered
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.240]   and that makes him selfish.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:24.580]   And every man is out for himself and they fight within their classes and their unions
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:32.120]   and everybody's against everybody else, everybody out for himself, wanting everything himself.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.740]   Hence our troubles.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.840]   So man needs to be delivered out of it all.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.400]   Everything's got to be done about his sin and his sinfulness.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.600]   He needs to be reconciled to God.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.960]   He needs a new life and a new nature, a new outlook.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.320]   He needs a revolution within himself.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.640]   But he can't do this.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.360]   But we've got to tell people this.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.360]   They don't know this.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.280]   You don't read things like this in the newspaper.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.640]   You don't hear things like this on the television and on the wireless.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.360]   It's our business to tell them this.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.320]   This is the task committed to the preacher, to the church.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.480]   But thank God we don't stop at that.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.160]   We go on to the next step.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:29.520]   There is one mediator, one God and one mediator between God and men.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.000]   Now this authorized translation version is not as clear as it should be here.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.320]   Because one means, you know, one and only one.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.360]   We preach an exclusive gospel.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.880]   We have no right on the basis of this teaching to believe in a world congress of faiths.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.320]   We've got no right to believe that the Virgin Mary is a co-redemptrix with Christ.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.700]   We've no right on the ground of scriptures to believe that the saints can help us in
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:01.240]   our salvation or that the church is essential to our salvation in that sense.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.440]   It's not here.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.880]   There is only one mediator.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.880]   No other.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.240]   You know, people don't like this today.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.920]   Did you hear recently about a service held in Wolverhampton?
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.040]   And one man protested, all honor to him.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:23.240]   He couldn't go to that service which was held in a so-called Christian church.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:29.920]   But there were representatives of Mohammedanism and Buddhism and various other creeds.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.840]   And people said, "This is very nice, very nice.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.840]   We are all one."
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:38.200]   You see, they thought they were competent to decide what is right and what is wrong
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   in this respect.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.680]   Now, they were muddled, of course.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.440]   What they were interested in was interracial services.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.900]   And I hope we all believe in interracial services.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.720]   We believe a gospel which says that there is no longer Jew nor Gentile, barbarian nor
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.360]   Scythian, bond nor free, male nor female.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.360]   We are all one.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.360]   Interracial.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.360]   Yes, but not interfaith.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.920]   And what they were doing in Wolverhampton was interfaith.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.600]   They were saying there was little difference between the different creeds, the different
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   faiths.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.840]   That Christianity was only one of a number.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.800]   Others were Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Hinduism, and so on and so forth.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.760]   It's a denial.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:29.440]   There is only one mediator and none other.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:34.680]   And we must be absolutely clear about this.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   Who is he?
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:41.600]   Well, we are told he is the man, Christ Jesus.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:48.640]   It's our doctrine, the biblical doctrine, of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:56.960]   Let the clever professors spout out their imaginations, but Jesus of Nazareth is the
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.400]   eternal Son of God.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:07.000]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.760]   And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.720]   He is truly man.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.560]   He is truly God.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:23.120]   And if this isn't true, there is literally no hope for this world tonight.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:29.520]   If Jesus of Nazareth was only a man, an outstandingly clever man, a great religious genius, a political
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.280]   agitator, and all the rest that they say he was, well then, I tell you, there is literally
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.160]   no hope for anybody tonight.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.480]   There is only one hope for this world tonight, and it is this.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:52.000]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his own Son from heaven, made of
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.160]   a woman made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, the incarnation.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.920]   If it isn't true, then the world is finally lost and damned, and every one of us with
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.920]   it.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.760]   But it isn't.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:13.560]   We preach a doctrine of the incarnation and the virgin birth, the Lord Christ Jesus of
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.480]   Nazareth, the worker of miracles.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.240]   This is the one, and we must be clear about his person.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:26.400]   But not only that, there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:33.440]   Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.800]   All this is equally essential.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.080]   It isn't only Jesus Christ, Son of God.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.040]   It is Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:55.440]   It is by dying for us that he redeems us, pays the ransom for us, reconciles us to
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.280]   God, saves us.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:06.520]   He has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we may be the righteousness of
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.120]   God in him.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.800]   He has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:20.040]   My dear friends, without the shed blood of the Son of God on Calvary's hill, no one
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.040]   can be saved.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.000]   There is no salvation.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:31.520]   Without remission of sins, without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.560]   But this is our gospel committed to us.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.560]   We don't decide.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.680]   This is what formed the early church.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:44.560]   This is what has always been preached, that Jesus Christ, Son of God, is the Lamb of God
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.120]   that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:55.840]   And we must tell men and women this, that there is only one Savior and only one way
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.120]   of salvation.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:04.960]   And it is this way which he accomplished by his death upon the cross and his glorious
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.920]   resurrection on the morning of the third day, his ascension into heaven, his sitting at
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:16.880]   the right hand of God at this very moment making intercession for us, the one who can
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:23.640]   save us to the uttermost because he is who he is and what he is.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.760]   Well now then, there is our message.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.320]   That's the business of the church.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.280]   And this is the central business of the church.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.760]   But it's scarcely ever presented today.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.680]   They're talking about politics and social matters, sending their pompous resolutions
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.640]   up to prime ministers and presidents.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   This is a travesty.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.680]   We are here to preach this message.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.320]   And finally, let me ask a question.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:42:00.080]   Why is it so urgently important that we should do so and that men and women should come to
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.360]   this knowledge of the truth?
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:09.520]   So many people say today, "I'm in a world of problems and of difficulties.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:15.000]   I want something to help me to meet life and its problems."
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.360]   And when they hear something like what I've been saying tonight, they say, "But isn't
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.360]   that all remote?
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.360]   Isn't that far away?
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.400]   Isn't it removed from me?"
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:29.000]   My dear friend, it's more relevant to you than anything else whatsoever.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.400]   You go to the cults and get a nice feeling within you.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.400]   You go to some of these new services in some of our churches, and you'll sing a lot and
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.400]   you'll dance, perhaps, and you'll feel very happy.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:44.000]   But the question that arises is this.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.600]   How is all that going to help you when you're face to face with the great problems of life?
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.520]   What will that have to give you when you're lying on your deathbed?
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:00.000]   What will that say to you when someone dearer to you than life itself is taken from you?
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.680]   It's all right to have experiences, but my dear friend, you can't live on experiences.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.680]   They come and go.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.920]   We all know that.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.560]   You don't know what you'll be like when you wake up tomorrow morning.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.120]   No, no, man needs something beyond experience.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:20.320]   He needs something that is solid, a rock on which he can stand, when feelings come and
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.800]   go.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   And it is this truth.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:31.480]   You see, man is made, as I said, in the image and likeness of God.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.520]   And perhaps the greatest gift God has given to us next to the soul is the mind and the
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.520]   understanding.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:42.760]   And what man needs today is understanding.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   He doesn't need dancing.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   He doesn't need entertainment.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.240]   He doesn't need all this singing.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:52.320]   He needs to be made to think, to face facts and to face this truth.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.320]   Why?
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:44:00.400]   Well, for this reason, that whatever he may think or whatever he may feel, he has got
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.800]   to die.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:11.360]   It's appointed unto all men once to die, and after death, the judgment.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.360]   It is God's world.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:17.160]   And though men don't believe in Him, God is still there.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.880]   And when they die, they meet the judgment of God.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.800]   You see, that's why Christ came to the world.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:30.480]   God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.680]   Him should not perish.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.880]   And this is what people don't realize today.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.600]   They've got more money than they've ever had.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.400]   They can have more drink, more sex, more drugs.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.360]   They've got their entertainments and their gadgets.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.200]   But the question is, how are they going to face death?
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.920]   How are they going to face eternity?
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.560]   How are they going to face God?
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.160]   This is the question.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:59.040]   And the only thing that matters at that point is a knowledge of the truth.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:06.600]   This truth, which we are commanded and ordained to preach, is the only message that can tell
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:11.120]   a man how he can face death without a quiver or a fear.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:16.720]   He can say with Augustus' top lady, "The terrors of law and of God with me can have
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.840]   nothing to do.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:25.480]   My Savior's obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from view."
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:32.880]   Oh, my dear friends, fellow ministers particularly, let this be the thing that drives us and urges
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.880]   us on.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:38.840]   The thought of men and women dying like animals.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:45.280]   Men die in darkness at thy side without a hope to cheer the tomb, says Horatius Bonner.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.880]   Let's have a heart of compassion for them.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.120]   And you members of the churches, tell them likewise.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.200]   You are to tell them these people are dying in ignorance.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   They don't know.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:01.040]   Give them the knowledge of the truth that will tell them that if they die in their sins
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:07.880]   as they are, they'll go on to an eternity of what they are now, and even worse, an eternity
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.960]   of misery and loss and shame.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.720]   That's why we must tell them about the truth.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.240]   But let me put it positively.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.360]   Let us bring them to this knowledge of the truth.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:28.200]   Because of what this truth brings to us and what it makes of us, it saves the whole man.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.720]   The mind is renewed.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.080]   Everything is renewed.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:39.360]   If any man being Christ is a new creature, a new creation, all things are passed away.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.720]   Behold, all things are become new.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.400]   You'll have a new conception of man and of the world.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.080]   You'll have a new idea of life, something big and noble.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:56.880]   Isn't it tragic to think of the way people are spending their hours in trivialities and
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:02.600]   even knocking out the higher centers of their brains with drugs and with drink to get a
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.400]   bit of happiness, as they call it?
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.400]   It's an insult.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:13.520]   Here is a truth and a message that can enlighten your mind and understanding and give you something
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.240]   to read and to think about and to work out.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:22.280]   As long as you're in this world and to all eternity, it saves your mind, your soul, your
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.640]   spirit, and it'll eventually save your whole body.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:33.000]   And it'll give you at once a sense of peace with God and a joy in the knowledge of sins
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.840]   forgiven and a blessed hope.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.880]   There are those who are saying that doomsday is at hand.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:45.920]   Not Christians, scientists are saying that doomsday may well be at hand.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.840]   That doesn't frighten the Christian.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.640]   He always knows that it's coming.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:58.240]   This world and its kingdoms are all passing away, and they will pass away.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.560]   It doesn't make any difference to us.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:07.520]   "Blessed," says Peter, "be the God and Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who hath
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:14.160]   begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.440]   To what?
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.440]   To an inheritance incorruptible.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:25.080]   Let there be a flood such as you get here periodically, and let everything be destroyed.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.640]   It's going to be worse than that.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:37.400]   A Christian has got an inheritance which is incorruptible and undefiled and fadeth not
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.400]   away.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:45.400]   It's reserved in heaven by God for all who believe in him.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:52.160]   Well, my friends, very hurriedly and inadequately, I've simply called your attention to this
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:57.280]   mighty statement here by the Apostle Paul, the great apostle.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.240]   This is the business of the church.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.160]   The church tonight is the only hope for men.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.520]   There's none other.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:11.000]   And it's the highest privilege that a man can ever have to be called to be a preacher
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:21.920]   and a teacher and a proclaimer of this truth, this everlasting gospel, this word of God
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.520]   to a world lost in sin.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:32.200]   May he, in his great power through the Spirit, enable our beloved friend the Reverend Gordon
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:39.480]   Murray to preach and to teach, to present and to enunciate this blessed truth here Sunday
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:45.920]   by Sunday, and encourage all the members of the church and all others who ever hear him
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.800]   to do the same in this needy generation.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:59.520]   God bless you, pastor and people, and use you to be lights, luminaries, holding forth
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:07.160]   the word of life in the midst of this crooked and perverse generation.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.160]   Amen.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:13.720]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
