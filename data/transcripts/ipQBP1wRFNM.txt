[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   Instead of saying some big things I'm grateful for this Thanksgiving, like family, friends,
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.800]   and life itself, let me give a list of seemingly insignificant things that popped into my head
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.840]   - I wrote them down - that make me smile or just make me think.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.920]   I think life is amazing because of such a collection of little things, so I thought
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.480]   it'd be fun to list a few.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.520]   I'm thankful for the horse, Boxer, in the book Animal Farm by George Orwell, who had
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.360]   the motto "I will work harder" until his very last days.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.760]   To me there's always been a kind of quiet heroism to the simplicity of that motto in
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.720]   the face of a fundamentally cruel world.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:59.560]   I'm also thankful for love songs that are subtle, that look at the mundane, like Wonderful
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.720]   Tonight by Eric Clapton.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.320]   I think a lot of great love songs are kind of over-the-top dramatic, and Wonderful Tonight
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.320]   is not.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.360]   It's just admiring a moment of someone you love being beautiful once again in ways that
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.680]   have been many times before, and beautiful in a way that, to me, so this is from my perspective,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.840]   only a woman can be.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.600]   Sort of admiring a beautiful dress and how glowing a person looks on a particular night.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.440]   I'm also thankful for neural networks and deep learning for reigniting the big dream
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.880]   of artificial intelligence for me and I think for much of the world.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.240]   Neural networks as they are, are probably not enough to achieve super intelligence,
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.640]   but I think the magic that's already there in neural networks, I think will be there
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.720]   in future AGI systems, whatever they end up looking like.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.280]   Let's see.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.000]   I'm also thankful for Granny Smith apples for being a source of happiness for me throughout
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.080]   my life, especially on some of the hard weight cuts I had to do for wrestling, for judo,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.920]   for Jiu-Jitsu tournaments.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.160]   And now that I'm on a keto diet, it's a source of rare cheat meals where I just sneak
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.800]   in carbs.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.920]   When you're on keto, carbs taste even better, and apples is one of my favorite sources of
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   carbs.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.960]   I also probably have a bit of a love-hate relationship with apples because I don't know
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.040]   how to moderate them.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.280]   I don't know how to eat just one apple.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.800]   Okay, I'm also thankful for regular expressions, for being both powerful and painful, giving
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:58.320]   my sometimes OCD brain a chance to unlock the secret code behind language, if only for
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.920]   a brief moment of some seemingly insignificant task of parsing a file, a data file of some
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.200]   sort.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.640]   I'm also thankful, as I probably said way too many times, for Mr. Fyodor Dostoevsky,
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.080]   and especially for Prince Mishkin, or the main character from The Idiot, which is a
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.520]   book by Dostoevsky.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.280]   I think in particular what I've learned from Prince Mishkin is that loving the world simply
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.760]   is worth whatever trouble such an approach may, let's say, throw your way.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.000]   Okay, this list is all over the place.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.040]   I'm also thankful for, in general, the research process that's been part of my life for many
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.720]   years, many painful but glorious years.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.560]   So the idea of going from the initial idea with colleagues to doing the different kinds
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:00.440]   of experiments, to then writing it up with the elegant typography of LaTeX, submitting
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.880]   it to a conference or a journal, but conference is my favorite, especially in computer science,
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.560]   going through the revisions, and then finally attending the conference and presenting your
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.040]   work and having all the discussions over the work, and then spurring on future ideas that
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.560]   you work on.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.520]   I think the entirety of that process is magical, and I've grown a lot from it.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.000]   I'm truly thankful for having the opportunity to do it, and I still, it's one of the reasons
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.400]   I'm maintaining an affiliation and a position at MIT.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.680]   I have regular conversations with friends and colleagues there, working on two papers
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.880]   currently still, even with all the things that are going on.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.640]   I have so much love for this process and for MIT in general that I can't let it go.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.960]   It's a big part of me, and MIT is truly a special place.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:06.240]   So it's a source of joy, and I don't want to let go easily of things that bring me joy,
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.640]   even though so many things in this world do.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.380]   Okay, I'm thankful for Mr. Dan Carlin's Hardcore History, and to be specific, the most memorable
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.240]   for me, there's a lot of great episodes, but the one that really got me was Painfultainment,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.080]   which is a single standalone episode.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.640]   It's so dark, it's so truly dark that more than the other episodes, I think it truly
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.160]   changed my view of human nature.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.680]   And as is true with dark episodes of that kind, or dark stories or philosophical ideas,
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.640]   it somehow empowered me, gave me more power to forgive my fellow human beings and forgive
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.160]   myself for the flaws that I have.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.280]   This is a weird one.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.080]   This list is just terrible.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.280]   I'm thankful for mathematics and theoretical computer science in general.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.160]   Speaking of things that bring me a lot of joy, it's just a constant source of unexpected
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.200]   beauty, both in algorithms or theorems.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.760]   It's just, I don't know why, maybe it's the way my brain is.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.160]   Maybe it's just human nature, is something about the elegant beauty that can be only
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.520]   revealed through numbers is a source of happiness, and I'm thankful for having the brain and
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.360]   the opportunity to experience the beauty that's inherent to me in mathematics.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:48.080]   Finally, I'm thankful for vodka, whiskey, and the worst of it, which is tequila, for
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.480]   being a catalyst for some wild adventures.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:59.640]   Some that I regretted at the time, but now truly can look back at with a big stupid smile
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.560]   on my face.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.720]   I think that's 10.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:10.800]   I gotta say, I appreciate all the love I've gotten over the past couple years, and I send
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.520]   it right back at you, many more fold.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.520]   Happy Thanksgiving.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.400]   I hope you have a good one.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.900]   Bye.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:26.900]   [silence]
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:36.900]   [silence]
