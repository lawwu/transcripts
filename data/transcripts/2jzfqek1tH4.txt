[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   - This is Simply Cheating.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.380]   Ben, a podcast listener writes in
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.080]   with a bundle of three questions,
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.440]   three for the price of one.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.200]   Dear Pastor John, I recently came across a website
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.800]   titled We Are Church, which is Francis Chan's new calling
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.040]   in which we read the following question.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.480]   If someone asked you to describe church
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.760]   using only the Bible, what would you say?
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.040]   Then it's explained that their church structure
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.780]   includes no salary for pastors,
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.160]   tithes and offerings are collected,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.880]   but all the money is set aside for missions
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.600]   and people meet in homes.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.200]   I have great respect for Chan, and I know you do too,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.000]   but it forces me to ask three questions.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.760]   One, is it biblical for a pastor
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.280]   to draw a salary from the church?
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.320]   Two, is it biblical for the church
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.800]   to gather together in church buildings?
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.920]   And three, is it biblical to use a weekly rhythm
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.000]   for sermons and preaching?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.920]   - Well, let's just leave aside any specific person
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920]   or website, I like Francis Chan a lot.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.340]   I count him as a good friend.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.120]   We've overlapped in lots of places, and I like him,
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.320]   and I don't wanna pick on him at all.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.600]   So I'm just gonna pose the very specific question.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.880]   Salary for pastors, question number one.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.760]   Two, preach sermons as part of regular church service.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.040]   Three, do it weekly.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.860]   Are those biblical concepts?
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.040]   Number one, is it biblical for a pastor to draw a salary?
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.940]   Well, consider these three or four texts.
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.880]   1 Timothy 5, 17, "Let the elders who rule well
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.640]   "be considered worthy of double honor,
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.360]   "especially those who labor in preaching and teaching."
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.960]   And I think that probably means those
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.280]   who are giving themselves to it a lot more than the others,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.040]   maybe full-time.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.720]   And then he says, "For the scripture says,"
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.700]   so this is the reason why you give double honor
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.200]   to those who labor in preaching and teaching.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.900]   "For the scripture says, 'You must not muzzle an ox
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.160]   "'when it is treading out the grain,
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.960]   "'and the laborer deserves his wages.'"
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.960]   So part of the double honor seems to be payment,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.640]   what the ox eats, payment for the fact
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.760]   that they are giving themselves to preaching and teaching
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.980]   rather than other gainful employment.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.200]   Here's another one.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.380]   This is from 1 Corinthians 9, 6-9.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.480]   "Is it only Barnabas," Paul says,
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.500]   "Is it only Barnabas and I who have no right
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.900]   "to refrain from working for a living?"
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.060]   In other words, he's making the case
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.840]   that he and other ministers of the word have a right,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.940]   given by the words of Jesus, we'll see,
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.200]   and the Old Testament, to refrain
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.640]   from other gainful employment in order to give himself
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.640]   to the ministry of the word.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.460]   That's what he's arguing for.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.240]   That right has been given to the preachers,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.160]   to the ministers of the word.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.140]   And then he goes on.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.600]   "Who serves as a soldier at his own expense?
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.660]   "Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit?
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.500]   "Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.400]   "Do I say these things on human authority?
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.320]   "Does not the law say the same?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.140]   "For it is written in the law of Moses,
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.180]   "You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.220]   "Is it for oxen that God is concerned?"
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.900]   So that's 1 Corinthians 9.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.660]   And then Paul gets specific
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.800]   about where the money comes from.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.760]   He says in Galatians 6, 6,
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.160]   "Let the one who is taught the word
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.040]   "share all good things with the one who teaches."
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.920]   So he's kind of working out the details
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.620]   of how the teacher who's giving himself
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.040]   not to gainful employment in the community,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.460]   but rather to teaching and preaching the word of God
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.920]   would come by his food, his wherewithal.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.800]   And then one more, Luke 10, 7.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.060]   "Jesus sent his disciples out with these words,
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.400]   "Remain in the house eating and drinking what they provide
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.120]   "for the laborer deserves his wages."
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.280]   And that's what Paul quoted earlier in 1 Timothy 5.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.880]   So I think the outworking of that statement,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.960]   the laborer deserves his wages in the mouth of Jesus
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.240]   was to be carried into the early church as a warrant
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   for why full-time people who labor in preaching
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.160]   and teaching should receive their resources from the church.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.160]   So my answer is that yes, it is a biblical principle
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.520]   that paying a pastor is a good thing.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.160]   Number two, "Is gathering together
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.160]   "for a weekly preaching of a sermon a biblical concept?"
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.640]   Well, I think the question is not weekly mainly,
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   but is preaching part of the service a biblical idea?
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.100]   Now, every generation has its voices
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.520]   that cry down preaching and announce its demise
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.060]   and its unbiblical nature.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.080]   I've been alive long enough to see two or three
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.280]   of these waves go through the church.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.280]   For 2000 years, these voices have failed
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.560]   to undo the preciousness and power of preaching
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.320]   among the gathered people of God.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.240]   Now, why is that?
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.160]   Why have all these recurrent naysayers
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.840]   never been able to remove preaching
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.900]   from the church as a whole?
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.400]   And I'll mention two reasons.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.680]   One is that the New Testament distinguishes preaching
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.380]   from other forms of communication
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.560]   like teaching and discussion,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.360]   and commands that preaching happen
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.360]   in the context of the church, not just the city square.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.760]   2 Timothy 3, 16 and 17 is a very familiar text
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.100]   where Paul describes the inspiration of the scriptures
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.920]   and its value for teaching and godliness.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.400]   And then, get rid of the chapter break,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.080]   there's no break in the thinking,
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.400]   then Timothy is commanded with one of the most amazing
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.240]   and weighty introductions to preach the word like this.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.080]   "I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.820]   "who is to judge the living and the dead,
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.840]   "and by his appearing in his kingdom, preach the word.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.640]   "Be ready in season, out of season,
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.760]   "reprove, rebuke, exhort in complete patience and teaching."
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.400]   Now, the word preach, preach the word,
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   keruxanton logon is not the same word as teaching,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.800]   didache or didasco.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.640]   It is the word for herald, a town crier,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.860]   a herald of the word, announcer of the word.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.740]   And the context is not in 2 Timothy,
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.700]   it's not evangelism on the street corner,
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.040]   but the church in need of doctrinal clarity
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.140]   and protection and teaching.
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.140]   That's where Timothy is told to preach the word.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.060]   The other reason I think preaching lasts
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.020]   from generation to generation is that
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.680]   there is something about the nature of biblical truth.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.880]   Indeed, I would say the nature of God and biblical truth
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.740]   and the gospel in particular,
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.240]   which presses the human soul to want preaching
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.100]   and to do preaching.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.600]   There are glories in the gospel that are so wonderful,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.680]   they create their own mode of communication.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.600]   It's called preaching.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.000]   They insist, these realities insist,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.100]   they force themselves out into preaching.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.700]   They resist being limited to mere teaching
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.540]   or discussion or sharing.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.400]   They beg to be heralded.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   It's the nature of God and the nature of his truth
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.520]   that creates preaching in every generation.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.080]   And as far as the last question goes about weekly,
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.960]   I don't know if that was being specifically asked or not,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.760]   but I would say I think God would be fine
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.920]   with us worshiping every day and preaching every day,
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.120]   but that would probably not be a practicable
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   or for a lifetime.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.000]   Rather, there are glimpses in the New Testament,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.720]   three of them at least,
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.040]   where the early church seemed to move the day
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.020]   of weekly worship from the last day of the week,
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.320]   the Sabbath, to the first day of the week,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.860]   different from the Old Testament.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.720]   And I think that's a pattern in order
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.080]   to honor the Lord's resurrection
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.160]   and then call it the Lord's day.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.720]   For example, Acts 20, verse seven,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.680]   "On the first day of the week,"
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.040]   the first day of the week,
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.000]   "we were gathered together to break bread."
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.120]   Or 1 Corinthians 16, two,
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.200]   "On the first day of the week,"
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.040]   each of you put aside something.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.160]   And then in Revelation 110,
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.680]   "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day."
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.540]   So yes, pastor, salaries are biblical.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.460]   Yes, preaching regularly in gathered worship is biblical.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.260]   And yes, weekly, if possible,
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.980]   on the Lord's day would also be the way
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.820]   the apostles began to do it.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.180]   - Excellent, thank you, Pastor John,
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.260]   for those three responses.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.900]   And tomorrow we're gonna talk about the exodus
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.180]   of the nation Israel out of Egypt.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.360]   This moment of deliverance really marks
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.500]   the centerpiece of redemptive history in the Old Testament.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.920]   So just how key is it?
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.540]   We're gonna explore this fascinating biblical theme tomorrow.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.040]   Until then, you can scan or search
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.240]   through all the episodes we've released over the years.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.680]   And of course, you can scan those episodes really easily
