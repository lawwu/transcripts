[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.340]   My name is Josh Ruschitz, I'm your host,
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.980]   and today we're going to continue our series
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.780]   on how to invest in your children at a very early age.
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.580]   And we're going to pivot around third base,
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.080]   fourth base, or second base.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.120]   I'm not sure which base it is
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.960]   because I've only got three bases here.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.000]   But we're going to pivot away from talking about the body
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.260]   and the mind, and now we're going to talk about the spirit.
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.140]   The spirit of our children.
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.460]   And I'm going to use this term spirit very loosely,
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.780]   sometimes talking about the spirit, the soul.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.420]   Basically, I'm trying to turn away now from the physical.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.400]   And there's nothing precise or scientific
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.980]   about my categorization scheme.
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.060]   It just is a way of organizing my thinking
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.320]   and my presentation that made sense to me
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.100]   to talk about the physical body of our children,
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.160]   talk about the mind of our children
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.340]   and developing the intellectual capacity.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.580]   But now I want to go beyond the mind.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.260]   And I want to talk about some of those areas
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.900]   of child development that will make a huge difference
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.900]   in the life outcomes of our children.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.020]   And they're things that go far beyond
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.100]   anything that we've talked about thus far.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.640]   If you think about the stories that you have heard
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.660]   of successful people, what you'll find is
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.300]   while there are many cases of successful people
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.300]   who have achieved great success by being granted
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.940]   and given all of the privileges and benefits
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.700]   that we've talked about thus far,
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.860]   there are people who are born with beautiful, healthy bodies.
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.020]   There are people who are born with incredibly powerful,
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.340]   strong, productive, intelligent minds.
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.900]   There are people who have the greatest educational system
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.820]   that surrounds them, et cetera.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.180]   But there's a whole nother class of success stories
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.420]   that we can observe.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.620]   And this class of success stories involves children
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.160]   and young people and old people too,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.340]   all of whom have had no privileges in life.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.740]   They were born handicapped.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.620]   They were not particularly attractive to look at.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.860]   Their brains were not particularly powerful
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.500]   or they had some significant personal obstacles,
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.020]   some personal handicaps, some speech impediments,
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.460]   some issue that they faced.
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.380]   And yet they were able to defy the odds
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.260]   and raise themselves from failure to success.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.540]   And if you start thinking about and studying those people,
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.820]   you quickly recognize that they don't fit the mold
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.660]   of everything we've talked about thus far.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.020]   And in some, I think there's a good argument we made
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.100]   that these are the people that we should spend
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.660]   a lot of our time focusing on.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.820]   When you see somebody get unusual results,
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.860]   it's important to analyze that person
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.940]   in order to understand what does this person do very well?
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.220]   Let's use an example.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.340]   Let's say that you see an incredibly beautiful woman
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.740]   and that beautiful woman is able to attract
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.080]   a movie star husband.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.540]   Well, you look at her and say, well, it's obvious why
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.700]   she was able to attract this movie star husband.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.940]   She's stunningly gorgeous.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.420]   But it's more important for you,
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.360]   and she may have other good qualities as well, of course,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.100]   but it's more important for analysis purposes
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.820]   to find the woman who is not a 10 out of 10
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.580]   in terms of her physical beauty,
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.900]   and yet was still able to attract a movie star husband.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.340]   And ask yourself, what did she do?
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.660]   Who is she?
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.540]   What skills did she develop and exercise
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.420]   in order to attract this phenomenal husband?
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.900]   What was it?
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.740]   And maybe there's an element of randomness to attraction.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.900]   I don't believe it much, but I'm much more interested
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.780]   to say like, to know, how did she treat him?
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.020]   How does she speak?
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.160]   What are her mannerisms?
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.500]   Because those are the things that must have had some impact
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.160]   and influence over her ability to attract him.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.940]   You could use examples from business as well.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.300]   You find a guy who was given,
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.180]   lent a million dollars or $10 million from his father,
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.620]   and he went out and was able to use that,
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.220]   and he went to a great business school,
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.140]   and he started a business,
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.760]   and he turned the $10 million into $100 million.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.100]   Great, congratulations.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.860]   What a phenomenal achievement.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.900]   But it's more interesting to study the case of the guy
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.560]   who grew up in the hood, had no connections, had no money,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.740]   and little by little made his way from $0 to $100 million
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.180]   and figure out what are the character qualities
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.940]   or what are the actions or behaviors that this guy did
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.380]   that allowed him to accomplish it?
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.080]   Because it's truly a far more extraordinary outcome
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.380]   than the guy who was given $10 million
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.460]   by his wealthy parents to go and start a business.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.060]   And these are some of the things that I wanna touch on
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.420]   in this particular part of the series.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.420]   These features of the spirit,
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.340]   these character qualities, these virtues
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.100]   that don't fit beautifully into the structure
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.700]   that we've built so far.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.620]   I wanna begin with reading an excerpt
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.100]   from this book called,
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.020]   this is a book called "How Children Succeed,
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.500]   Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character."
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.820]   The author here is Paul Tuff.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.580]   And in his introduction to the book,
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.140]   he describes exactly what I am talking about.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.300]   In the beginning paragraphs,
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.940]   he describes his newborn son named Ellington.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.540]   And he describes how he's thinking about
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.540]   what is gonna help my son Ellington to be successful,
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.380]   et cetera.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.740]   And he shares this little bit of background to the story.
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.020]   Ellington would be growing up in a culture saturated
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.020]   with an idea you might call the cognitive hypothesis.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.460]   The belief rarely expressed aloud,
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.420]   but commonly held nonetheless,
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.620]   that success today depends primarily on cognitive skills.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.820]   The kind of intelligence that gets measured on IQ tests,
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.420]   including the abilities to recognize letters and words,
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.860]   to calculate, to detect patterns.
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.780]   And that the best way to develop these skills
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.980]   is to practice them as much as possible,
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.100]   beginning as early as possible.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.860]   The cognitive hypothesis has become so universally accepted
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.740]   that it is easy to forget
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.500]   that it is actually a relatively new invention.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.220]   You can trace its contemporary rise in fact to 1994,
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.140]   when the Carnegie Corporation published "Starting Points,"
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.260]   meeting the needs of our youngest children.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.820]   A report that sounded an alarm
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.740]   about the cognitive development of our nation's children.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.500]   The problem, according to the report,
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.340]   was that children were no longer receiving
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.340]   enough cognitive stimulation
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.140]   in the first three years of life.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.820]   In part, because of the increasing number
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.980]   of single parent families and working mothers,
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.700]   and so they were arriving in kindergarten unready to learn.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.100]   The report launched an entire industry of brain building
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.780]   zero to three products for worried parents.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.540]   Billions of dollars worth of books and activity gyms
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.780]   and baby Einstein videos and DVDs were sold.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.640]   The Carnegie findings and the studies
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.700]   that followed in their wake
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.460]   had a powerful effect on public policy too.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.940]   As legislators and philanthropists concluded
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.300]   that disadvantaged children were falling behind early on
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.300]   because of insufficient cognitive training.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.120]   Psychologists and sociologists produced evidence
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.000]   linking the academic underperformance of poor children
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.700]   to a lack of verbal and mathematical stimulation
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.480]   at home and at school.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.080]   One of the most famous of these studies,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.160]   which I wrote about in my first book, "Whatever It Takes,"
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.640]   was conducted by Betty Hart and Todd Risley,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.080]   two child psychologists who, beginning in the 1980s,
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.260]   intensively studied a group of 42 children
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.320]   from professional, working class,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.920]   and welfare families in Kansas City.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.080]   Hart and Risley found that the crucial difference
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.380]   in the children's upbringings
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.420]   and the reason for the divergence in their later outcomes
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.200]   boiled down to one thing,
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.160]   the number of words that the children heard
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.200]   from their parents early in life.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.780]   By age three, Hart and Risley determined,
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.680]   the children raised by professional parents
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.700]   had heard 30 million words spoken to them.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.240]   The children with parents on welfare
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.040]   had heard just 10 million.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.560]   That shortfall they concluded
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.120]   was at the root of the poorer kids' later failures
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.680]   in school and in life.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.720]   There is something undeniably compelling
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.820]   about the cognitive hypothesis.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.820]   The world it describes is so neat, so reassuringly linear,
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.280]   such a clear case of inputs here leading to outputs there.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.160]   Fewer books in the home means less reading ability.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.780]   Fewer words spoken by parents
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.180]   means a smaller vocabulary for their kids.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.600]   More math worksheets at junior come on
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.600]   means better math scores.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.560]   The correlations at times seemed almost comically exact.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.360]   Hart and Risley calculated that a child
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.640]   who grew up on welfare would need precisely
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.200]   41 hours of language intensive intervention each week
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   in order to close the vocabulary gap
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.260]   with a working class child.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.480]   But in the past decade,
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.640]   and especially in the past few years,
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.800]   a disparate congregation of economists, educators,
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.300]   psychologists, and neuroscientists
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.680]   have begun to produce evidence that calls into question
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.060]   many of the assumptions behind the cognitive hypothesis.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.560]   What matters most in a child's development, they say,
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.400]   is not how much information we can stuff into her brain
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.000]   in the first few years.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.380]   What matters instead is whether we are able to help her
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.160]   develop a very different set of qualities,
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.280]   a list that includes persistence, self-control,
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.280]   curiosity, conscientiousness, grit, and self-confidence.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.960]   Economists refer to these as non-cognitive skills.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.840]   Psychologists call them personality traits,
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.120]   and the rest of us sometimes think of them as character.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.220]   For certain skills,
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.820]   the stark calculus behind the cognitive hypothesis
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.640]   that what matters in developing a skill
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.680]   is starting earlier and practicing more is entirely valid.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.060]   If you want to perfect your foul shot,
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.500]   shooting 200 free throws every afternoon
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.480]   is indeed going to be more helpful
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.400]   than shooting 20 free throws every afternoon.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.600]   If you're in fourth grade,
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.560]   reading 40 books over the summer
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.760]   is going to improve your reading ability
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.640]   more than reading four books.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.720]   Some skills really are pretty mechanical,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.140]   but when it comes to developing the more subtle elements
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.720]   of the human personality, things aren't so simple.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.240]   We can't get better at overcoming disappointment
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.000]   just by working harder at it for more hours,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.660]   and children don't lag behind in curiosity
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.320]   simply because they didn't start doing curiosity drills
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.080]   at an early enough age.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.240]   The pathways through which we acquire and lose these skills
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.920]   are certainly not random.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.900]   Psychologists and neuroscientists have learned a lot
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.600]   in the past few decades about where these skills come from
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.360]   and how they are developed,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.880]   but they are complex, unfamiliar,
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.720]   and often quite mysterious.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.600]   A little bit later in the introduction,
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.360]   after being introduced to a man named Heckman,
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.840]   we are given an introduction
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.540]   to something called the PERI project.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.400]   What the GED study didn't give Heckman
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.240]   was any indication of whether it was possible
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.040]   to help children develop those so-called soft skills.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.680]   His search for an answer to that question
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.200]   led him, almost a decade ago, to Ypsilanti, Michigan,
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.000]   an old industrial town west of Detroit.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.840]   In the mid-1960s, in the early days of the war on poverty,
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.280]   a group of child psychologists and education researchers
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.080]   undertook an experiment there,
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.080]   recruiting low-income, low-IQ parents
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.000]   from the town's black neighborhoods
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.280]   to sign up their three- and four-year-old kids
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.080]   for the PERI preschool.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.080]   The recruited children were divided randomly
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.140]   into a treatment group and a control group.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.800]   Children in the treatment group were admitted to PERI,
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.400]   a high-quality, two-year preschool program,
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.920]   and kids in the control group
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   were left to fend for themselves.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.560]   And then the children were tracked,
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.440]   not just for a year or two, but for decades,
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.800]   in an ongoing study that is intended to follow them
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.640]   for the rest of their lives.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.180]   The subjects are now in their 40s,
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.840]   which means that researchers have been able
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.400]   to trace the effects of the PERI intervention
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.640]   well into adulthood.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.440]   The PERI preschool project is famous
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.880]   in social science circles,
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.440]   and Heckman had encountered it, glancingly,
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.040]   several times before in his career.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.840]   As a case for early childhood intervention,
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.680]   the experiment had always been considered
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.360]   something of a failure.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.860]   The treatment children did do significantly better
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.880]   on cognitive tests while attending the preschool,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.520]   and for a year or two afterward,
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.560]   but the gains did not last.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.120]   And by the time the treatment children
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.040]   were in the third grade,
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.340]   their IQ scores were no better than the control groups.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.360]   But when Heckman and other researchers
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.540]   looked at the long-term results of PERI,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.040]   the data appeared more promising.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.160]   It was true that the PERI kids
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.560]   hadn't experienced lasting IQ benefits,
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.320]   but something important had happened to them in preschool,
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.600]   and whatever it was,
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.840]   the positive effects resonated for decades.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.240]   Compared to the control group,
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.740]   the PERI students were more likely
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.280]   to graduate from high school,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.960]   more likely to be employed at age 27,
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.120]   more likely to be earning more than $25,000 a year at age 40,
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.200]   less likely ever to have been arrested,
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.600]   and less likely to have spent time on welfare.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.400]   Heckman began to rummage more deeply into the PERI study,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.600]   and he learned that in the 1960s and 1970s,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.120]   researchers had collected some data on the students
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.860]   that had never been analyzed,
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.920]   reports from teachers in elementary school
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.440]   rating both the treatment and the control children
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.180]   on personal behavior and social development.
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.040]   The first term tracked how often each student swore,
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.880]   lied, stole, or was absent or late.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.600]   The second one rated each student's level of curiosity
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.160]   as well as his or her relationships
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.320]   with classmates and teachers.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.160]   Heckman labeled these non-cognitive skills
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.480]   because they were entirely distinct from IQ.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.920]   And after three years of careful analysis,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.200]   Heckman and his researchers were able to ascertain
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.480]   that those non-cognitive factors,
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.480]   such as curiosity, self-control, and social fluidity,
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.640]   were responsible for as much as two thirds
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.860]   of the total benefit that PERI gave its students.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.420]   The PERI preschool project, in other words,
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.100]   worked entirely differently than everyone had believed.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.720]   The good-hearted educators who set it up in the '60s
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.000]   thought that they were creating a program
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.860]   to raise the intelligence of low-income children.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.560]   They, like everyone else, believed that was the way
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   to help poor kids get ahead in America.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.920]   Surprise number one was that they created a program
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.400]   that didn't do much in the long term for IQ,
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.920]   but did improve behavior and social skills.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.780]   Surprise number two was that it helped anyway.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.120]   For the kids in Ypsilanti, those skills
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.480]   and the underlying traits they reflected
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.760]   turned out to be very valuable indeed.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.200]   Now, if you're interested in reading the book,
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   the book, again, is called "How Children Succeed,
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.080]   "Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character."
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.600]   And the author, again, is Paul Tuff.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.360]   This is one of probably two of the most well-known books
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.200]   in this space.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.760]   The other really well-known book is a book called
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.880]   "Grit, The Power of Passion and Perseverance"
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.880]   by Angela Duckworth, which talks a lot about
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.720]   the importance of grit,
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.840]   which will be my first thing that I talk about.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.760]   Now, I've struggled to figure out the scope
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.800]   of what I want to share with you here on the podcast,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.400]   because certainly if somebody were offering today
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:44.260]   a five-day seminar on how to develop these soft skills
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.600]   in children, I would be signing up.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.200]   These two books that I've mentioned combined
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.520]   are probably what, 800 pages, I would say.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.200]   And I am not an expert in this space.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.560]   And what's more challenging is I'm humbled
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.200]   by my own personal results in these areas.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.360]   I'm generally satisfied with my work as a parent,
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.320]   with the development of my children's bodies,
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.400]   with the development of my children's minds,
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.320]   and I'm dissatisfied with my work as a parent
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.280]   in the developing of my children's spirits
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.060]   on some of these dimensions.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.600]   I'm working hard at it, but I'm quite humbled
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.240]   at a lot of my failures in this area.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.320]   And I desire very much to be the student,
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.900]   not to be the teacher.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.280]   So in that spirit, I'm going to present to you some ideas
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.840]   that I think are the correct direction to be looking,
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.880]   but I don't have as many good answers
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.840]   in this area of discussion as I have
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.020]   in some of the other areas that we've discussed.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.360]   I'm very much learning, and I hope I can come back
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.200]   in a year or two years or three years or 10 years
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.360]   and have a lot more insight into some of the specific things
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.680]   that are important.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.380]   And so with that in mind and in that spirit,
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.560]   I wanna share with you some things
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.320]   that I think really matter.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.120]   And just for the sake of organizing my own thinking,
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:09.120]   I think about this in terms of installing the skills
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.600]   of success or installing the mindset of success,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.480]   stability and significance.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.180]   And I wanna give a metaphor for how I consider this.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.700]   I think of this particular area of our work as parents
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.360]   as simply installing a high quality operating system
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.240]   into the minds of our children.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.040]   That's how I think of it.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.800]   And obviously it's the computer analogy.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.840]   By way of the computer analogy,
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.360]   we have the physical infrastructure of a computer
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.020]   that is going to determine its ultimate capability.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.540]   And then we install the operating system.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.300]   And body, what we talked about in terms of body
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.100]   was the physical infrastructure of our children
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.020]   on a very physical level.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.820]   When we started to talk about the mind,
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.420]   that is a physical development discussion,
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.840]   but then we're moving over into enhancing the ability
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.780]   to run more powerful software, et cetera.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.380]   But in this area where we're talking about the spirit,
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.740]   we're very much talking about software.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.020]   We're talking about the way that our children
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.460]   interpret life and the things that happen to them.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.300]   And having been a student of this,
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.020]   from my own psychology for a long time,
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.180]   I consider this to be one of the most fruitful areas
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.420]   of discussion for us as adults,
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:33.140]   because the software operating system that we have
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.820]   is something that was usually given to us.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.900]   And yet it's something that we can systematically
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:42.540]   pull apart, we can choose the things that are useful to us,
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.860]   and we can set aside the things that are not.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.580]   None of us are victims of our childhood,
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.480]   unless we choose to continue to be victims of our childhood.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.180]   We get to take the experiences that we have had
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.840]   and interpret them in a very different light.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.860]   I'd like to persuade you of this point with a story
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.380]   and just a quick introduction.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.540]   This comes from, to me, the most powerful story
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.580]   that is contained in the book called
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.660]   "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.580]   "Powerful Lessons in Personal Change."
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.100]   It's a classic personal development book
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.740]   by Stephen R. Covey.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.120]   And in this section, he talks about
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.860]   the power of a paradigm shift.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.740]   Perhaps the most important insight to be gained
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.220]   from the perception demonstration
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.240]   is in the area of paradigm shifting,
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.860]   what we might call the aha experience,
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.940]   when someone finally sees the composite picture
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.340]   in another way.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.360]   The more bound a person is by the initial perception,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.900]   the more powerful the aha experience is.
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.180]   It's as though a light were suddenly turned on inside.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.500]   The term paradigm shift was introduced by Thomas Kuhn
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.540]   in his highly influential landmark book,
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.020]   "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions."
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.780]   Kuhn shows how almost every significant breakthrough
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.760]   in the field of scientific endeavor
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.140]   is first a break with tradition,
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.820]   with old ways of thinking, with old paradigms.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.100]   For Ptolemy, the great Egyptian astronomer,
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.380]   the earth was the center of the universe,
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.900]   but Copernicus created a paradigm shift
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.460]   and a great deal of resistance and persecution as well
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.700]   by placing the sun at the center.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.820]   Suddenly, everything took on a different interpretation.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.700]   The Newtonian model of physics was a clockwork paradigm
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.380]   and is still the basis of modern engineering,
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.740]   but it was partial, incomplete.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.960]   The scientific world was revolutionized
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.100]   by the Einsteinian paradigm,
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.460]   the relativity paradigm,
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.180]   which had much higher predictive and explanatory value.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.180]   Until the germ theory was developed,
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.060]   a high percentage of women and children died
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.320]   during childbirth and no one could understand why.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.560]   In military skirmishes,
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.820]   more men were dying from small wounds and diseases
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.620]   than from the major traumas on the front lines.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.500]   But as soon as germ theory was developed,
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.860]   a whole new paradigm,
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.100]   a better improved way of understanding what was happening,
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.140]   made dramatic, significant medical improvement possible.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.460]   The United States today is the fruit of a paradigm shift.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.500]   The traditional concept of government for centuries
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.060]   had been a monarchy, the divine right of kings.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.340]   Then a different paradigm was developed,
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.340]   government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.780]   And a constitutional democracy was born,
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.820]   unleashing tremendous human energy and ingenuity
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.020]   and creating a standard of living, of freedom and liberty,
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.680]   of influence and hope unequaled in the history of the world.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.500]   Not all paradigm shifts are in positive directions.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.540]   As we have observed,
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.580]   the shift from the character ethic to the personality ethic
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.620]   has drawn us away from the very roots
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.440]   that nourish true success and happiness.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.160]   But whether they shift us in positive or negative directions,
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.140]   whether they are instantaneous or developmental,
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.020]   paradigm shifts move us
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.820]   from one way of seeing the world to another.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.300]   And those shifts create powerful change.
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.340]   Our paradigms, correct or incorrect,
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.620]   are the sources of our attitudes and behaviors
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.940]   and ultimately our relationships with others.
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.020]   I remember a mini paradigm shift
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.920]   that I experienced one Sunday morning
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.780]   on a subway in New York.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.900]   People were sitting quietly, some reading newspapers,
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.940]   some lost in thought, some resting with their eyes closed.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.740]   It was a calm, peaceful scene.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.180]   Then suddenly a man and his children entered the subway car.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.180]   The children were so loud and rambunctious
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.500]   that instantly the whole climate changed.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.580]   The man sat down next to me and closed his eyes,
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.220]   apparently oblivious to the situation.
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.180]   The children were yelling back and forth, throwing things,
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.620]   even grabbing people's papers.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.300]   It was very disturbing.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.100]   And yet the man sitting next to me did nothing.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.660]   It was difficult not to feel irritated.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.020]   I could not believe that he could be so insensitive
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.100]   as to let his children run wild like that
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.340]   and do nothing about it, taking no responsibility at all.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.260]   It was easy to see that everyone else on the subway
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.900]   felt irritated too.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.300]   So finally, with what I felt was unusual patience
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.780]   and restraint, I turned to him and said,
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.860]   "Sir, your children are really disturbing a lot of people.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.340]   "I wonder if you couldn't control them a little more?"
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.960]   The man lifted his gaze as if to come to a consciousness
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.760]   of the situation for the first time and said softly,
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.860]   "Oh, you're right.
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.940]   "I guess I should do something about it.
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.080]   "We just came from the hospital where their mother died
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.700]   "about an hour ago.
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.240]   "I don't know what to think,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.220]   "and I guess they don't know how to handle it either."
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:40.180]   Can you imagine what I felt at that moment?
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.460]   My paradigm shifted.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.900]   Suddenly I saw things differently.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.640]   And because I saw differently, I thought differently.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.780]   I felt differently.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.580]   I behaved differently.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.260]   My irritation vanished.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.500]   I didn't have to worry about controlling my attitude
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.740]   or my behavior.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.080]   My heart was filled with the man's pain.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.380]   Feelings of sympathy and compassion flowed freely.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.820]   "Your wife just died?
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.020]   "I'm so sorry.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.040]   "Can you tell me about it?
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.660]   "What can I do to help?"
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.260]   Everything changed in an instant.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.600]   Now Covey goes on and continues that theme.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.580]   But for me, that story is one that is burned
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.860]   in my memory as the most powerful example
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.540]   of a relatively instant paradigm shift.
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.780]   And I hope that,
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.860]   especially if it's the first time
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.820]   you've been exposed to it,
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.600]   I hope it does the same for you.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.540]   We realize in an instant
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.100]   that though the outward circumstances
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.680]   are completely unchanged,
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.380]   our attitude about those circumstances is different.
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.180]   And this is extraordinarily powerful for us as adults
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.340]   is to practice imposing on ourselves
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.300]   ways of thinking that are helpful,
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.060]   that are useful to us
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.860]   in accomplishing our long-term goals.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.220]   Now, I am imperfect at this.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.460]   I'd like to be better.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.860]   I'm sure in 10 years I will be much better.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.060]   But one of the ways I do it
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.420]   is to focus on just little sayings.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.700]   You've heard me say on the podcast,
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.020]   sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.000]   Sometimes you win and sometimes you learn.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.020]   That's a powerful way to affect your thinking,
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.780]   to recognize that I win and I learn.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.380]   Losses are simply learning.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.860]   And here we talk about the importance of failure
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.420]   in a bit as we get through
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.540]   some of what I have planned to share with you.
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.060]   And in your life,
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.500]   there are so many things you can do.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.980]   I'm amazed at,
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.660]   a good example would be traffic incidents.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.140]   Perhaps all of us have,
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.300]   I'm sure all of us,
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.100]   if someone has done something in traffic
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.660]   or treated us in a way that was rude
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.280]   and just made us frustrated
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.980]   and we instantly felt that surge of emotion
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.660]   pour over us and we wanted to react and lash out.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.780]   And yet how stupid would that be
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.120]   to surge, to lash out,
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.900]   to engage in some road rage incident
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.600]   and find ourselves imprisoned
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.540]   or paying a fine or causing an accident
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.800]   or causing harm to another human in some way
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.700]   because of an example.
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.680]   And so one of the things I try to do
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   is always assume the very best.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.000]   All of us have inadvertently done something in traffic
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.840]   that we didn't mean to.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.600]   Cut someone else off,
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   disobeyed a rule, et cetera.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.480]   And so I have worked to train myself
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.060]   to do two things.
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.140]   Number one,
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.560]   to always assume that the other person
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.800]   just inadvertently made a mistake.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.860]   Oh, they didn't see me.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.900]   That's why they cut me off.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.100]   Or the guy's in a hurry.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.120]   He has something really important.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.200]   And in the same way that the story on the subway,
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.040]   I've just said,
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.680]   if you just to say that the reason that guy
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.080]   is driving like a maniac
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.760]   is not because that's some kid
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.040]   who just drives like a maniac,
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.160]   but rather there's a guy who has a dying wife in the car
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.400]   and he's trying to get her to the hospital
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.440]   or a birthing wife or something like that,
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.520]   he's gotta go.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.360]   Then it changes your attitude.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.160]   And it doesn't matter whether it's true.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.960]   It could be true or it could not be true.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.440]   What matters is that it changes your way of thinking.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.500]   And then simultaneous with that,
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.020]   I have a big commitment to the basic idea of,
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.860]   am I gonna remember this in 10 years or 20 years?
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.760]   Or is this gonna matter in 10 years or 20 years?
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.600]   I ask myself,
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.900]   is this experience that I'm going through,
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.060]   is it gonna matter in 20 years?
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.620]   Am I gonna be upset about this in 20 years?
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.340]   If I'm not gonna be upset about this in 20 years,
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.380]   then why don't I just skip that?
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.220]   Skip there, right?
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.060]   Let me go right to 20 years from now and just assume that.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:31.900]   I'm not gonna remember
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.980]   that someone cut me off 20 years from now.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.860]   I'm not gonna be upset about the fact
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.380]   that my tent is full of water
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.740]   and it's a miserable night.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.740]   I'm gonna laugh about it.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.460]   So why not just go ahead and skip forward and laugh now?
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.380]   'Cause as human beings, we can control our minds.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.700]   We can control our thoughts.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.460]   It's one of the very few things in the world
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.180]   that we have control over.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.460]   We can't control our external world.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.180]   We can't control the people around us.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.860]   We can't control the circumstances in which we are.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.180]   But we can control our minds.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.820]   We can control the thoughts that we choose to think.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.460]   And so this is fundamentally useful.
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.500]   It's a useful way of thinking.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.340]   And we should be dedicated to training ourselves
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.060]   to adopt these useful ways of thinking.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.340]   One more example.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.820]   In interpersonal relationships,
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.260]   I believe it's always important
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.260]   to believe the best about other people.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.580]   I was taught this myself as a child,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.540]   both explicitly in religious instruction,
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.140]   as well as by example, by the example of my parents.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.780]   And in Christianity, this comes from 1 Corinthians 13,
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.420]   the famous chapter on love.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.220]   But it says that love believes all things,
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.420]   looking for the best in each one.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.420]   That this is what love does.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.580]   And so if we're going to love another man,
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.060]   that means that I need to believe him.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.660]   I need to believe the best.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.980]   I need to always order things.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.140]   Love believes all things.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.220]   It hopes all things.
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.420]   It endures all things.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.940]   And so we believe the best about each one,
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.580]   regardless of what comes.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.860]   We bear with one another.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.340]   We hope all things, always holding out hope
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.740]   that for the very best possible,
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.140]   we endure all things without weakening.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.420]   That's what it means to love another person.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.220]   And so when we apply this in human relationships,
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.180]   the practical application is,
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.180]   you always believe the very best version
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.820]   of the circumstances that are in front of you.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.380]   If somebody comes to you and you're not sure
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.180]   if they're telling you the truth or if they're lying,
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.060]   believe the best.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.900]   Believe them.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.380]   Believe they're telling you the truth.
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.300]   If somebody comes to you and says he's sincere,
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.860]   then believe that he's sincere.
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.660]   Don't automatically assume he's insincere
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.780]   and cast him aside.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.780]   Believe the very best.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.180]   This is not to be naive.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.380]   If there is evidence that somebody is lying,
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.980]   then you believe the very best about the evidence.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.380]   If there's evidence that someone's lying,
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.580]   you believe they're lying,
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.380]   but you believe that they may not have meant to lie.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.300]   They may not have intended to lie.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.060]   They may have been blackmailed into lying.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.780]   You look for the very best explanation.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.380]   And this is a magical transformative belief.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.660]   It's a magical transformative practice
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.500]   because it takes your interpersonal relationships.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.420]   And instead of you sitting back and judging other people
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.740]   and talking about how they're wrong,
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.140]   you're always putting them in the best possible light.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.340]   And this helps people to feel good.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.740]   And what happens is when people feel good about themselves,
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.220]   or when people feel good about you
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.580]   and they feel good about themselves,
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.580]   it leads to more positive human relationships.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.660]   And so these software programs,
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.980]   or these lines of code that we put into our mind
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.100]   have a fundamentally powerful impact
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.100]   on our lives as adults.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.860]   And these are all components of the lessons
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.140]   that we need to teach our children,
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.940]   consistently teach our children.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.220]   And this principle is something that you can take
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:02.220]   and you can apply in many, many ways.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.580]   So let me just cover some big picture discussions.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.700]   As I said, I feel willfully inadequate
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.100]   in presenting these ideas to you
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.260]   because this is deserving of a week long seminar
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.900]   and I'm not yet capable of delivering that seminar.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.460]   So let me just share some high level ideas,
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.020]   starting with success.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.100]   - Now for a limited time

[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.140]   from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally,
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.060]   you're not going to find a better deal
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.900]   on front row seats to a championship winner.

[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.980]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports of Orange County

[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.060]   - So we're trying to instill
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.900]   a high quality operating system of success.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:00.180]   Here, the world of things are very, very important,
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.180]   but here are some of the ones that are most important to me.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:08.060]   The first has to do with persistence or grit.
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.460]   This is again, the title of Angela Duckworth's book, "Grit."
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.140]   And if I had to summarize her findings
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.220]   is basically people who have grit overcome no matter what.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.300]   And I've observed this so many times.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.780]   If you think about the people who win in the longterm,
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.180]   it's people who have grit.
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.260]   They just kind of ignore what happens
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.340]   and they keep on going.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.700]   And this persistence, this grit
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:35.020]   that represents somebody's determination to continue
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.500]   no matter the odds, their passion, their motivation
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.700]   to continue pressing through,
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.980]   this separates people in the fullness of time
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.700]   from everyone else.
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.700]   And it basically is a belief that what I'm doing matters
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.740]   and if I just keep going, it'll work.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.500]   This is something that I personally believe
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.540]   and it's something that I use for myself
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.620]   and I hope to install into my children.
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.620]   My belief is this, I'm not the smartest guy out there.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.420]   I'm not the most capable guy out there.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.660]   I have all kinds of weaknesses, just like everybody else.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.940]   I do believe everyone has these weaknesses,
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:18.940]   but as long as I don't quit, my success is inevitable.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.220]   As long as I don't quit, my success is inevitable
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.820]   because the only thing that can keep me
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.020]   from achieving success in an area
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:33.020]   that I have applied myself to is if I quit.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.220]   And this forms the foundation of my basic operating system
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.860]   for goal achievement.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:43.620]   I have failed on so many goals that I have set for myself.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:46.580]   I have virtually never hit a deadline
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.900]   or a target date of accomplishment.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.660]   I virtually never do that.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.740]   My success is in anything.
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:58.460]   I've almost never bat 100%, meaning I do this every day.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.780]   This is something that I do every day.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.660]   I virtually never do that,
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.780]   but I pride myself on I never quit.
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.380]   And so I might set out on a plan and say,
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.580]   you know, I don't know, right now I'm learning Greek.
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.620]   So I might say, you know what,
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.700]   my goal is in one year I'm gonna learn Greek
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.580]   and I'm gonna be able to read
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:18.220]   the Koine Greek New Testament with some degree of fluidity.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.580]   I might achieve it or I might not, I don't know.
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.020]   We're four months into the project,
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.540]   I'm behind schedule as usual.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:28.540]   But I know that as long as I don't quit,
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.740]   I'll achieve it eventually.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.020]   And it doesn't matter whether it takes me one year
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.820]   or 10 years or 60 years.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.180]   I might be an old man sitting in the back
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.220]   on my back porch in my rocking chair
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.420]   and I'll be steadily working my way
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.620]   through the accomplishment of this goal.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.220]   Because as long as I don't quit,
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:50.140]   I'm guaranteed to be successful, guaranteed.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.300]   Doesn't matter whether it takes me twice as long
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.700]   as everyone else or half the time as everyone else,
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.220]   the important thing is that I don't quit.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.580]   I consider this an incredibly powerful operating system,
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.500]   an incredibly powerful thing.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.620]   It motivates me, it inspires me,
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.340]   because what it does is simply takes away from me
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:15.300]   every excuse as to why I can't do something.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.180]   And it keeps me in a position of power.
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.900]   It keeps me in the position to say, I gotta do it.
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.740]   And by the way, it doesn't even matter if I quit.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.780]   I've quit so many things, tons of times.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.180]   All that matters is if I decide I wanna do it again,
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.500]   I unquit.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.780]   Quitting is something you can do in an instant.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.940]   And it doesn't matter whether you've quit
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.780]   and unquit a hundred times before,
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.580]   what matters is that you quit again.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.820]   Or sorry, whatever, if we're talking about giving up
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.060]   negative things or positive things,
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.340]   the point is that it's just a decision.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.580]   You don't have to continue, you just decide and stop.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.260]   There's no reason to ascribe more meaning to it
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.420]   than anything else.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:59.380]   You wouldn't tell, you don't tell a guy who's,
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.940]   I don't know, who's failed at college
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.620]   and he's failed out five times.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.500]   You don't tell him, yeah, you just better quit
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.540]   for the rest of your life.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.740]   If you ask him, do you wanna finish college?
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.460]   And he says, yeah, I wanna finish college.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.340]   All right, well, we gotta figure something else out
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.260]   'cause we've just learned five things
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.580]   that haven't worked for you.
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.940]   So we gotta find a new solution, but we're not gonna quit.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.540]   And what happens is we tell stories about our heroes.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.660]   We tell stories about Thomas Edison
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.860]   who tried 10,000 things and they said,
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.900]   how do you feel after trying 10,000 things?
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.340]   And aren't you a failure?
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.060]   And he says, no, I've just found 10,000 things
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:31.980]   that won't work.
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.420]   But then we failed often to turn around
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.060]   and apply it to our own lives.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:41.060]   But that's a powerful principle, it's a powerful software.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.620]   The guy who refuses to quit ever
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.820]   is the guy who's eventually gonna get there.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.420]   And once you articulate this principle clearly,
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.020]   you see it everywhere in society.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:54.220]   You see it in the stories that we tell of our heroes,
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:59.220]   whether it's Einstein or some indomitable military hero,
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.780]   we tell it in Aesop's fables,
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.740]   the fable of the tortoise and the hare.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.460]   And so what I think we need to do for children
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.420]   is identify these things explicitly
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.140]   and install into them the ideas
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.780]   that these basic character qualities
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.620]   and grit and persistence and not giving up
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:24.540]   are the fundamental components of long-term success.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.660]   Another one that is extremely important to me
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.580]   is a growth mindset.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.180]   This again is made famous in recent days
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:37.180]   by a book by, is it Dweck, Carol Dweck, I think,
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.140]   who wrote a book called "Mindset, Growth Mindset."
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.340]   Yeah, "Mindset, the New Psychology of Success"
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.500]   by Carol Dweck.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.340]   And this, again, if I had to summarize this book
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.940]   in a sentence, it's basically,
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.020]   if you see yourself as on a journey to growth
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.380]   and you continue growing, you're unbeatable.
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.140]   That's the mindset we need to have.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.140]   And so with regard to our children,
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.700]   I think we want to install in them a growth mindset.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:05.100]   We want to help them see themselves as learners,
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.020]   people who are not on a journey
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.500]   that's going to end at a certain day
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.460]   and they're gonna develop this fixed mindset,
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:13.460]   the contrast is between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset,
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.140]   but rather see themselves as people who are growing,
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.420]   who are expanding, and this is a lifelong joy.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.540]   And this process of growth
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:24.600]   is going to fundamentally transform them
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.820]   because they believe in it.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.620]   Let me take a moment here and read you an excerpt
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.340]   from the introduction of the book to make this clear.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.460]   I had not planned to cover it, but I wanna cover it.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.680]   And so reading from "Mindset" by Carol Dweck.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.780]   "What does all this mean for you, the two mindsets?
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.220]   It's one thing to have pundits spouting their opinions
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.780]   about scientific issues.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.980]   It's another thing to understand
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.540]   how these views apply to you.
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.820]   For 20 years, my research has shown
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.560]   that the view you adopt for yourself
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.060]   profoundly affects the way you lead your life.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.460]   It can determine whether you become
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.980]   the person you want to be
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.820]   and whether you accomplish the things you value.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.180]   How does this happen?
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.140]   How can a simple belief have the power
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:11.140]   to transform your psychology and, as a result, your life?
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.460]   Believing that your qualities are carved in stone,
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.380]   the fixed mindset, creates an urgency
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.460]   to prove yourself over and over.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.540]   If you have only a certain amount of intelligence,
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.240]   a certain personality, and a certain moral character,
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.340]   well, then you'd better prove
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.980]   that you have a healthy dose of them.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.260]   It simply wouldn't do to look or feel deficient
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.500]   in these most basic characteristics.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.500]   Some of us are trained in this mindset from an early age.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.420]   Even as a child, I was focused on being smart,
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.260]   but the fixed mindset was really stamped in
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.940]   by Mrs. Wilson, my sixth grade teacher.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.500]   Unlike Alfred Bennett, she believed that people's IQ scores
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.740]   told the whole story of who they were.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.100]   We were seated around the room in IQ order,
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.780]   and only the highest IQ students
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.580]   could be trusted to carry the flag,
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.380]   clap the erasers, or take a note to the principal.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.700]   Aside from the daily stomach aches she provoked
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.380]   with her judgmental stance,
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.060]   she was creating a mindset in which everyone in the class
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:07.820]   had one consuming goal, look smart, don't look dumb.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.580]   Who cared about or enjoyed learning
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.980]   when our whole being was at stake
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.400]   every time she gave us a test or called on us in class?
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.100]   I've seen so many people with this one consuming goal
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.980]   of proving themselves in the classroom, in their careers,
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.540]   and in their relationships.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.060]   Every situation calls for a confirmation
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.580]   of their intelligence, personality, or character.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.740]   Every situation is evaluated.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.380]   Will I succeed or fail?
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.180]   Will I look smart or dumb?
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.260]   Will I be accepted or rejected?
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.820]   Will I feel like a winner or a loser?
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.820]   But doesn't our society value intelligence,
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.220]   personality, and character?
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.700]   Isn't it normal to want these traits?
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.980]   Yes, but there's another mindset in which these traits
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.660]   are not simply a hand you're dealt and have to live with,
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.860]   always trying to convince yourself and others
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.300]   that you have a royal flush when you're secretly worried
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.740]   it's a pair of 10s.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.500]   In this mindset, the hand you're dealt
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.900]   is just the starting point for development.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.160]   This growth mindset is based on the belief
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.500]   that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.820]   through your efforts.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.420]   Although people may differ in every which way,
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.500]   in their initial talents and aptitudes,
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.540]   interests, or temperaments, everyone can change
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.220]   and grow through application and experience.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.740]   Do people with this mindset believe
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.500]   that anyone can be anything?
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.940]   That anyone with proper motivation or education
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.420]   can become Einstein or Beethoven?
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.380]   No, but they believe that a person's true potential
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:30.260]   is unknown and unknowable, that it's impossible
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.020]   to foresee what can be accomplished
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:35.100]   with years of passion, toil, and training.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.820]   Did you know that Darwin and Tolstoy
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.100]   were considered ordinary children?
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.700]   That Ben Hogan, one of the greatest golfers of all time,
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:45.300]   was completely uncoordinated and graceless as a child?
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.780]   That the photographer Cindy Sherman,
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.180]   who has been on virtually every list
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.380]   of the most important artists of the 20th century,
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.820]   failed her first photography course?
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.540]   That Geraldine Page, one of our greatest actresses,
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.380]   was advised to give it up for lack of talent?
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.140]   You can see how the belief that cherished qualities
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.900]   can be developed creates a passion for learning.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.900]   Why waste time proving over and over how great you are
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.500]   when you could be getting better?
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.220]   Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them?
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.740]   Why look for friends or partners
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.940]   who will just shore up your self-esteem
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.420]   instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow?
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.620]   And why seek out the tried and true
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.060]   instead of experiences that will stretch you?
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.820]   The passion for stretching yourself
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.500]   and sticking to it even, or especially,
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:27.900]   when it's not going well,
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.300]   is the hallmark of the growth mindset.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.220]   This is the mindset that allows people to thrive
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.540]   during some of the most challenging times in their lives.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.620]   Now for a limited time
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.740]   at Del Amo Motorsports of Orange County.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:43.420]   Get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months

[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.260]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.740]   from King of the Hammers
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.660]   to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally,
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.540]   you're not going to find a better deal
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.420]   on front row seats to a championship winner.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.340]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.460]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports of Orange County
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.380]   in Santa Ana and get yours.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.700]   Offer in soon, see dealer for details.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.180]   A view from the two mindsets.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.620]   To give you a better sense of how the two mindsets work,
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.740]   imagine as vividly as you can
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.180]   that you are a young adult having a really bad day.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.940]   One day you go to a class that is really important to you
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.300]   and that you like a lot.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.300]   The professor returns the midterm papers to the class.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.140]   You got a C plus.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.660]   You're very disappointed.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.620]   That evening on your way back to your home,
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.140]   you find that you've gotten a parking ticket.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.420]   Being really frustrated,
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.580]   you call your best friend to share your experience
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.820]   but are sort of brushed off.
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.180]   What would you think?
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.740]   What would you feel?
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:42.860]   What would you do?
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.900]   When I ask people with a fixed mindset,
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.420]   this is what they said.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.300]   I'd feel like a reject.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.460]   I'm a total failure.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.300]   I'm an idiot.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.900]   I'm a loser.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.460]   I'd feel worthless and dumb.
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.460]   Everyone's better than me.
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.500]   I'm slime.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.380]   In other words, they'd see what happened
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.420]   as a direct measure of their competence and worth.
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.500]   This is what they think about their lives.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.220]   My life is pitiful.
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.860]   I have no life.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.380]   Somebody upstairs doesn't like me.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.540]   The world is out to get me.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.820]   Someone is out to destroy me.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.500]   Nobody loves me.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.420]   Everybody hates me.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.020]   Life is unfair and all efforts are useless.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.540]   Life stinks.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.140]   I'm stupid.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.620]   Nothing good ever happens to me.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:34.300]   I'm the most unlucky person on this earth.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.340]   Excuse me?
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.660]   Was there death and destruction or just a grade,
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.780]   a ticket and a bad phone call?
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:43.180]   Are these just people with low self-esteem
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.300]   or card-carrying pessimists?
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.140]   No.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.060]   When they aren't coping with failure,
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.460]   they feel just as worthy and optimistic
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.620]   and bright and attractive as people with a growth mindset.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.620]   So how would they cope?
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.700]   I wouldn't bother to put so much time and effort
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.420]   into doing well in anything.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.940]   In other words, don't let anyone measure you again.
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.060]   Do nothing.
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.420]   Stay in bed.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.740]   Get drunk.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:06.580]   Eat.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.580]   Yell at someone if I get a chance to.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:09.740]   Eat chocolate.
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.300]   Listen to music and pout.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.220]   Go into my closet and sit there.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.900]   Pick a fight with somebody.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.020]   Cry.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.460]   Break something.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.300]   What is there to do?
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.940]   What is there to do?
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.380]   You know, when I wrote the vignette,
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.540]   I intentionally made the grade a C plus, not an F.
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.220]   It was a midterm rather than a final.
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.500]   It was a parking ticket, not a car wreck.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.460]   They were sort of brushed off, not rejected outright.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.540]   Nothing catastrophic or irreversible happened.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.180]   Yet from this raw material,
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.060]   the fixed mindset creates the feeling
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.700]   of utter failure and paralysis.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.020]   When I gave people with a growth mindset the same vignette,
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.260]   here's what they said.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.180]   They'd think, "I need to try harder in class,
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:51.020]   "be more careful when parking the car,
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.780]   "and wonder if my friend had a bad day."
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.820]   The C plus would tell me
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.500]   that I'd have to work a lot harder in the class,
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.460]   but I have the rest of the semester to pull up my grade.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.300]   There were many, many more like this,
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.140]   but I think you get the idea.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.020]   Now, how would they cope?
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.300]   Directly.
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.420]   I'd start thinking about studying harder
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:10.900]   or studying in a different way
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.980]   for my next test in that class.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.620]   I'd pay the ticket and I'd work things out
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.100]   with my best friend the next time we speak.
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.140]   I'd look at what was wrong on my exam,
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.740]   resolve to do better, pay my parking ticket,
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:25.300]   and call my friend to tell her I was upset the day before.
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.120]   Work hard on my next paper, speak to the teacher,
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.940]   be more careful where I park or contest the ticket,
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.660]   and find out what's wrong with my friend.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.540]   You don't have to have one mindset
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.140]   or the other to be upset.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.380]   Who wouldn't be?
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:39.660]   Things like a poor grade
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:41.460]   or a rebuff from a friend or loved one,
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.200]   these are not fun events.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.780]   No one was smacking their lips with relish.
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.660]   Yet those people with the growth mindset
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.740]   were not labeling themselves and throwing up their hands.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.220]   Even though they felt distressed,
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.980]   they were ready to take the risks,
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.460]   confront the challenges, and keep working at them.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.140]   So if that sounds interesting to you,
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.780]   I commend the rest of the book to you,
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.980]   again, called "Mindset" by Carol Dweck.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.980]   But the point is that you can take events
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.380]   and you can interpret them in two different ways.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:12.760]   And one way, as you could see,
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.200]   is healthy and leads to good outcomes.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.160]   The guy who says, "I gotta study harder,
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.660]   "be more careful where I park,
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.080]   "and try to reach out to my friend another time,"
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.200]   is a guy who's ultimately gonna wind up passing the class,
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.880]   probably get a B plus, an A minus when he does better,
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.240]   figure out a solution,
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.840]   he's gonna have a healthy friendship,
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.120]   and he's gonna learn that it's always cheaper
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.400]   to just feed the meter than it is to pay the ticket.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.920]   But these are no big deal.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.080]   The guy with the growth mindset is gonna get drunk,
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.580]   he's gonna destroy a relationship with a friend,
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:45.580]   and, or get fat, and everything is gonna get worse,
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:48.780]   he's gonna drop out of the class and not learn anything.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.460]   So giving our children this growth mindset
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:57.140]   from an early age, I think is fundamentally important.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.960]   Other components of this, right?
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.740]   Teaching about passion.
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:05.540]   And I fear a lot of times that passion is over-discussed.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.640]   It was once under-discussed, I think,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.020]   but now I think it's over-discussed.
[00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.700]   But it really does matter, right?
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.220]   Connect with the things that you're really enthusiastic
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.700]   about, and then an important lesson is,
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.180]   do whatever you're doing with passion.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.500]   Do it heartily, do it with passion.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.060]   If you can't be passionate about a subject,
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:26.020]   at least you can be passionate about the way that you do
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.900]   whatever it is that you are doing.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.400]   Learning to fail.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.540]   I feel like I'd just be repetitive if I go deeply into this,
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.920]   but one of the fundamental components is just to learn
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:41.140]   that failure is an important part of life.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.340]   The guy who can fail the most in life
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.300]   is generally gonna go the farthest,
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.380]   because those lessons learned in failure
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.500]   are in many ways more important
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.300]   than the lessons learned in success.
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.660]   And so learning to fail is super, super important.
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.940]   Now, this list is not all-inclusive.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:03.780]   There are so many other topics that I could list and discuss,
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.820]   but I don't wanna take the time to do that.
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.960]   I wanna encourage you to consider
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.360]   what are those fundamental attributes
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.760]   that you consider to be non-negotiable,
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:17.520]   and for you to consider how you can build
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.120]   those useful beliefs into your children
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.760]   from the earliest of ages,
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:27.760]   and how you can help them to practice these things.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.440]   In a future episode in this,
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.880]   I'll talk about how I believe that virtually
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.360]   all of these virtues and character traits are skills,
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.700]   and the distinction of how a skill
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.620]   means it's something that can be acquired,
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.340]   and it's something that can be developed.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:46.060]   These are not innate, fundamental, unacquired traits.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.500]   They are skills that can be developed,
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.900]   but I wanna deal with that in a second,
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.200]   in a different episode.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.960]   What I wanna finish this episode with
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.260]   is back to this metaphor of the operating system.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.700]   If at all possible,
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:04.580]   I believe that you want to take these skills of success,
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:09.500]   and you want to teach them to your children
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:13.560]   with the greatest possible level of conviction.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.520]   You certainly want to model these skills.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.700]   You want them to see you,
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.180]   but you want to articulate them,
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:21.700]   and you want to articulate them precisely
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.100]   so that your children can understand them
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.740]   at the earliest age possible.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.140]   I wanna take a moment to,
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:35.100]   for a focused excursus on my own journey,
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:39.460]   and how over time I came to believe more strongly
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:44.460]   and deeply in my successful life
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:50.260]   as I developed a more coherent philosophical identity.
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.100]   When I was younger,
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:57.100]   I was exposed to Christian theological teaching,
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:02.180]   and I was exposed to success,
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.420]   kind of success teaching.
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.860]   I exposed myself to these things intentionally.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.080]   And for a long time,
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.860]   there was no connection between these two fields.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.300]   And yeah, a lot of the success gurus
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.540]   would kind of wave their hand at God
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.720]   and a higher power and other stuff,
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.380]   but I didn't really have any conviction about those things.
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:25.060]   And so I absorbed the success gurus' teachings,
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.340]   and I had my biblical understanding,
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:31.140]   but they weren't really strongly connected.
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.220]   But over time,
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:35.060]   I came to see them much more strongly connected
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.500]   in a way that has brought me huge amounts
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:38.940]   of confidence in my life.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.780]   And let me give you a glimpse of that,
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:43.540]   because this is what I do teach my children,
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.900]   what I intend to teach my children,
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.140]   and I believe that it's fundamentally powerful
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.340]   if somebody believes these things, as I do,
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:54.420]   and it brings together life
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:57.180]   and this kind of success skills
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:59.960]   in a coherent and real way.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.180]   When I was in my early to mid-20s, early 20s, I guess,
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.660]   I started reading the Bible a lot.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.180]   And I'd grown up around Christianity,
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:10.460]   but I hadn't read the Bible a lot.
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:12.300]   And so I really just,
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.300]   I started reading the Bible again and again
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:15.660]   and again and again.
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:16.480]   And along the way,
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.600]   that process of just reading the Bible
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.540]   completely transformed several significant aspects
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:26.500]   of my understanding of the world and of my theology.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:30.580]   A major change that happened to me
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.820]   had to do with having a deeper appreciation
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.000]   of the sovereignty of God.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.980]   Sovereignty is a word that means the control,
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.540]   the power, the authority of God.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:42.380]   When I was a boy,
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.980]   I didn't think much of God controlling the world
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.340]   and manipulating the affairs of the world.
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:51.380]   I kind of, I was very focused on the freedom of man.
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:55.780]   There's this classic debate in theological circles
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.620]   between the sovereignty of God and the free will of man.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.140]   It's a debate across all levels of all philosophies,
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:02.700]   et cetera, the sovereignty of God
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:04.540]   versus the free will of man.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.500]   And I just didn't think much about the sovereignty of God.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.060]   But when I read my Bible a bunch of times,
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.540]   all of a sudden I came to this deep, strong conviction
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.220]   that God is ordering the universe.
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.300]   God is controlling the affairs of the universe
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.380]   in a very strong and powerful way.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.020]   And this increased my faith.
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:23.460]   And it caused me to start to see myself
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:28.100]   and to see how these things work together
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:31.260]   and to believe that God was involved in my life.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.820]   He was ordering all of the affairs around me.
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.180]   And this is an incredibly powerful thing.
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:40.140]   If you believe, as I do, in a personal, omnipotent,
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.340]   omniscient, omnipresent God,
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.420]   meaning God who is all powerful, all knowing,
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:49.260]   and is in all places, and he is personal,
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:54.140]   he cares about my life, and he orders the steps of my life,
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:56.500]   it brings this profound sense of relief
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.980]   'cause I don't have to do it all anymore.
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:59.220]   I don't have to figure it out.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.620]   God is conspiring for my good.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:06.340]   And when I matched that over, for example,
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:09.500]   Brian Tracy was one of my early success guru mentors
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.380]   that I really appreciated 'cause he was just so clear.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.580]   And he would say things like,
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.260]   "Believe that the world is conspiring for your good.
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:17.740]   "Believe that everything is for your good," et cetera.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.180]   But I didn't have an anchoring, a grounding for that.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.180]   I believed, okay, that's a useful mental model.
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.660]   That's appropriate.
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.540]   But I didn't believe it at a deep level.
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:27.820]   It was more of, okay, I could see,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.340]   I could turn that on or off.
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.900]   But as I grew to believe it at a deep level,
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:34.860]   it brought a completely different experience of life to me,
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.980]   an experience of faith, of conviction,
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.660]   that God is ordering the steps of my life.
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:42.260]   God is arranging things for my good.
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.660]   And then what's so powerful about this
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.660]   is that this works in Christian theology
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.820]   regardless of what the outcome is.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.220]   In the Bible, there's clear examples
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.460]   of how when we trust God and we follow God and we obey Him,
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.980]   there are times in which that leads
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:02.060]   to what we call blessings, meaning positive feedback,
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:05.540]   things that make us feel like we are doing well.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.460]   We may have riches, we may have joy,
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.060]   we may have, or happiness even.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:12.900]   We may have just this experience where we say,
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.020]   "God is really blessing me.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.660]   "Man, my business is going well," et cetera.
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:19.860]   On the other hand, Christians are frequently admonished
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:23.820]   that don't judge what is happening in your life
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:27.140]   based upon the perspective of external blessings.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:29.180]   So I may be going through tremendous trials,
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:32.020]   tremendous difficulties, my business may be failing,
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.180]   and I still bless God in the middle of it.
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:35.340]   And this is what's so powerful
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.840]   about Christianity specifically,
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:42.060]   is that the external evidence, quote-unquote,
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.220]   for success or failure is not the arbiter,
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:48.220]   the real arbiter of success and failure.
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:51.900]   After all, Jesus Christ Himself ended His life,
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:54.460]   or His life was ended, His life was ended
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:58.500]   when He was completely impoverished, had nothing,
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:02.040]   died in what seemed to be the world's greatest failure,
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.240]   and yet, and all of His disciples betrayed Him
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.660]   and forsook Him at the last time, at the last moment.
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:12.020]   And yet, from that depth of despair,
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:16.060]   from that seemingly quite inauspicious beginning,
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.320]   the world has been utterly transformed
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.980]   over the past 2,000 years.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:24.480]   And so you can't judge from external evidence.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.220]   So, and again, in Scripture itself,
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.180]   Scriptures are commanded, right?
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.300]   Paul says, "I've learned to abound,
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.780]   "and I've learned to be abased," right?
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.900]   "I've learned to be in want,
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.160]   "and I've learned to be in plenty,
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:38.040]   "and I will bless God in the middle of both of those things."
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.440]   So this is what's so powerful,
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:43.420]   is what does God want from me in these circumstances?
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.020]   Well, He wants faithfulness, He wants a faithful heart,
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:49.140]   and what matters is not the outcome.
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:52.540]   What matters is how I go through the circumstances.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.340]   What matters is what I do.
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:58.260]   And what is so powerful about religious conviction
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:01.420]   and religious belief is that you have hope,
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:06.380]   and that hope is not dependent upon current circumstances.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.860]   That hope is for this life,
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:11.780]   but it is also for that next life.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.800]   And so in the halls of heroes,
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.040]   we look back in Christian tradition,
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.760]   and we see that many people's hopes
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.360]   were never rewarded in this life.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:24.840]   Many faithful men and women have been sawn in two,
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.680]   many have been put up as torches,
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.360]   many have been impoverished and starved to death,
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:35.360]   and yet their reward, their success is guaranteed,
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.240]   because that success comes in heaven.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.520]   That success comes in the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.560]   That success comes in the next life.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:47.400]   And this life and how we proceed through this life
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.320]   is preparation for the next life.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:54.000]   And what matters is not the specific outcome,
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.200]   but what matters is what we do.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:59.200]   Over time, I came to what I think
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.540]   is a more mature understanding of this interplay
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:06.640]   between my responsibility and God's divine ordering.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:10.080]   Currently, my current understanding of scripture
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:12.680]   is on this issue is what I would align
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.960]   with what is called Molinism.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.080]   It's not Calvinism, it's not Arminianism, it's Molinism.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.360]   And Molinius Calvin, of course,
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.680]   if you're, I shouldn't say of course,
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:23.640]   for the uninitiated, John Calvin
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.880]   is a famous Protestant theologian,
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.080]   and he was a French theologian,
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.440]   and he preached and lived in Geneva.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:36.240]   And he developed these very strong persuasive arguments
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.200]   that have led to many people who identify themselves
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.160]   under the doctrine of what is called Calvinism.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:46.800]   And Calvinism has a variety of distinctive features,
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:51.380]   but if we had to wrap it all up in one feature,
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:53.860]   I would say it's that God controls everything.
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.760]   God does everything, God controls everything.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.460]   And there's different expressions of that
[00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:59.800]   in terms of how that gets applied.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:04.600]   Now, there was another of his contemporaries
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.720]   named Arminius, what was his first name?
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.120]   Jacob Arminius, I think.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.120]   And so Arminianism is a doctrine in Protestant Christianity
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:20.680]   that basically says, well, God does not do everything,
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.160]   but it's human beings that do everything.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:27.960]   And human beings are the ones who are responsible to obey
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.360]   and who are responsible to do things
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.520]   and are responsible to respond, et cetera.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.360]   And so there's this classic arguments between these things,
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.680]   and it's across all of, again,
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.160]   Christianity and philosophy broadly.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.440]   Now, separately, there's a third guy
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.520]   who wound up weighing in on some of these battles,
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.040]   and he was not a Protestant theologian,
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.680]   but rather a Roman Catholic theologian
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.360]   named Louis de Molina.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.360]   And he developed the ideas of what today
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.040]   are referred to as Molinism.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.640]   And what I consider myself so powerful
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.160]   about the teachings of, or the idea,
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.440]   the philosophy of Molinism
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.040]   is that it unites these two forces
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.000]   in a really powerful way.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   And here's what Molina, what he taught, what Molinism is.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.080]   Molinism is, it says that God has
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.960]   basically three forms of knowledge.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.680]   So the first form of knowledge
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:29.680]   is that of necessary truths or natural knowledge.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.080]   This kind of knowledge is truth
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:37.080]   that is independent of God's will and is non-contingent.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.320]   So this is knowledge of facts.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.160]   The classic example is that all bachelors are unmarried.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.600]   The fact that all bachelors are unmarried
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.840]   is not a fact that's based upon God's will.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.720]   It is simply a non-contingent statement.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.960]   The second kind of knowledge that God has
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.840]   is that of what is called middle knowledge.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:02.800]   And this kind of knowledge is that God knows all things
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.560]   that would happen in any infinite number
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.160]   of choices or decisions.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.480]   So God knows what would happen
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.720]   if I leave my house at nine o'clock to drive to work.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.360]   And God knows what would happen
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.400]   if I were to leave my house at 9.10 and drive to work.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.560]   All of these, this kinds of knowledge
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.560]   is part of God's knowledge.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.080]   And then the third kind of knowledge
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.880]   is God's free knowledge.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.660]   And this knowledge is knowledge that consists
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:35.160]   of contingent truths that are dependent upon God's will,
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.600]   the things that he brings about, the things that he does.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.660]   And in this third knowledge, this free knowledge,
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:46.640]   we have God specifically controlling the events of mankind.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.180]   So the classic example here is God created the world.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:52.920]   He caused the world to come into being.
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.400]   And he was the causal agent in that.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.320]   So here would be an example of why this is so satisfying,
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.200]   at least to me, and perhaps to you also.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:06.200]   Think about a specific, think about an example like this.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.100]   Jesus Christ, when he was crucified
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.000]   by the Roman government, Pontius Pilate,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   did God cause Pontius Pilate to condemn Jesus Christ
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.380]   to death?
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:22.380]   If you read about the trial proceedings of Christ,
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.100]   here was an innocent man who was completely innocent
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.420]   of the crimes of which he was accused.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.220]   Pilate said he was innocent,
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.780]   and Pilate had the opportunity to free him.
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:36.700]   So did God cause Pilate to free Christ?
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.460]   Was God a causal agent in that?
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:44.460]   Or was Pilate free to not condemn Jesus Christ to death?
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.020]   'Cause Pilate had full control.
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.100]   Pilate could have said, "No, we're gonna set him free."
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.780]   And under the law at that time,
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:55.800]   the Jews would not have been able to crucify Christ,
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.580]   because it was Pilate's, it was his authority.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:03.060]   So then would God's plan have been foiled?
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.220]   Because it was predicted from the beginning of mankind,
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:10.100]   from centuries, we have hundreds and hundreds of predictions
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.180]   about the life of Christ from centuries earlier.
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.460]   And so how would these things have come true
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.100]   if Jesus Christ had not fulfilled them?
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.140]   We know that Christ himself was in a very self-aware manner,
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:24.260]   specifically fulfilling the predictions made about him.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.180]   And the ultimate prediction was that he was going to die
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.180]   and be raised.
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:30.540]   So how does this work?
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.460]   Well, I find it very satisfying
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:36.100]   to consider this concept of middle knowledge.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.100]   And basically, I would defend this idea,
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:44.100]   that God knows all of the potential outcomes
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:48.100]   of any particular set of decisions,
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.420]   of what a man would do
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.700]   in any particular set of circumstances.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:57.900]   So God knew that a man named Pontius Pilate,
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.260]   if he were put in this situation,
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:04.060]   he would freely choose of his own will
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.460]   to condemn Jesus Christ to death.
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.780]   Therefore God's will that his son would die
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.500]   would be brought to fruition.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:16.820]   Would be brought to fruition through the free choices
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:19.700]   of all of the men involved.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.140]   Now, let's bring it out of the theological
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:25.580]   and bring it back to my life, into my children's life.
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:30.180]   What this means is that God has divinely conspired
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:34.780]   to create and order all of the circumstances of my life
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:38.580]   so that I, of my own free choice and free action,
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:42.020]   will fulfill his will for my life.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:47.260]   That leaves me fully responsible
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.820]   and yet God fully in control,
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.980]   which is the most incredibly freeing
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:54.300]   psychological place to be.
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:58.860]   I know that God is divinely conspiring for my success.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:02.900]   And what I have to do is I have to do the work.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.500]   I have to be faithful.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.780]   I know what God's will is ultimately,
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:12.300]   but I also know that God has chosen to bring about his will
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.260]   through my active participation.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.380]   And whether you apply that at the level
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:18.940]   of an individual life,
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:21.220]   or you apply that at the level of a family,
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.860]   or you apply that at the level of a community
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.580]   or of a nation, it's the most powerful thing
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.980]   that you could imagine if you actually believe it,
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.660]   if you genuinely believe it.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:36.020]   It's one of the most incredible success programs
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:38.460]   that you could install into a human being.
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:43.020]   And it lends itself to a strong emotional stability.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:46.180]   We'll talk about emotional stability in the next episode.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:48.460]   Here I always think of the Greek Stoics
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:50.940]   and the Stoic philosophy that's very extreme,
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.340]   become quite popular today,
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:56.380]   even among in the success circles.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.460]   But I don't ascribe myself to Stoic philosophy,
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:03.260]   but I pull out basically the same foundation
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.540]   in Christianity.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:07.860]   The idea of Stoicism is accept what comes
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.860]   and focus on how you act through it.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.900]   And so in Christian theology, here's a trial.
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:17.060]   Book of James says, "Praise God for the trial.
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:18.960]   "Thank you, God, for this trial.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.040]   "I'm grateful for it.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.160]   "I know that it's come to do a good work in my life.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.520]   "I'm glad that it's here.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.820]   "Now what matters is how do I respond through it?
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:31.020]   "What do I do in the face of this trial?"
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.860]   Or a blessing, right?
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.020]   A wonderful something to be excited about.
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:36.500]   Thank you, God, for this blessing.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.940]   Now what matters is what do I do?
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.020]   How do I behave?
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.460]   How do I act in the middle of this?
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.980]   And so I know that's a fairly
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.620]   theologically involved argument,
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.900]   but I wanna make this practical and show you how
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.700]   if we can connect these success principles
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.820]   at a very deep level, at a philosophical level,
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.900]   at a deep theological level of conviction,
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.860]   then they become so much more powerful.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.900]   And so let's be faithful to identify these things
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.820]   and identify the things that are useful
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.540]   and then help our children to understand them
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.940]   intellectually, to identify and be very clear
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:15.020]   on the impact of these things,
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.520]   and then to practice them continually throughout their life
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:22.340]   because virtues and character is practiced.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.820]   It's a skill that needs to be developed
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.300]   and it's developed in the beginning in a small way.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.500]   It's developed in adolescence and in young adulthood
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:33.180]   in a stronger way, and then ideally it flourishes
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.700]   and blooms as our children come into adulthood.
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.940]   As I wind down this theme,
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:42.020]   I wanna mention a few practical considerations.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:45.620]   I wish I had a longer list,
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.940]   but I do have some things that I'm,
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:51.580]   at least I have noticed that I try to encourage
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.940]   and focus on.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:57.300]   With each of these success features or success attributes,
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.100]   I think we can take them and then think about
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.060]   the process of child training and ask,
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.380]   how do we incorporate them?
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:07.460]   So let me begin with the one that I mentioned,
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:09.300]   learning to fail, okay?
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.300]   Failure, what does failure mean?
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:15.860]   Well, I think there's something fundamentally at odds
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:19.620]   with how we teach in the school system,
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.900]   with the way that we inculcate the idea that failure is bad.
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:28.380]   And you see this a lot if you look at many thinkers
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.340]   in the modern space.
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:32.460]   For example, Peter Diamandis is someone I've followed
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.420]   for years, and he talks a lot about this,
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:39.620]   and he has a white minor paper that he wrote on education.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.860]   This was a big point of his
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:42.700]   that I thought was really well taken,
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:47.420]   where he talks about the importance of that we know
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.780]   that successful business owners and really anybody
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.140]   understands that failure is a fundamental part.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.660]   Failure is not to be avoided, failure is to be embraced.
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:57.580]   It's how we learn.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:00.860]   We could see this when we watch our children learn to walk.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:01.700]   What do they do?
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.020]   Well, they fall down.
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:06.340]   They start with little steps, they stand up, they fall down.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.460]   They stand up, they fall down.
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.460]   They stand up, they fall down.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:09.980]   Eventually, they take a step and they fall down.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:11.820]   They take a step and they fall down, et cetera.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:15.180]   And eventually, after falling down lots of times,
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.500]   they learn how to walk.
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.620]   And you can see this at a later stage.
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.100]   If you go to your local skate park
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:24.940]   and you watch a skater learning a trick on a skateboard,
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:27.980]   oh, he'll fail and fail and fail and fail and fail.
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.260]   And eventually, he'll sort of kind of start to get it
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.020]   and then he'll fail and fail and fail and he'll continue on.
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.380]   Well, we understand that it's most basic level
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:38.220]   that this failure is a necessary part of the system.
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:42.020]   But then we build this fear of failure into children
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.220]   with the way that we grade them,
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:45.260]   the way that we do testing, et cetera.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:47.660]   And we say that somehow if you fail a test,
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.580]   then that's gonna wreck you for the rest of time.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.540]   Or if you fail school,
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.500]   it's gonna wreck you for the rest of time.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.380]   And some people come out of this,
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:56.260]   but how many more people would come out of this
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.580]   if we change the system in some way?
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:01.020]   So my practical application of this
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:06.020]   is to eliminate testing as a methodology
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:11.500]   that has any kind of emotional impact.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.140]   The reason I'm struggling a little for the words
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:19.140]   is I used to say that I was completely opposed to testing
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:20.980]   in an individualized setting, right?
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.340]   'Cause testing is primarily necessary
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:26.020]   as a form of communication between a teacher
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:29.520]   and his students if he's not able to identify
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.940]   where the students are at.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.100]   So that's a fundamental problem.
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.020]   A teacher should know where each student is at.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.060]   And it's only in an industrial setting
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.380]   where the teacher has too many students
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.500]   that he needs to assign a test
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.540]   of here's how much the student understands.
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.500]   And then the testing and the grade system
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.340]   is a form of communication between a parent and a teacher
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.860]   who don't have other good forms of communication.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.660]   So these are not fundamentally important
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.800]   to the learning of the child
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.740]   or to the educational model of the child.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:57.520]   Now, so I used to be completely opposed to testing.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:01.740]   Then I started digging into some of the ways to learn,
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.620]   neuroscience ideas on ways to learn.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.260]   And I become convinced that testing
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:08.940]   is actually an important mode of learning,
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.340]   an important way to learning.
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:14.180]   One way that people who are skilled at learning do
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.660]   is they just sit down and test themselves.
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.900]   A very popular method is called free recall.
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.100]   You sit down, you read something,
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.940]   and then you close your book or you turn off the lecture,
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.500]   and then you pull out a piece of paper
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.020]   and you write down everything that you remember.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:26.860]   It's a test.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.740]   And the actual testing process causes your brain
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:34.100]   to pay attention to what you know
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.540]   and to know it at a deeper level.
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:38.100]   So I have changed myself,
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:42.740]   my previous dismissiveness of testing.
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:46.020]   And I'm mostly focused on how can we incorporate testing
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.580]   as a method of learning
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:51.100]   rather than as a method of judgment, so to speak,
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.400]   or a method of stratification of students, et cetera.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.020]   So back to the learning to fail.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:13:00.100]   Let's take out the fear of failure.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.260]   And so, for example, what I do
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.100]   when I test my children in our homeschool
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.140]   is we do a modified form of free recall.
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.260]   We do narration.
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.220]   So I say, "Tell me everything that you know
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.980]   about President Grant."
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:18.020]   We're doing basically around Civil War time right now.
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:21.340]   "Tell me everything you know about Theodore Roosevelt."
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:24.500]   And the focus is on what you know,
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.740]   not on what you don't know.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.360]   The focus is on having a chance to talk about
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.640]   all the things that you can say about a person
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.200]   rather than getting certain questions wrong
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.460]   because I couldn't figure out how to do the question.
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.780]   And so I see this as a healthy thing.
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.720]   And then in terms of failure,
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.020]   I think it's very important that we articulate,
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.620]   anytime there is failure, we articulate it
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:48.180]   from the perspective of what are the lessons.
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.300]   So you decided to start a business idea
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.940]   and you were gonna sell bread.
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:55.300]   Okay, well, what did people buy and what didn't people buy?
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.200]   Or you decided you were gonna go and try this new activity
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.060]   and you fail, what did you learn?
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:03.620]   We need to take away the emotional stigma from failure
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.300]   in every way, and we need to encourage failure
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.780]   as a learning process.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.000]   And that's something that we as parents can facilitate.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.680]   And I think we can do a much better job of that
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.400]   and the educational model of our children.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.280]   It'd be, think about this,
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   if you had the chance to hire somebody to work for you
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.480]   and you had the choice of two candidates,
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.480]   candidate A went and performed brilliantly
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.160]   in one specific field.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.040]   Let's say that, it doesn't matter,
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.420]   I don't need to give more specificity.
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:42.700]   Candidate A performed brilliantly in one specific field,
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.420]   got straight 100s on all of the exams,
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.300]   did beautifully well on one field,
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:53.860]   but that candidate chose not to pursue other fields
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:57.820]   or to study other classes because that candidate
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.900]   didn't wanna mess up his GPA.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.340]   And candidate two, on the other hand, comes in
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:07.280]   and candidate two got Bs in field A
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.700]   instead of straight As like candidate A had.
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:15.160]   So candidate B got Bs, but candidate B went to some classes
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.080]   in this subject and in that subject, et cetera,
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:23.080]   and he got a D on his classes in French history,
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.960]   but he really enjoyed them.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.080]   He just didn't do very well, but he really enjoyed
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.240]   and he went to that and then he went
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:32.420]   into some welding classes and he got mediocre marks there
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:34.820]   and he completely failed out of art class
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.420]   because he was a terrible artist,
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:38.460]   but he loved looking at pictures.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:41.060]   Which of those candidates is more attractive to you?
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:47.180]   The broader level of experience is what we want.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:51.320]   It's not the grade that counts, it's the experience.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.820]   Again, I think the best example is we think about
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.740]   how famously Steve Jobs' calligraphy class
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:16:00.420]   that he took informed his aesthetic sensibilities
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:02.060]   for the rest of his life.
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.580]   He didn't need the calligraphy class for a GPA,
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:07.540]   he just went and took it, but yet it taught him something.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:08.980]   And so this is how I view learning.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:12.500]   It's better to have 20% knowledge of something
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.460]   and have that than 0% because you didn't wanna
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.140]   not get a perfect grade.
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.040]   Remember when I spoke to you about language learning?
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.740]   Language learning is one of those cool things
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:25.140]   where just a little bit of knowledge is better than nothing.
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:28.820]   If you have 100 words in a foreign language,
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.940]   you're way better off than if you had zero words.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:33.620]   Now, of course, you'll be better when you have 500 words,
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.220]   but the 100 words counts.
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:39.460]   And so we shouldn't, our systems should not be structured
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:43.500]   upon kind of pulling back, but rather on building up.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.860]   There's another way we could focus on the same concept
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:50.100]   has to do with do we start at 100 and get marks wrong,
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:53.940]   100%, or do we start at zero and build up?
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:56.820]   And so any way we can figure out how in our children's lives
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.980]   to focus on the fact that we're starting from zero
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:03.980]   and building up, I think is a more powerful move.
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:06.540]   If you think of a video game, a video game,
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:09.500]   the gamer goes through it and the gamer fails a level,
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.540]   but that doesn't mean that the gamer gets detracted
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:16.380]   from 100%, it just means that the gamer failed that level.
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:18.740]   So the gamer goes back and does the level again
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:21.060]   and does the level again and eventually passes the level.
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:24.180]   And it doesn't matter how many times
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:26.380]   the gamer approaches the level,
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:30.500]   what matters is how the,
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.140]   that is that they eventually pass it.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.580]   And so in all learning endeavors,
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:38.140]   I think this is a more useful principle
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:41.340]   that we should incorporate into the approach.
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:45.340]   It doesn't matter how many times you fail a level,
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.900]   what matters is that eventually you pass the level
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.660]   and that you keep going through.
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:53.340]   This is a core component of learning to fail.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:56.260]   This is a core component of that growth mindset.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:18:00.100]   This is a core component of developing persistence and grit
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.340]   so that we press through.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.580]   Another practical technique that we can use
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:09.580]   is to praise those attributes, those character qualities
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:12.500]   that we want to see grow and do it in a way
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:15.340]   that continues to lead to growth.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:17.500]   I think, I forget where to, I read this somewhere,
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.980]   it could have been Dweck's book, I'm not sure,
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:19.980]   I haven't read that book in years,
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:24.980]   but there's a big difference between praising a child
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:29.620]   for being smart versus praising a child
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:33.540]   for working really hard and developing his intelligence
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.180]   or expressing his intelligence, et cetera.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:39.140]   If you praise a child for being smart,
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:42.020]   then that can cause the child to say,
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.820]   well, yes, I'm smart, which may be a good thing,
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:49.260]   but to see then that any evidence that indicates
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:50.740]   that somehow he might not be smart
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:52.860]   'cause he got a question wrong on the test
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.500]   or wasn't at the top score, et cetera,
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.940]   to harm his self-image.
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:00.340]   On the other hand, if you praise a child for his hard work,
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:03.260]   all the child needs to do to achieve that level of success
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:07.340]   is work hard, and that's an internal metric.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.660]   So I know I worked hard, I'm satisfied.
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:11.740]   Doesn't matter whether I'm number one in the class
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:14.540]   or number 10, what matters is that I did the best
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.820]   that I could, that I worked really hard.
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:19.480]   Now, the other side is I think it's also useful
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:23.220]   to praise those attributes that are fundamental.
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:26.740]   I have an example that I'm personally passionate about
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:31.740]   is I think that girls should be repeatedly affirmed
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:37.060]   in their physical beauty without trying to go
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:42.200]   to an external metric of what is it that defines beauty.
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:46.780]   There may be an external standard of symmetry
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:49.020]   being the perfect definition of beauty,
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.680]   but at its core, one of the things I've noticed
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.020]   over the years is quite simply that it's very hard
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:20:00.020]   to find a girl who is not beautiful in any way,
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:04.980]   and what makes a huge difference in the beauty of a woman
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:09.980]   is her level of confidence in herself and in who she is.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.040]   I want to praise continually the beauty
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.360]   that comes from within, character qualities,
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.760]   empathy, kindness, compassion, all of the virtues
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.400]   that a woman can embody, but at its core,
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:25.200]   a woman who is confident, who is confident in who she is,
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.540]   who's been told all her life by her father
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:32.460]   that she is beautiful, she becomes beautiful
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.880]   as a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.920]   because she is a human creature, she is a woman,
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.300]   and if she's not told that she's beautiful,
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.760]   then she may doubt her beauty,
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.080]   and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.280]   where am I beautiful enough, et cetera.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:51.500]   And so that's just something I personally care a lot about,
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:55.080]   but there are many other attributes as well.
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:58.680]   And so the role, and I gotta cut off here
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.660]   'cause I don't wanna steal my thunder from the next episode,
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:05.660]   but recognize that there is always the virtues
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:11.520]   that a person has are always present in some quality.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.160]   None of us would go to another human being and say,
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.040]   there is nothing beautiful about you.
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.960]   You take the most disfigured human being,
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.120]   somebody who's been horrifically burned,
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.280]   horrifically scarred, et cetera,
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.440]   and by all objective metrics,
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.660]   that person is ugly as anything.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.360]   And yet even in that, you'll look and behold that person
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:40.600]   and based upon the inward beauty of character,
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:45.480]   or even just the fact that this is a living soul,
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:50.400]   someone who has endured incredible adversity and pain,
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.840]   that is a beautiful person.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:59.520]   And so virtually all of these things,
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.380]   they're not objectively true or not.
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:07.120]   The things that make a person ugly
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:11.200]   are all virtues or characters.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.760]   A person can be incredibly handsome,
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:16.520]   and yet if he's crass, right,
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:19.480]   or if she's really just obnoxious
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:21.320]   and dismissive of other people's
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.720]   and cuts people down, et cetera,
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.880]   no matter the level of physical beauty,
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.660]   that's an ugly person
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:31.840]   because the ugliness is expressed from within
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.360]   and no one wants to be around someone like that.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.320]   And so my point is to say that
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.800]   don't think that these things are,
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.640]   that you either are or aren't.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.840]   Life doesn't work that way.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:46.360]   We all are in a measure,
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.660]   but I'm getting ahead of myself.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.880]   I'm gonna cut myself off there,
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:52.440]   pick that up in a future episode.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:55.640]   Recognize that as you think about cultivating
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:58.320]   and investing into the spirit of your child,
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:03.100]   one component of which you want to pay careful attention
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:06.820]   is to instill in your children
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:11.820]   an ideology, a philosophy of success.
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:18.580]   There are certain philosophies, ideas that are useful
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:22.540]   and that are much more likely to lead to your child
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:27.220]   being confident and successful in life.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:32.220]   And if you can successfully install those ideologies,
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:37.180]   the child will see them and take them on as his own
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:38.780]   in the fullness of time.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.020]   On the other hand,
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.660]   though you do everything else we've talked about,
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:45.740]   if you surround that child with ideologies
[01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:47.580]   that lead to failure,
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.500]   that can be enough to harm
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:53.280]   the future prospects of your children.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.300]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.780]   I hope that these thoughts have been useful to you
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:59.980]   and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.
