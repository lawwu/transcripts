[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.600]   the third time we've spoken on this podcast.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.320]   He is the wise turtle, master oogway to my Kung Fu Panda,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.160]   one of my favorite people to talk to in this world.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.480]   A complicated and fascinating mind
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.920]   that I'm grateful to have the chance to accompany
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.560]   in exploring this world through conversation
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.560]   on this podcast and on his, the latter called "The Portal."
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.240]   Quick mention of each sponsor,
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.240]   followed by some thoughts related to the episode.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.200]   First is Grammarly, a service I use in my writing
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.720]   to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.160]   and readability.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.320]   Second is Sun Basket, a meal delivery service I use
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.520]   to add healthy variety into my culinary life.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.760]   Third is SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.400]   I've ever come across.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.640]   I don't like looking at numbers, but somebody should.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.840]   It helps you make good decisions.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.160]   And finally, ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.640]   to protect my privacy on the internet.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.920]   Please check out these sponsors in the description
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.640]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.800]   As a side note, let me say that wherever this life takes me,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.880]   I'm drawn to the possibility of having many more
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.240]   conversations with Eric through the years.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.080]   I think we have just the right kind
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.200]   of contrasting worldviews and a deep respect
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.000]   and appreciation of each other's life stories
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.800]   that creates for this magical experience
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.640]   in the realm of conversation that feels like
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.440]   we're always looking for something
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.600]   that we never quite find,
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.840]   but are always better for having tried.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.440]   I'm not sure how or why the universe has connected Eric
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.520]   and me, but it did.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.240]   And I would be a fool not to trust his judgment
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.560]   and enjoy the journey.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.440]   If somehow you like this podcast,

[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.320]   And now here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.520]   Who's the greatest musician of all time, would you say?
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.920]   - We were just off camera talking about Eddie Van Halen.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.120]   He unfortunately passed away.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.080]   - Who's the greatest musician of all time?
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.400]   - Yeah.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.880]   - Jonathan Richman.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.560]   - Who's that?
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560]   - It's a weird question,
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.720]   so I'm gonna give you a weird answer.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.680]   It's not because-- - Thank you.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.120]   - Okay, Jonathan Richman, the reason I'm picking on him
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.920]   is that he had a quote.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.540]   He was the front man of a group called the Modern Lovers.
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.440]   And his quote was something like,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.560]   "We have to be prepared to play music.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.480]   When our instruments are broken,
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.240]   the electricity's out and it's raining,"
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.240]   something like that.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.880]   And I thought that that quote was very interesting
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.440]   because what it said was,
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.640]   "You have to be able to strip this thing down
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.800]   farther and farther back
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.120]   to get to something that is intrinsically musical."
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.720]   So we were having a conversation just now about virtuosity.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.000]   We're talking about Eddie Van Halen and his recent passing.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.680]   And that affected me emotionally.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.600]   I don't know whether it affected you.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.640]   I was never a Van Halen, the group fan,
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   but I revered Eddie Van Halen's capacity for innovation.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.600]   I saw him like Rodney Mullin, the skateboarder.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.400]   I had dreamed of having the two of them on the same podcast
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.840]   just to talk about what it's like
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.760]   to totally discontinuously innovate.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.400]   - And you posted a video of Spanish Fly, I think,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.000]   and saying, "I didn't know the guitar
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.160]   could make those kinds of sounds.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.360]   Like, what is this voodoo magic?"
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.560]   - What is it?
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.480]   Well, this is the thing, right?
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.640]   The arpeggios that he did on a single string are so fast,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.000]   and the attacks from the hammer-ons,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.560]   when they go at light speed, as he did,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.080]   particularly, and the reason I chose that
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.320]   was that I wanted to strip out the electronics,
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.680]   because part of the claim will be
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.000]   is that he's a rock musician,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.960]   and a lot of the innovations had to do with things
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.160]   peculiar to sort of the electrified setup.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.840]   You know, his use of the whammy bar, for example,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.120]   or the Frankenstrat that he built from different pieces.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.720]   All of those aspects, in my opinion,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.760]   are just dwarfed by his innovation and his musicianship,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.640]   and that's why I chose Spanish Fly,
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.680]   because everyone, of course,
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.160]   will go to something like "Eruption"
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.080]   or "Running with the Devil,"
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.920]   which is the first things that they heard
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.560]   that let them know that there was a new force
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.320]   erupting out of Southern California
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   that was Eddie Van Halen.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.680]   I'm in love with the story of it.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.360]   - You're often so poetic about music.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.960]   Like, it clearly touches your soul
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.000]   on some kind of, on many levels.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.520]   What is that?
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.840]   Is it deeper than just rocking out
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.120]   with the, in your convertible Corvette '69?
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.640]   I imagine Eric Weinstein's just driving down
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.480]   the California highways, blasting some kind of music.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.040]   Is it just like being able to be carefree
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.240]   for moments of time,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.380]   or is there something more fundamental
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.000]   that connects the theory of everything,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.760]   and physics, and life, and all of that?
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.980]   - How often do you have the chance, for example,
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.560]   to hear mathematics performed, as you do in Bach?
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.880]   Right, like something with that kind of precision
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.560]   and elegance that can't really be grasped,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.560]   where, you know, to go back to Leonard Cohen's famous line,
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.480]   the baffled king composing, right?
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.320]   - That's such a good song.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.240]   - It's such a good song, but it's also like,
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.140]   individual verses of that song are insanely important.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.360]   The baffled king is how we often make music.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.640]   We don't really understand what did we just do
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.200]   that broke that person's heart sitting on the couch, right?
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   And so, it's a very strange thing
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.040]   that you should be able to have.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.440]   Think of it like you're a computer.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.840]   You've got this weird open music port,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.680]   you know, port 37.8, you know?
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.080]   Like, it's not even supposed to be there,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.240]   and suddenly somebody starts playing a guitar,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.520]   and they're making you feel things.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.240]   Or, you know, like in particular,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.400]   particular instruments like the violin,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.200]   it's so difficult, it's so unforgiving,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.960]   and when it gives up its secrets,
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.400]   it just, you know, it wraps its fingers around your heart
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.020]   and won't let go.
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.000]   Sometimes I talk about head, heart, and loins.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.600]   When something can grab your head, heart, and your loins
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.660]   at the same moment and integrate them,
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.600]   there are very few opportunities to live like that.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.560]   And if you think about Eddie Van Halen,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.040]   you know, as far as your head, the musical innovations,
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.000]   and the fact that he was drawing directly
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.280]   from the classical canon, you know,
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.640]   really speaks to the idea that maybe rock
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.920]   is what somebody like Jimi Hendrix saw it as being,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.720]   you know, an infinitely extensible medium.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.680]   In terms of heart, I always notice the smile on his face.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.440]   It's painful to look at an Eddie Van Halen solo now.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.960]   Like, sometimes you'll see the cigarette
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.800]   dripping off the side of his mouth,
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.000]   and you're like, that's gonna fucking kill you,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.400]   and I'm not even worried about it for you,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.800]   I'm worried about it for me.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.760]   You're gonna rob, I don't even need to hear you
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.760]   play another note, I just like knowing
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.160]   that you're in the world, that there is somebody
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.080]   that everyone looks to, that nobody,
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.680]   I've never heard a guitarist say, eh, I don't know,
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.880]   I think he was okay.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.360]   Like, I've just never heard it.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.560]   You can hate him, but you still think he was a genius.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.840]   There are very few people like that in the world.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.200]   And then loins, those leaps, that guy was incredibly
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.320]   good looking, you know, skin-tight pants,
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.080]   super athleticism, he completely owned the sexuality,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.760]   the male sexuality of the stage, both being
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.360]   the completely dominant, you know,
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.960]   sort of mythical alpha male, I hate that expression,
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.400]   but there you are, but also this kind
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.480]   of little boy with this mischievous smirk,
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.800]   and you know, the sense that it all came together,
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.080]   how could you not eat that up?
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.960]   - You could just imagine the millions
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.240]   of like young teenage boys who are just like
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.160]   playing air guitar in their room,
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.280]   just, yeah, basically dreaming of being that kind of god,
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.400]   the most perfect example of what a human being can be.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.120]   Yeah, it's fascinating to think.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.640]   - It is, and then, you know, as in many of the cases
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.800]   with these bands, you get these multiple talents
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.680]   in the same outfit, and I think that the original
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.440]   configuration with David Lee Roth,
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.160]   I mean, David Lee Roth is such a hot mess at all times.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.600]   - I would love you to talk to David Lee Roth.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   Like, if the, that dance would be just gorgeous.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.040]   - I don't know.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.720]   - Can you handle, can you ride that?
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.560]   - Probably not.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.400]   - Yeah.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.280]   - Probably not, because I think he's very,
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.240]   I get the feeling that he's very smart
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.320]   and very dysregulated, and I don't know that I could,
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.160]   like--
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.880]   - Like bring him down to earth for a moment.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.320]   - Well, I can also get pretty dysregulated, you know?
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.640]   - And so, I don't know, I don't know whether,
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.680]   it could be magic, it could be a shit show,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.040]   I don't know what you thought of his appearance on "Rogan,"
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.680]   that was an interesting one.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.160]   - I loved it, but Joe, and Joe does this sometimes,
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.760]   sometimes he just sits back and listens,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.600]   and he just lets the music play, which works really well.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.720]   I think you have a chance to kinda jump into the chaos.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.560]   - I care to.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.840]   - And then you'll just start, and the places you'll go,
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.520]   you may not even talk about music for hours.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.400]   It might just go to this, 'cause he, I think,
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.520]   lives in Japan, there's a weird, he's--
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.000]   - He's been in EMT after he was a rock star,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.080]   he chose to be kind of like, I don't know.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.680]   You know, it like--
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.920]   - There's depth to that man
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.000]   that hasn't been explored by him either,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.320]   so that'll be an exciting conversation.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.160]   Can we go back to Leonard Cohen?
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.000]   - Yeah.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.440]   - Can we just, the things I feel when I listen to "Hallelujah"
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.800]   by Leonard Cohen, or anything by him, really,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.680]   but that one--
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.880]   - You really wanna get into it?
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.780]   - Let's go, what does that song mean to you?
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.840]   Is it love?
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.160]   - Oh, boy.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.920]   Well, first of all, it's mystery.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.560]   Like, it starts off about mystery.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.200]   So what are you doing?
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.720]   You're doing this alternation between the two chords,
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.440]   so three notes at the same time,
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   one is called the tonic, or you have the major
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.400]   and the relative minor, and he's alternating between them.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.840]   There's only one note of difference
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.160]   between those two chords.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.720]   One of them would be feeling sad,
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.560]   one of them would be more joyous, typically described.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.480]   And so by altering one note, it's the minimal amount
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.080]   to take you back and forth between joy and happiness
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.840]   as that's encoded in us.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.240]   So he starts off with, I heard there was a scene,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.360]   David played the "Please, Lord,"
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.520]   but you don't really care for music, do ya?
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.760]   That's really interesting,
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.640]   because he's using this technique called bathos, right?
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.280]   So the alternation between the sublime
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.480]   and kind of the guttural or ridiculous or the mundane, right?
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.320]   So he's like--
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.000]   - But there's a bitterness to it, too.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.280]   Is it just play?
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.960]   - Well, the way I hear it, again,
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.960]   great song allows for different interpretations.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.440]   You happen to be asking me, so I'm gonna impart some stuff
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.680]   that probably isn't in the song, but why it speaks to me,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.000]   and that's what makes it great.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.320]   The way I hear it is he doesn't believe the audience.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.760]   You don't really care for music, do ya?
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.240]   Then what are you doing listening to this,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.400]   you stupid idiots, you know?
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.480]   Of course you care for music.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.520]   You're too cool to care, so I see through you and screw you.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.640]   That's the energy I get.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.480]   Then he does this weird thing.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.040]   It goes like this is where he should put the description
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.680]   of where he is in the chord progression,
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.320]   which is the tonic, right?
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.600]   It goes like this, and then he hits the fourth
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.760]   and the fifth, which are the two other major elements,
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.040]   the subdominant and the dominant in functional harmony.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.720]   So he's describing the chord progression
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.080]   in real time in the lyrics.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.240]   There's two ways this can come about in other songs.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.600]   We had this example of every time we say goodbye.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.880]   Do you know this song?
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.640]   ♪ Every time we say goodbye ♪
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.520]   No, I think it was Cole Porter, maybe,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.760]   or Gershwin, maybe Porter, I don't know.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.240]   ♪ I cry a little ♪
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.120]   ♪ There is no love song finer ♪
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.120]   ♪ But how strange the change from major to minor ♪
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.840]   Right, like it's a beautiful use of that.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.400]   Then there's times when it's duplicitous.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.160]   So for example, you'll have,
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.680]   I guess my favorite examples of this
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.320]   are Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire."
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.360]   ♪ I fell into a burning ring of fire ♪
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.840]   Then what does he do with the lyrics in the tune?
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.640]   ♪ I went down, down, down ♪
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.960]   He goes up, right?
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.880]   And so the idea is like, oh, okay, that was a head fake.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.480]   Right, and another one of these
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.840]   is Nina Simone's "Feeling Good."
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.400]   Well, okay, so what do you get?
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.720]   ♪ Birds flying high ♪
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.800]   ♪ You know how I feel ♪
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.160]   ♪ And sun up in the sky ♪
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.800]   ♪ You know how I feel ♪
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.800]   That woman's voice, she doesn't give a damn,
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.640]   and yet she's just--
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.960]   - And I feel it, but then what's the,
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.360]   ♪ Da-dum, da-dum ♪
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.280]   It's like heavy stripping music.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.680]   You're not in a good place.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.240]   You're probably in some strip club
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.560]   with some last of your money. - Some shady.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.240]   - You're drinking lousy beer, some bad situation.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.480]   And she's feeling good?
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.720]   No, it's funereal.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.600]   It's oppressive, right?
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.720]   - I never thought of that song that way, wow.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.320]   - Well, you think of it as joyous?
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.320]   - Yeah. - No, no, no.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.960]   If you think about it, contrast it with Ray Charles,
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.360]   for example, you know, do you know "Lonely Avenue"?
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.080]   ♪ Well, my room has got two windows ♪
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.840]   ♪ But the sunshine never comes through ♪
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.360]   It's really depressed.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.040]   It's the same sort of vibe as Nina,
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.840]   but she's claiming that she's in great shape.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.400]   So she's like a good case of the unreliable narrator.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.760]   Leonard Cohen, to me, is talking
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.920]   about the unreliable audience that's too cool
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.840]   to be with the performer on stage.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.120]   There are things that go with the music,
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.280]   like the Cole Porter stuff,
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.560]   that go against, like the Johnny Cash.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.280]   I think these are the games that musicians play
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.200]   that the rest of us only sort of notice subliminally, okay?
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.040]   Fourth, the fifth.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.880]   Then he, when he, he should say something
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.920]   about the relative minor or the,
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.680]   he's giving you the secret, the baffled king.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.280]   In other words, he doesn't know why it works.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.920]   Did Pachelbel know why Pachelbel's Canon would work?
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.080]   It was a discovery.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.120]   That's the whole thing.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.680]   Like some music is discovered and some music is invented.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.240]   And he's talking about a musical discovery.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.040]   He's talking about the Pythagorean power
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.960]   of the wave equation and then superimpose,
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.880]   like there's two genius intellectual concepts behind music.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   One of which is the wave equation.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.960]   Usually we solve it for a one-dimensional medium
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.920]   because we're talking about strings or air columns.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.600]   Occasionally you're talking about things like handpans
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.200]   or steel drums or metallophones or gamelans, whatever.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.760]   And those have a wave equation too that's much more chaotic.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.720]   The other equation is this crazy thing
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.760]   that two to the 19/12 is almost exactly equal to three,
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.920]   which is what gave us even temperament.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.760]   And so the tension between those two things is in fact
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.760]   one of these most beautiful stories.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.240]   Inside of that system,
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.320]   that formula of the baffled king is a discovery.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.080]   He's not really composing it.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.760]   The reason he's baffled,
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.640]   imagine that you took like a little brush
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.360]   and you started brushing off a pyramid under the sands.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.600]   You might think that you created the pyramid
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.240]   by your brushing, but in fact somebody else did it.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.840]   That's why you're baffled, right?
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.120]   - That's beautifully put, you're right.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.960]   As creating one of the greatest songs of all time
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.120]   and as he's doing it, he's baffled.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.280]   And it's matter of he's within the song.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.680]   - And he, Leonard, is baffled is my contention.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.080]   But he knows enough to know that he's baffled.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.920]   And so the idea is that he is composing.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   He has the audacity to compose as David.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.560]   He's echoing David at a minimum.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.680]   And then in a later song,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.000]   which I really wish we would discuss
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.520]   that's totally dystopic and you will not like it at all,
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.960]   is "The Future," which contains this line
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.000]   that I think I used in my episode
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.520]   with Roger Penrose on the portal.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.960]   Note the subtle plug.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.480]   - The portal, the portal, the portal.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.960]   - He says, "I'm the little Jew that wrote the Bible."
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.440]   So there is this way in which Leonard Cohen, I think,
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.480]   is constantly coming to the idea
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.960]   of being a biblical-like scribe.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.520]   And I think this is one of the great things
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.480]   that you see Dylan doing this with all along the Watchtower.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.920]   You saw Warren Zeevon, who we should talk much more about,
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.200]   doing this with a song called "I Was in the House
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   When the House Burned Down."
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.400]   Do you know this?
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.800]   - No, this is embarrassing.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.520]   - Sweetheart, this is a great day to be alive.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.400]   Warren Zeevon is one of the most important songwriters
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.240]   of our time.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.920]   And he's been largely forgotten by this generation.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.880]   But Bob Dylan would sing one of his songs in tribute.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.040]   I've heard Bob Dylan, you know,
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.240]   very small number of songwriters really move him.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.240]   Woody Guthrie, Gordon Lightfoot, and Warren Zeevon.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.060]   By the way, Bob Dylan, if you're out there,
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.320]   appear on either one of our podcasts.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.620]   We need to get your voice into a new medium for a new group.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.460]   - Definitely.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.560]   - This is a time for Bob Dylan, my friend.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.720]   Honestly, you've been doing an amazing job in this space.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.960]   One of the reasons I'm super excited
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.120]   to do this podcast again is that
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.240]   I've learned some things about what I don't do well.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.240]   And I also have sort of struggled with the question,
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.720]   should I do those things better?
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.480]   Because what if it's, you know,
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.560]   I always use the same example of the fitted sheet.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.780]   When you're trying to put a queen-size fitted sheet
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.280]   on a king-size mattress, he's like,
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.760]   "Okay, I got that corner squared away."
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.400]   And then you get another corner that pops off
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.320]   and then you go back around.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.440]   I wonder whether I can improve my style
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.840]   in the ways in which, you know,
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.900]   I think it's just a recognition of a difference.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.120]   You do a better job of getting to the soul
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.480]   of a really top intellectual guest
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   and making them accessible and presenting them as themselves
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.320]   for a huge number of people.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.280]   And I'd give my eye tooth to be able to do that.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.000]   - Do you ever think about this?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.160]   Like, 'cause I think about
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.560]   what is the greatest conversation I'll ever have?
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.680]   You know, like, in a sense, the portal,
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.720]   not to reduce it to anything,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.860]   but there will be the greatest conversation.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.720]   You may have already had it, but it's very possible.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.300]   If enough people like me can keep twisting your arm
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.180]   to keep doing the portal, please,
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.100]   that is, there'll be an amazing conversation.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.060]   And one of the questions that I ask myself is like,
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.460]   who is the person that I'm especially equipped,
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.080]   for some reason, I'm convinced on Putin.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.220]   There's something in my head that says,
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:30.080]   I can do this man better than anyone else in this world.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.880]   I got this thought in my head about it, I don't know why.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.580]   And I'm convinced, but I think the universe
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.420]   works in that way.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.160]   Like, if it tells you, it's gonna happen.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.620]   - The way I would say it is that almost everybody
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.320]   who becomes a Supreme Court justice
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.980]   believes at a very early age
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.540]   they're going to become a Supreme Court justice.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.060]   Many people believe at an early age
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.860]   that they can do it, don't get there.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.020]   But of those who get there,
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.740]   almost all of them had this sort of,
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.900]   well, I call it pathological self-confidence.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.000]   And I do think you have pathological self-confidence,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.500]   and you also have humility.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.580]   And most people would hear those as a contradiction.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.420]   I think that you would not be able to get away
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.840]   with what you do if you didn't have the humility.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.420]   And so I think the great danger
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.060]   is that your equation becomes unbalanced,
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.700]   that you either lose the humility,
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.780]   or you lose the humility overwhelms the ego
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.740]   and the drive, because right now
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.740]   you've got a Mexican standoff in your mind,
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.540]   and the rest of us are just benefiting.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.680]   - That's beautifully put.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.180]   - My Mexican standoffs aren't as stable as yours.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.340]   (laughing)
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.380]   It's all reservoir dogs all the time.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.220]   - Yeah.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.820]   - But actually, the person who that describes is Peter Thiel.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.260]   Peter Thiel thinks more, people always say,
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.260]   what does Peter think about X, Y, and Z, P, and Q?
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.220]   It's like, well, do you want communist Peter?
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.060]   Do you want hyper-capitalist Peter?
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.780]   - There's multiple minds in there.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.620]   - Oh my God, right, on everything.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.580]   That's why he's successful,
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.740]   is that he's got all these minds fighting each other.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.140]   And so when people say, Peter is this, or Peter is that,
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.980]   I just laugh, because nobody who knows him
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.500]   would describe him as having thoughts
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.540]   at the level that people are claiming.
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.180]   And I do think that, in my case,
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:14.820]   there's also pathological epistemic humility.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:19.820]   Like, just, I know how little I can do in one life.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.740]   I know how many things I've screwed up.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.220]   I know how many things I've got wrong.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.420]   And on the other hand, I know that if not,
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.140]   it's like Hillel's questions,
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.380]   if I'm not for myself, who will be for me?
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.220]   And if I'm only for myself, what am I, if not now, when?
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.940]   At some level, there's a question about,
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.180]   if I don't decide that someone is capable
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.220]   and that that somebody is me,
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.140]   and if I apply that to everyone else on the planet,
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.500]   then nobody's gonna do anything.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.620]   And so I do think that one of the things
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.780]   that people like you and I get is,
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.100]   who are you to say that?
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.940]   F that, man.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.360]   Just sign me up for some Dunning-Kruger.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.940]   - Yeah, but it's multiple minds, like you said.
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.980]   Like, this morning, I was feeling so good and confident
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.300]   about, I could think no wrong.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.300]   And I remember last night clearly thinking
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.780]   that I'm the dumbest human who's ever lived,
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.740]   and nothing I've ever said is worth anything.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.580]   What the fuck am I doing with my life?
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.740]   Why am I scared?
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.340]   I was terrified of this conversation.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.020]   Who the hell am I? - This conversation?
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.180]   - 'Cause I'm an idiot.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.100]   - Lex.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.140]   - But no, no, no, but this morning,
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.420]   I was the baddest motherfucker who's ever walked this Earth.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.780]   So I was very conscious.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.340]   I think it was the coffee, I'm not sure, maybe some sleep.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.500]   - This sounds very Russian,
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.140]   and it involves multiple beverages,
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.980]   some of them being alcoholic, others containing caffeine.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.660]   - There's, in fact, I can't share the story behind it,
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.220]   but there is a bottle of vodka in the fridge.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.700]   - Okay. (laughing)
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.540]   - So, I mean, I should've--
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.180]   - I should've hit you for coffee,
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.620]   'cause this is a morning show here.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.060]   - So I put out a call that we get a chance
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.180]   to have this conversation,
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.540]   and people ask these wonderful questions.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:13.440]   A few people asked about depression and suicide.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.500]   This is a Russian program, so we'll have to go there.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.020]   And I think about Leonard Cohen,
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:26.020]   and one of the things that always kind of broke my heart
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:31.580]   and kind of suffocated the hope I have for just,
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:36.820]   I don't know, for love in a person's life,
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.460]   is to hear how much depression
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.620]   was a part of Leonard Cohen's life,
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.940]   and how much he suffered.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.260]   I guess one way, I'm not sure where we can go
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.620]   with this question, but do you think about the places
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.300]   that the mind can go, like these dark places?
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.460]   - Yeah.
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:00.140]   - Is there something, like, where the only escape out
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.980]   is suicide, for example, that's the darkest version of it?
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.460]   - That, I really think suicide is a big place,
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.940]   and suicidal ideation and self-harm,
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.480]   and we don't talk a lot about it.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.300]   It's a similar problem to trying to talk about trans.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.260]   These are umbrella categories,
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.380]   and if the commonality is that somebody harms themselves,
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.660]   but we don't know whether that's coming
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.000]   because of a problem in brain chemistry,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.040]   because of an event in their life,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.500]   whether evolutionary programming for suicide
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.580]   is weirdly normal, whether or not
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.780]   it might have a religious motivation.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.620]   There's too many different forms of self-harm,
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.280]   and something like the 10th largest killer, thereabouts.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.820]   And I think that you can look at it from different angles.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:58.620]   I'm old enough to have had Pete Seeger come to my college
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:03.620]   when I was at university, and to watch his good humor
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.440]   in the face of all adversity.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.860]   I think of Odetta, I used to go to Odetta concerts,
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.860]   and I don't know if you know who she is.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.580]   Okay, this is gonna be one of the better days of your life.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.220]   Check out Odetta when we're done with the interview.
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.220]   She was a civil rights figure,
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:26.220]   but also just had a profound voice, and great musicianship.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.340]   These people were in the struggle,
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.880]   and they saw lots of bad things happen,
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.680]   and they kept their humor about them.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:41.660]   The thing is that you can take on the Weltschmerz,
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.580]   the pain of the planet, or you can try to do something else,
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.300]   which is to be a happy warrior,
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.540]   even if the odds are terrible,
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.220]   and the cost of failure is catastrophic.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.440]   - So even when surrounded by darkness.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.420]   But the thing is with Leonard Cohen,
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.760]   is he created such beautiful music,
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.300]   and yet it's like Anthony Bourdain, the same.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:11.460]   And yet they go to this dark place,
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.440]   and it could be, it's easy to say it's just biochemistry.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.120]   - No, there's a linkage between
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.860]   this highly generative creative side,
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.620]   and in some cases, dark depression.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.900]   In other cases, not.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.440]   So you can't say that it's tied,
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.220]   that genius and madness are always co-traveling,
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.600]   or that beauty and pain are one and the same.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.420]   What you can say is that there's a cluster of people
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.280]   that tell you that for that cluster,
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.700]   there is a relationship between the darkness and the beauty.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.500]   And I do think that in part,
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.980]   it's squaring circles that can't be squared.
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:54.820]   We were just talking before about the inability
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.600]   to serve two perfect systems,
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.860]   the perfect system of the wave equation,
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.280]   and the perfect system of even temperament.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.660]   They're both perfect, they're not compatible.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.980]   And once you realize that there is perfection
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.100]   and an inability to make contact with perfection,
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:16.540]   I think you recognize that
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:21.540]   there is no solution to this world.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.920]   - Yeah, that's weird with the poets and musicians.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.860]   You wanna say this is a particular thing that you do,
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.100]   but then there's Spanish Fly by Van Halen.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.900]   And then you realize, oh.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.940]   - Well, what do you get out of Spanish Fly by Van Halen?
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.660]   I think it's very singular because of the fact
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.300]   that it's purely acoustic.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.580]   - For some reason, I couldn't imagine Eddie Van Halen
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.100]   separate from the band in front of thousands of people
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.480]   just screaming and rocking out with lights everywhere.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.900]   And Spanish Fly made me think like,
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.740]   it made me imagine him sitting alone
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.580]   in a couch in a room.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.660]   - I think that's who he was, I really do.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.340]   Believe me, I get it.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.660]   He was a rock star, he was a rock god.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.220]   Got it, got it, got it, got it.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.120]   And I'm almost positive that you can't get
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.420]   to where he got to without being a complete introvert.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.060]   - Yeah, it made me imagine that there's some
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:20.020]   half-naked supermodel walking around
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:24.500]   hoping that they can do their thing together.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.260]   And Eddie's completely disinterested.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.100]   He'd be with the guitar.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.900]   - He'd be with the guitar, right?
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:33.380]   Because honestly, at some level, in one case,
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.940]   maybe you're conquesting, maybe you're pursuing
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.800]   love and romance, in the other case,
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.860]   you're talking about a relationship to the order,
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.500]   the creator, the almighty, whatever it is
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.780]   you wanna call that substrate that is reality.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:51.240]   And do I believe that Eddie Van Halen
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.900]   and Jimi Hendrix and Paganini and Heifetz
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.520]   jacked into the true essence of the world?
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.740]   Yeah, they did.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.700]   I don't think it's as good as differential geometry.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.540]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:05.840]   I do think it's amazing for other reasons
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.020]   and thank God because it's very difficult
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.340]   to communicate differential geometry at scale.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.180]   But the thing about eruption, for example,
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.360]   what level do you wanna come in to eruption?
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.260]   Do you want just the sheer majesty and pageantry?
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.060]   Do you want the theatrics?
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.900]   Like you could put him on wires
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.060]   and set his pants on fire or whatever.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.500]   It'd be totally in keeping with it.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.660]   On the other hand, you wanna talk something
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:33.660]   completely precise that shows off the virtuosity
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.400]   of what's possible with a Stratocaster.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.160]   Everything works.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.000]   Multi-axis.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.480]   - But there's a precision to it
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.040]   which is very different than Hendrix.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.040]   There's a messiness to Hendrix that to me,
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.360]   somebody who has OCD has always been a struggle.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.620]   - How does Hendrix affect you?
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.580]   I mean, let's have the Jimi Hendrix conversation.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.840]   I don't know that we can do anything to it
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.120]   that hasn't already been done to it.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:56.960]   Maybe that's not true.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.960]   Maybe the idea is that every generation
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.260]   has to have its Hendrix conversation
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.100]   and this is a long form pocket.
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.600]   - It's Jimi Hendrix experience.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.920]   - Yeah.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.760]   - So funny.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.280]   I hear he sold it from Joe Rogan.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.120]   - Yeah.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.560]   There's so many details.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:16.560]   One, it hurt my soul on so many levels
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.160]   that you can put a thumb over the guitar
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.520]   to play a note, to hold the note.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.760]   And it doesn't, because I wanted to be the Russian virtuoso
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.000]   that sits with his classical guitar in perfect form,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.760]   plays really fast with the fingers
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.280]   and then you want the thumb to be perfectly relaxed
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.120]   and supported.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.040]   - So that's the Russian conservatory student.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.680]   - Conservatory, yeah.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.360]   - Then there's the Russian wild man.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.200]   - Which one is that?
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.600]   - Well, they're different Russian archetypes, right?
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.480]   So the completely idiosyncratic Russian
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.600]   is very different in a weird way from the,
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.040]   you know, I can do this backwards in any key,
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.360]   in my sleep and in any time signature
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.080]   that you, you know, just snap your fingers.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   We've discussed my piano tuner in previous episodes.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.520]   - No, no, that was offline conversation.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.680]   You told me the story.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.160]   - I should tell you the story.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.480]   - You should retell the story.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.880]   - There I was in darkest Manhattan
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.000]   with the world's shittiest, it wasn't even an upright,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.800]   it was a spinet piano.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.600]   A friend had given it to me.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.520]   The piano fell out of tune and I would have to tune it.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.960]   And the only tuner I knew was this Russian guy
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.480]   and I hated dealing with him.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.800]   There was something about his attitude
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.120]   that just really rubbed me the wrong way.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.320]   So anyway, my wife says, "Tune that thing."
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.560]   So we get the piano tuner to come and he's tuning this.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.960]   He's like, "Are you sure you wanna tune this piece of shit?"
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.400]   You know, okay, fine.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.240]   So he's like, "Okay, it's your money."
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.840]   The phone rings and I have the phone ringer set
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.400]   on a landline to Paganini Caprice 24.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.440]   And immediately as the phone rings,
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.000]   he figures out what key the phone ringer is
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.520]   and which is not the key that like Liszt composed
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.480]   the variations on Caprice 24.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   And he starts going into theme and variations
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.840]   on Caprice 24 at some level I've never heard before,
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.120]   just jaw dropping it.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.960]   And like the phone stops ringing
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.600]   and we have this awkward silence.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.480]   I said, "I didn't know you were such a great piano player."
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.960]   And then he says one of these things
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.400]   that in Russian accented English,
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.000]   hurts in a way you can't imagine.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.880]   He said, "No, you are the piano player.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.000]   "I am merely the piano tuner."
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.840]   (laughing)
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.480]   I was just like, oh man, through the heart.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.080]   - You know, it's kind of reminiscent.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.560]   I'd love to hear actually your opinion on this.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.160]   It's reminiscent of the Goodwill hunting story.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.760]   What do you think about that?
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.600]   - That movie?
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.440]   - That movie.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.260]   - What about it?
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.100]   - It's MIT.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.600]   - Yeah, I guess when I think of that film,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.180]   I think about Matt Damon as a young guy,
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:00.120]   risking everything, giving up Harvard.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.800]   I think probably the most accomplished group of people
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.160]   in the world are people who choose
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.880]   to give up Harvard voluntarily.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.400]   - Beautiful. - Right?
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.220]   - That's true.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.060]   - Bigger than Harvard.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:10.900]   - That's very true.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.660]   - Ives was one of these people, Bill Gates, of course.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.320]   And then oddly--
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.280]   - Zuckerberg.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.100]   - What?
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:21.940]   Zuckerberg.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.560]   But then Steve Jobs gave up a Reed.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.860]   And Reed is like the weirdest, craziest college
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.700]   in the world.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.200]   People should pay much more attention to Reed.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.800]   And I'm sorry it's going through a hard time at the moment,
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.900]   but what it was before the current craziness
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.040]   is really an interesting story.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.860]   Irregardless, as we say in the 617 area code,
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:45.060]   I think that a lot of my reaction is to the real story
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.220]   of Matt Damon having this vision
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.900]   and being the young guy to pull it off.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.500]   And I also think about Robin Williams
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:57.500]   trying to explore heart through this lens of acting.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:03.060]   And as you and I, you've hung out with comedians,
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:07.660]   they know that they already screwed up a bunch of people.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.500]   They do.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.220]   They're proud about it.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.800]   They really are.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.360]   The idea that Robin Williams, who I saw many years ago
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.000]   when I was in LA in the comedy clubs around here,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.900]   he was a straight up crazy, disregulated genius
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.500]   in tremendous pain.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:28.900]   And his desire to do it earnestly through acting
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.580]   rather than constantly by just sniping,
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.940]   you know, or being a clown,
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:39.100]   or showing us how fast his mind worked relative to ours.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.340]   I was really moved by that.
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:45.780]   I thought that he brought some authenticity
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.420]   and took a huge risk for a comedian to be that real.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.420]   And again, like you said, it doesn't always have to be,
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.340]   but in that case, the madness and the genius were neighbors.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.580]   - That one couldn't have been any other way.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.420]   - Yeah.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.260]   - No, because his mind,
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.100]   the thing about seeing him in a comedy club
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.220]   was that he would react to random stimulus
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.900]   in the environment.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.740]   You know, it could be a heckler.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:10.860]   Sometimes you almost got the feeling
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.940]   that he wanted a heckler
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:16.820]   because it gave him something to play against, right?
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.860]   He was infinitely, instantly inventive.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:24.300]   - But I actually, to me, the best Robin Williams
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.960]   is as he got closer and closer to the end of his life,
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.260]   because there was a sadness
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.500]   and he's almost fighting the sadness
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.220]   with this improvisational,
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:40.320]   like the weapons he has is this wit and humor
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.820]   and this dancing that he does with language.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.140]   But, and then sometimes when you just fall silent,
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.300]   you can see the sadness.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.580]   And I don't know, there's something so beautiful about that.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.180]   It's like this bird with a broken wing
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.420]   that's like trying to fly, you know,
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.060]   and it's getting older and older.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.700]   I mean, those, he would have made
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.620]   a one hell of a podcast guest, I'll tell you that.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.860]   That's a sad.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.980]   - Yeah, I have some sadness that I really do think
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.020]   that part of what we call podcasting
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.500]   is actually just getting to know a soul
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.740]   over and over again.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:19.140]   Like maybe the idea is that this is talking
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:24.140]   about depression and sadness and heavy feelings
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.080]   is not an American specialty.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.340]   Seeing that in context with the beauty of life
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.060]   is a Russian specialty.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.960]   Like it is very much.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.980]   - Sounds like a diner menu.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.820]   - What? - Yeah.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:39.980]   - You want the Russian specialty?
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.220]   (laughing)
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.700]   - A big scoop of ice cream with tons of depression.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.380]   I do think that we're in a really terrifying
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.580]   and depressing time.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.620]   And I think that part of it is that we don't know
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.380]   if something huge is about to get started.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.300]   And we don't even know what this is.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.940]   I mean, we just sit here in this weird world
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.500]   that is falling into some new state.
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.380]   And we're not even super curious.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.740]   It's like, what the hell just happened?
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:09.940]   Everybody's got an answer.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.120]   And I'm positive that all of those answers are wrong.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.460]   - Let's try to at least sneak up on the good answer.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.860]   - So the central core of the answer is that the US
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.180]   seemed to be the greatest thing in the world
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.560]   in large measure because we hadn't noticed
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.720]   that we were getting a benefit from having no plan,
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.300]   not having to make a plan for low growth.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:38.060]   As long as we had growth, we were in great shape.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.120]   Let's imagine that there was this,
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.860]   you could run an experiment.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.580]   You have a billion copies of earth
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.340]   and you start the initial condition slightly different.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.820]   On some giant number of planets,
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.680]   a lot of the things that were discovered
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.860]   from the 1800s through the end of the 20th century
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.540]   are discovered in a period of time
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.980]   because a lot of that just has to do with
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.900]   once you crack the puzzle of getting better instruments,
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.140]   you can see more.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.180]   And the more you can see,
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.140]   the more you can make use of what you can see.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.900]   And it turns out there was lots of stuff to do
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:18.900]   with like germs or electron orbitals
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.980]   or spectrum, electromagnetic spectrum.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.420]   And so we got to do all of those things.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.380]   And the US roughly corresponded
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.540]   for a good chunk of its history with this bonanza.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.220]   And so of course we look like an amazing genius country.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.860]   We have no plan.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.460]   Imagine that you could sell a car.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.740]   You don't have to put in seat belts.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.740]   You don't have to put in airbags.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.500]   You don't have to put in rear view mirrors
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.620]   or sensors or a rear view mirror.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.720]   You could save a lot of money on a car
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.980]   by not putting in all of the stuff
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.580]   to keep things from going wrong.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.260]   And I think that's what we had.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.700]   We had a machine that as long as growth was insanely good,
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.380]   we plowed it back, the riches and spoils and treasure
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.820]   back into the system and made more genius stuff.
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.100]   And we carried along a good chunk of humanity,
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.340]   hundreds of millions of people.
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.500]   We did not have a plan for what happens
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.300]   when the growth goes below the stall speed of our society.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:19.460]   - How confident should we be that the growth has slowed
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.540]   in a way that is permanent rather than--
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.540]   - It's not permanent.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.380]   - Slap in the face where--
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.820]   - It's not the right concept.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.660]   Right concept is, I try to use the same words
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.380]   over and over again in case people see mold
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.820]   because then the perseveration actually gets somewhere.
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.040]   So I use this analogy of the orchard
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.580]   because everyone talks about low-hanging fruit.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.540]   They know the concept of low-hanging fruit,
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.260]   but they don't think in terms of orchards.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.700]   So they say things like,
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.660]   "You think we've picked all the low-hanging fruit,
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.740]   "but I believe in the infinite inventiveness
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.980]   "of the human mind."
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:54.820]   - Yeah.
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.660]   - It's like, okay, that doesn't even work as an analogy.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.100]   What if the idea is we only picked
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.780]   all the low-hanging fruit here
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.340]   and then we're having this stupid argument
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.100]   about low-hanging fruit and we're not going
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.900]   and looking for new orchards?
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.120]   We're not planting new orchards,
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.820]   we're not looking for forests.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.880]   We're just sitting here arguing about low-hanging fruit.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.420]   So my claim is there's probably a lot more
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.700]   low-hanging fruit and it's not here.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.740]   - It's in other orchards.
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:17.580]   - It's in other orchards.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.060]   One of those turned out to be the digital orchard.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.780]   The digital orchard has not been as stagnant
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:28.440]   as lots of these other, like the chemical orchard.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:33.540]   - I have faith that there's a small percentage
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.460]   of the population, but not zero,
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.300]   that's looking for those other orchards.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.460]   Like I'm excited about one of those orchards,
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.860]   which is, I believe there'll be robots in everybody's homes
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:48.100]   and that will unlock some totally new thing.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.820]   Totally new set of technologies, ideas,
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:56.500]   the way we live life, the productivity, everything.
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.620]   It'll change everything.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.220]   So I'm excited about that orchard.
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.620]   So I'm roaming that orchard and wondering
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.580]   how the hell you kind of bring back
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.540]   like the ant that finds a new source of food.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.380]   I'm trying to find an apple I can bring back
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.580]   to the rest of the--
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:16.100]   - Great, so you're in an explorer idiom.
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.300]   - And you have faith that there's enough of those.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.140]   - I don't think there are very many of us.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.100]   I mean, I'm one of them too.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.220]   - How many does it take?
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.120]   It takes one ant.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.420]   - It takes one ant.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.660]   What are you talking about?
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.780]   - How many elons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.220]   - Okay, let's imagine that we went,
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.260]   imagine some ant goes and finds a new source of food.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:42.300]   And then it comes back to the colony and it says,
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.700]   "Hey, I think I found a new source of food."
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.820]   And the initial reaction is,
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.780]   "You're not authorized to find new food."
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.220]   - What?
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.740]   - Why would you try to go find new food?
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.220]   - We're gonna remove you from Twitter.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.180]   - Yeah, and by the way, I think the fact
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.620]   that you think you're allowed to go find new food
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.440]   shows how privileged you are as an ant.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.500]   Get out of the colony.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.940]   Kill him, kill him!
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.780]   Well, that's probably not a great model
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.460]   for finding new orchards.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.020]   And I think that what we find is that
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.900]   where there's a system that allows somebody to ascend
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.580]   without a lot of gatekeeping, you can have that.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.580]   But I saw this happen in hedge funds.
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:22.580]   Hedge funds for a while hoovered up a lot of talent
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:26.380]   because they were places that had funding and had freedom.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:32.020]   And in general, really smart people want to be free
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.020]   and they don't want to think a lot about
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.300]   how they're gonna feed themselves.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.980]   They want to get lost in their minds.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.840]   So you can either give them productive places to play,
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.460]   dangerous places to play.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.420]   They're either gonna break into computers
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:52.420]   or find vaccines for you or build bombs or build companies.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:58.140]   And we're not providing for the people who have to disrupt
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:01.520]   and have to innovate and trying to channel that effort.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.020]   We're so focused on this other thing,
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.160]   which is like fairness and safety.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.300]   And fairness and safety, by the way, are really important.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.200]   I don't want to denigrate them.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.900]   But the singular focus on fairness and safety
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.700]   without in the same breath being focused on growth
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.340]   and discovery and creation is gonna doom us
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.620]   because what we're talking about is we're always talking
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:25.620]   about divvying up the pie that is
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.500]   as opposed to the pie that will be.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.920]   Imagine that you spent all your time
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.580]   trying to divvy up the 13th century pie
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:36.380]   and you destroyed your ability to get to the 20th century.
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.140]   You'd be an idiot.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:42.460]   - But one place I think I disagree with you is
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.060]   I don't think you need that many people
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.340]   to empower the geniuses, the innovators,
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.860]   the people who refuse to spend most of their days
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.260]   in meetings about fairness.
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.780]   - This is good.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.840]   Let's have a disagreement.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.000]   - I think podcasting, whatever you call that medium,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.420]   is just one little example of a tool
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.520]   that you can give power to.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:09.100]   Like you and your podcast can have the next Elon Musk
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:09.940]   and make him a star.
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.180]   - Now I see where you're going.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.020]   Okay.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.100]   There have been a series of places
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.320]   for people to play and be free.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.940]   And we've lost them successively.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.460]   - What's a good place you remember?
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.220]   'Cause I disagree with you there too.
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.580]   I think they're still there.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:25.660]   You can still play.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.200]   - You interviewed Noam Chomsky.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.200]   - Yes.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.040]   - Okay.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.200]   Noam Chomsky comes from an era--
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.160]   - Where you can play?
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.240]   - Where you could play.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.080]   - At MIT.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.200]   - At MIT.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.040]   - And you can't play.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.320]   This is where I disagree with you.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.080]   - We've already had this.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.760]   Go check the Clips channel, the Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.720]   - I think I wasn't brave enough at that time
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.880]   and I'm not really brave enough now.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.720]   - Come on.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.620]   Where's the vodka?
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:54.680]   - It's a feeling and people are gonna tear me apart.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:58.260]   - Oh, what are you, you speak from emotion and facts?
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.420]   - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.260]   - The feeling--
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.080]   - Which podcast is this?
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:01.920]   It's yours.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.760]   - Yes.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.920]   - Okay, tell the people who are currently editing your brain
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.240]   'cause I saw that move right now.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.820]   That they should go find another podcast.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.660]   Right?
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.920]   Let's get rid of some of your audience right now.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.500]   - Please go find another podcast
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.660]   if you're editing my brain.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.620]   Nevertheless, all the self-doubt,
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.900]   they're sitting in that brain.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.500]   - Oh my God, I can't stand to watch this.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.340]   But all right.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.640]   But what is this self-doubt loop that you're in?
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   - The thing is, when I walk the halls of MIT,
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.500]   there's bureaucracy, there's administrators
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.040]   that never have done anything interesting
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.520]   in their entire lives.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.280]   There's meetings, there's--
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.120]   - All the usual crap.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.240]   - All the usual crap.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.800]   But there's, in the eyes of individuals,
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.520]   there's this glow of excitement
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.760]   that has nothing to do with career.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.200]   - I understand this.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.880]   - And it's still a playground.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.740]   There's little pockets of playgrounds
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.120]   from which genius can emerge still.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.360]   And they're unaffected by diversity meetings
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.580]   or fairness meetings or blah, blah, blah.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:05.540]   - I love to hear that.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:06.380]   - Yeah?
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.200]   You don't think so?
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.840]   - I don't believe it.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.260]   'Cause I've watched the change, Lex.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.340]   I've watched people,
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.620]   we're all editing ourselves all the time.
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.180]   I remember my old mind, I liked it better.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:21.060]   All of this relentless focus on critical race theory
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.220]   and critical theory, post-modernism,
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.180]   fairness, social justice,
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.740]   it's making many of us into worse people.
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.740]   - You think that's, do you think the Matt Damon's
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.780]   of the character is paying attention to any of that?
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:36.620]   You think that has an effect?
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.340]   - Have you seen what happened to Matt Damon himself?
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.120]   Matt Damon has tried to say various things
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.140]   at various times that seem to be relatively innocuous.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.540]   He can't speak.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.420]   - Okay, well let's not mix up.
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.300]   Matt Damon's just an actor.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:52.580]   - No, no, no, no, he was just a Harvard student
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.340]   who came up with his own genius screenplay,
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.980]   acted and made it happen.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.340]   No, we're somewhere else.
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.820]   - You don't think you can build the rocket company
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.420]   out of MIT still?
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.500]   - I think that there are things that you can still do.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:07.380]   - But we're losing them.
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.820]   - We lose them.
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.780]   We keep losing them.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.420]   - I would say the biggest problem,
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:16.100]   here, let me just say what I think the solution would be
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:21.100]   is to fire anybody who's not,
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:23.660]   like faculty, especially young faculty
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.140]   should have way more power
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.820]   and administration should have much less power.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.240]   Because right now the administration,
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.940]   which used some of whom used to be faculty,
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.080]   but they've lost the fire, the spark that gave them,
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.900]   they've lost the memories of the playground.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.380]   And so the people that admire and love the playground,
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.800]   like you could see it in their behavior,
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.820]   should have way more power.
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.940]   And so we should create a systems that give them power.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.500]   - But you're very idealistic.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.540]   And you're very, you've got a huge heart.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:58.660]   It's a weird time, 'cause I don't wanna dissuade you
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:01.060]   from believing beautiful things,
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.260]   because I see how potent you are.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.860]   You do all these things, jiu-jitsu, guitar,
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:11.860]   podcasting, programming computers, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:14.920]   I don't think you're right.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.520]   I think we're in a really deeply screwed up place
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.800]   where even the tiny number of,
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.600]   let me give you an alternate version of this dystopia.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.600]   I do think that there are people who are capable
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.360]   and there's still places to play and cause things to happen
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.600]   that progress the story forward.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.720]   But if you look at the fire that some of the people are in
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.800]   who fit that profile,
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.480]   like how much crap has Elon Musk taken?
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.880]   Quite considerable, right?
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.340]   - And not much admiration from the-
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:50.260]   - Craig Venter, Jim Watson.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.700]   These are very difficult people.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.800]   Steve Jobs is a very difficult guy.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.500]   - It is a bit heartbreaking to me.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.700]   I mean, everybody is different generations.
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.900]   I just, my mind is a little focused on Elon Musk
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.380]   because he's the modern person.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:09.420]   - Well, you know him.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.860]   I mean, he's a person to you.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:16.440]   - It hurts my heart to see how few faculty
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:21.440]   and people with Nobel prizes and so on admire Elon.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:26.860]   Like how little, he gets a lot of fans
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.300]   from like people that buy his products and young minds.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.660]   - Yeah. - Just excited.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:36.100]   But like, why don't we as, why doesn't MIT say that
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:41.480]   somebody amongst us will be the next Elon Musk
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.580]   and we want to encourage them?
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.700]   Like say that, say that in meetings, say that.
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.780]   Like that's success.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:51.140]   - No kidding. - For us as MIT.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:54.140]   And they, instead there's this jealousy.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.980]   It's like, did you hear what Elon Musk tweeted?
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.460]   Did you, like how responsible is what he's doing?
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:04.040]   How, like just saying all these things
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:09.040]   that are just dripping with jealousy and basically-
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.300]   - I want what he's got.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.620]   - That's the thing, right?
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.780]   Here's the weird thing.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.260]   Rivalry has a different signature.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.720]   You see, when you know that you're never gonna make it,
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.100]   that's the position you take.
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:29.940]   What is it in "Kung Fu Panda," which you've watched now?
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.080]   - Yes. - Yes.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:35.380]   What does Tai Lung say when he's looking
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.760]   for the dragon warrior and the Furious Five
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.720]   come to defeat him on the bridge?
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:44.800]   One of them gives up Po's name accidentally
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.200]   and Tai Lung hears it.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.520]   Po, so that is his name.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.520]   Finally, a worthy opponent.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.440]   Our battle will be legendary, right?
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.800]   He's excited.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.360]   Why is that?
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.080]   Well, you learn about this in boxing.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.560]   Sometimes you'll see a division or an MMA,
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.000]   which is lousy with talent.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.360]   Just you can't swing a cat
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.760]   without hitting an amazing, amazing athlete.
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.320]   Sometimes you'll have a division,
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.800]   which at that particular moment has one star
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.600]   and no real competition in that weight class or something.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.600]   That person is in bad shape
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:23.500]   because you can't build a legend without the other.
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.500]   When you think of Muhammad Ali,
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.000]   what are the names that you immediately think of?
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.360]   - You have to phrase your,
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.240]   you have to think of the other heavyweights.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.040]   Liston. - Right.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:40.880]   So those opponents are in part
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.880]   what made Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.880]   And that's why the Mayweather-McGregor revelation
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:54.040]   that, okay, this guy has got his opponent's picture
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:54.880]   in his house.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.940]   How weird is that?
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:58.320]   Well, because without the opponent,
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.660]   you may not be able to get there.
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:04.660]   Now, I am not a huge fan of the wrong kinds of rivalries.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.300]   - Do you have examples in mind?
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.580]   - Well, there are rivalries
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:11.500]   where people take each other's credit
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:12.860]   and screw each other over.
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.480]   And then there are other rivalries like the R&A Thai Club,
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.780]   where these guys were so in love with what they were doing
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.460]   that they couldn't wait to share everything.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.860]   And Nobel Prizes were so abundant
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.000]   that most people got Nobel Prizes
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.100]   just for being a member of the R&A Thai Club
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.060]   and doing cool stuff.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:36.060]   And yeah, that's the golden kind of sweet spot.
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:41.980]   Most of these people can't do what Elon's doing
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:43.220]   because they can't break rules,
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:44.820]   they can't take the pressure.
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.220]   I'll tell you what really concerns me
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.380]   about your perspective.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:51.100]   I think that there are a lot of genius ideas
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.820]   inside of people who don't have the stomach
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.500]   for conflict and derision.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.740]   And I think a lot of those people are female.
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.900]   And I think that until we come up with a world
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.620]   in which we can swat down the trolls,
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.780]   where we can actually cause the trolls
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:10.620]   not to ruin everything.
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.780]   And I don't necessarily mean by shutting them up,
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.900]   I don't necessarily mean by being brutal to them,
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.820]   but somehow separating off people who are working
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.220]   and people who are trolling.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:24.220]   I think that we're losing a huge amount of human genius
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:29.220]   in part because women in particular
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:32.340]   are not necessarily going to push an idea
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.500]   if it results in 10 years of being derided.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:39.980]   Very few men are willing to do that either.
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.420]   But there are some of us who are so dumb
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:45.700]   that we will pig-headedly stick to an idea for 10 years
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.540]   even if the world collapses.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.820]   I don't think that there are as many women
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.820]   who are going to make that calculation
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:53.780]   even if they know the idea is correct.
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.220]   - And one of the things that I believe technology
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.860]   can help us fight the trolls,
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.900]   of all definitions of troll,
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:02.860]   I believe that a better Twitter can be built.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.420]   - Interesting, I do not.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.940]   I don't believe that a Twitter successor can be built
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:10.140]   that solves most of the problems.
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:12.660]   I think you can always improve what we have,
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.780]   but I don't think that converges in something
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.740]   that really works because I think ultimately
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.060]   the problem isn't Twitter, the problem is us.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.460]   For example, I've recently made
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:24.220]   a very disturbing realization,
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:28.180]   which is academics and trolls
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:30.300]   have very many similar behaviors.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.740]   - Absolutely.
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:34.180]   - It's largely a trolling community.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:38.540]   - I tend to believe that the trolls are not,
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:42.140]   it's like the Peter Thiel mini-mind idea.
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:45.100]   Which in all of the trolls,
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:47.820]   there's the possibility of goodness.
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.260]   And all you have to do, not all you have to do,
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.500]   what you have to do is create technology
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.660]   that incentivizes them to embrace,
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:01.700]   to discover, to embrace, to practice
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.220]   the better angels of their nature.
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:09.220]   And I believe that, people actually want to do that.
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:15.020]   The trolls is a short-term dopamine rush
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:20.020]   of childish toxicity that all of us want to overcome.
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:23.420]   I believe that deep within, we want to overcome that.
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:27.540]   - I try to keep myself from believing what you believe.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:31.020]   - Because you'll be disappointed if it's not true.
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.220]   - Because it's dangerous, because a lot of these people
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:36.020]   are implacable foes and there aren't many of them,
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.060]   but when you meet somebody who's like,
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.980]   yeah, I just like screwing people up.
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.080]   I'm here for the pain.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.660]   - I just believe even in them, there's a good--
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.620]   - There's a wonderful book that I'm gonna recommend to you
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.180]   where I hope this comes from.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.660]   Maybe I've got the source wrong,
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:52.460]   but in any event, it's a great book
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:55.560]   called Maximum City about Bombay.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:56:00.500]   And I believe the conceit is that the author
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:04.260]   leaves Bombay as a kid and comes back as an adult
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.620]   and he realizes he has to rediscover the city
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:09.420]   because he can't live in the city he left.
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:12.820]   So he gets in contact with all of the weird areas
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.460]   of the city and one of them is the underworld.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:17.700]   He hangs out with the police, but in the underworld,
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.940]   he's talking to contract killers.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:22.620]   And he says, you know, it's really weird.
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:26.480]   Everybody pleads for their life right before I kill them.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.960]   And they always say this thing about I've got two kids
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:31.800]   at home.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.660]   He says, never say that to a contract killer
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.740]   because we have terrible relationships with our parents.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.020]   Doesn't it derise you?
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.260]   (laughing)
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.620]   And I was just thinking, oh, wow.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:44.100]   So there's a minus sign in front of that statement.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.420]   You're sitting there saying, you know,
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.460]   I've got a three-year-old.
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:50.020]   It's like, okay, well, I'm gonna take this POS
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.500]   out of that kid's life.
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.220]   Maybe he'll have a chance.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:55.020]   You don't know how people are wired.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:58.700]   And as much as I hate to say it,
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.500]   there are people whose wiring is so disturbing
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:04.900]   and so different from yours that you will never guess
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:08.360]   why you can't reach them or how much pleasure
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:09.980]   they may have gotten because they may have gone
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.960]   over a point of no return.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:15.900]   - Nevertheless, you are just a smart guy
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:19.100]   who is using his intuition to make a hypothesis.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.580]   You do not know this for sure.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:21.700]   - Nope.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:26.180]   - And I am, you know, whatever the hell I am
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:31.140]   that has a different hypothesis that even
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.820]   in the darkest human beings that seem to be
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:38.140]   only full of evil, there's a good person there
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:39.380]   that could be discovered.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.780]   - Lex, one of the reasons I love doing your show
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:46.380]   is that you have these beliefs even as a Russian.
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.220]   (Lex laughing)
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.460]   - The Russian special.
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:52.640]   - As you know, the Russian, there is a weirdness
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.780]   which is a total cynicism and total idealism
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:56.960]   locked together, right?
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:59.360]   That's very much a part of the Russian character.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.460]   - The reason I kept bothering you,
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:04.180]   kept bothering you to have this conversation
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:09.180]   is I'm really worried about the next couple of months.
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.820]   - No kidding.
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:13.980]   - And if there's anybody in this world
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:18.460]   that could help alleviate my worry
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:22.220]   by at least walking along with me
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:26.160]   through this worry of mine, it's you.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.360]   Do you think we're headed towards some kind of civil war,
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.620]   some kind of division that explodes
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:35.100]   beyond just stuff on Twitter,
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:39.260]   but something that's really destructive
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:42.180]   to the fabric of our society?
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:45.580]   - Well, I believe we're in a revolution, as you know.
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.140]   I've called it the no-name revolution
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:48.540]   or N-squared revolution.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.380]   I've been talking about it for years.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:54.940]   I don't think, I think waiting for this
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:57.420]   to be called a civil war is not smart.
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:00.980]   - Only history will call it such, fine.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.180]   - I think that the problem is
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.400]   is that you're encountering things that you've never seen,
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.020]   trying to fit them into things that you already know.
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:07.860]   - Right.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.740]   - But history repeats itself.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:12.140]   - Yes, ish.
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:15.740]   - You don't see lessons from history--
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.340]   - I do. - We see today.
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.180]   - But I don't see it repeating itself.
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.500]   - What about violence?
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.140]   - The famous quote is that it rhymes.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.380]   - It rhymes.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:27.140]   I mean, the thing I guess I'm speaking to is violence.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.780]   - We're in there.
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.900]   The abstraction of violence.
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:35.820]   Imagine you were coding up violence as an abstract class.
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:40.620]   - Thank you for speaking to the audience.
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.180]   - Trying to lose these people.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:43.020]   Come with me.
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:45.700]   - Go on.
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:47.340]   - No, no, no.
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:48.660]   I've dealt with your audience,
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:51.740]   and your audience contains the smartest people around.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:54.220]   I guarantee you if I say some stuff,
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:55.780]   first of all, any wrong thing that I'll say,
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.300]   they're gonna detail, so that'll be a little bit of catnip
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.380]   to bring in the smart people.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.140]   But they'll also digest it for each other.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.500]   It's one of the great lessons of long-form podcasting.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.620]   If you don't waste all your time explaining things,
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:11.260]   that's the job of the audience to do amongst themselves,
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.700]   they're happy doing the work,
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.460]   and those who aren't, they leave.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.280]   Isn't that great?
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.120]   They'll leave.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.540]   The people who don't wanna struggle will leave.
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.220]   You can get rid of them.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.900]   I think that the point is you would want to say
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:28.100]   violence is defined relative to a context.
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.780]   So let's call it meta-violence,
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.100]   so that we don't get into the problem
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.660]   when we already have a term for physical violence.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.500]   So we have meta-violence and physical violence.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.780]   I would say that physical violence
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.660]   is subclassed from meta-violence.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.380]   Meta-violence is the disruption of a system.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:49.220]   For example, if a cell dies,
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:52.340]   it can die through apoptosis or necrosis.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.460]   Apoptosis is controlled, programmed cell death.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.980]   Necrosis is just like, okay, this didn't work.
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.220]   That was a violent disruption of the system.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.740]   - And this meta-class is presumed in the documentation,
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.900]   is it all negative?
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.700]   - No, what are you talking about?
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:14.340]   This is part of the problem in the madness of our age,
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:19.340]   which is if you open up a drawer in your cabinet,
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:26.020]   in your kitchen, and you see knives, spoons, and forks,
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.640]   do you have a sense that the spoons are good utensils
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.600]   and the knives or forks are bad utensils
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.140]   because they're mean?
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.860]   I mean, if you start thinking in these terms,
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.180]   that knife is there to do violence.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.740]   That's violence you want done.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:45.700]   When I cut a mango, I'm doing violence to the mango.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.780]   The mango expects that I will do violence to it
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.460]   because otherwise I won't be able to get the meat
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:56.460]   and it won't get its seed spread somewhere else.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:00.700]   So in part, violence is absolutely part of our story.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:04.300]   - Okay, so there's this meta-violence class.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.140]   - Yeah.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:08.620]   - So the meta-violence class is already,
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.040]   it's a multiple inheritance pattern.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.480]   Whatever's going on right now inherits from meta-violence.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.040]   - No, but there's certain subclasses
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:21.040]   that allow evil to emerge.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.200]   So what I'm specifically worried about is that--
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.440]   - What's on your mind, Lex?
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.380]   What's really going on?
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.220]   - Okay.
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:34.460]   I worry that amidst the chaos of the world,
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.560]   of these protests or the chaos that could be created
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:45.260]   by the feeling that the election does not represent
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.140]   the voice of the people,
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.980]   like saying that whoever gets, quote unquote,
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.620]   wins the election according to some kind of reporting
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.540]   of the numbers that come out,
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:01.220]   that's not going to represent what people actually,
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.860]   people actually want to be the leader.
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:05.180]   Like something in that narrative will create
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:09.060]   so much division that people will resort
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.400]   to literal violence, like protests that really,
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:17.700]   that the United States loses its united aspect.
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:21.840]   And because of that, because of that chaos and tension,
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.840]   evil people, evil forces, that my definition of evil is,
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.620]   you know, just cruel human beings use that moment
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:36.220]   to attain power, the kind of power that ultimately
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.220]   goes against the ideal of the United States.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.780]   That could be Donald Trump,
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.820]   that could be another human being, it doesn't really matter.
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:47.780]   My worry is that love doesn't win out in this.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.980]   The unity doesn't win out in this.
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:54.980]   And I feel like you and I have responsibility.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.980]   - No kidding. - It's small.
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:58.940]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:03.820]   - And so how do we let love win in this moment
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:07.500]   of potential chaos? - We're gonna have to fight for it.
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.860]   You're gonna have to become a fighter.
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.340]   You're gonna have to throw some serious punches
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.820]   if that's what you want.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.300]   - You have to be Muhammad Ali here
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:19.540]   because the moment you start criticizing anything,
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.380]   people, you have to be a masterful communicator because--
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.620]   - That's why you're here.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:31.180]   Look, Lex, in part, your decency is allowing you
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:35.180]   to do things that you couldn't otherwise do.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:38.460]   I saw that you had Michael Malice on your podcast.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.580]   - Yeah.
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:44.500]   - Now Michael Malice is, I think of somebody who at his best
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.380]   is extremely shrewd and insightful, yes?
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:51.340]   He's also got this trolling game,
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.620]   which he's quite open about and you talk to him about it,
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.780]   which I can't stand.
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.220]   And this is the idea, oh, grandpa doesn't get the internet.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.100]   Well, I'm grandpa, I don't get the internet.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.980]   I don't love the trolling.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:06.980]   There are trolls of the past who were incredibly good.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.020]   I don't see any of the modern trolls
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.060]   as being that kind of genius level,
[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.620]   trolling the people who deserve it
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.580]   in the way that they deserve it.
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.180]   Right now what I see is that anything that stands up
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.860]   gets cut down.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:22.220]   It's like anything earnest.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:25.460]   You have to turn it into cynicism and a meme.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.500]   It's this idea that the people who believe
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.860]   that the world is chaos and has no point
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.380]   are constantly trying to let you know,
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.780]   don't try to use the internet for meaning,
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.740]   for decency, for goodness,
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:39.220]   because we are going to find out
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.900]   that that's all sanctimonious hypocrisy
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.540]   and we will make you suffer.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.940]   So I do think that there's a lot of sanctimonious hypocrisy
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.940]   in the world, some of it mine, some of it yours,
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.260]   but we all have it.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:55.420]   And the trolls somewhat remove that,
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.820]   but it's not a judicious, kind, constructive,
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.420]   compassionate, caring version most of the time.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.780]   And a lot of those trolls,
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.700]   and I have this feeling about Michael Malice,
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.660]   I don't know whether it's right,
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:09.020]   that there's somebody who deeply cares and loves beneath it
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.900]   and that that's motivating some of the trolling behavior.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.740]   And you and I don't seem to be doing that.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.620]   I don't see you as almost ever trolling.
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:19.820]   - Yeah, you and I, I'm very much against trolling.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.540]   - I'm very much against trolling.
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.980]   It doesn't mean that it's selective.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.660]   No, it's not even true.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:30.140]   Everything we say, we say, "I'm for it, I'm against it."
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:33.060]   This isn't my native language.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.500]   I speak nuance, I don't speak this internet shit.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:39.820]   And the more I have to communicate
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.420]   through internet shit, right?
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.380]   I almost never take a tweet seriously
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:49.380]   if it contains the letters LMAO, LOL, RTFL, FOL.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.400]   - There's an interesting effect where people say stuff
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.360]   and then finish with LOL.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.720]   You put it beautifully that it indicates to me
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.840]   that this is a person,
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.320]   we've talked about why I wear this stupid suit.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:07.960]   It's like, this is to fight the LOL at the end of sentences.
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.960]   Stand up for the words you're saying.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.700]   Don't finish stuff with LOL,
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.640]   removing completely the responsibility
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.480]   of the content of the sentence that preceded it.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.600]   - Yeah, also, choosing the outfit that worked both
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.520]   for Men in Black and the Blues Brothers,
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.720]   not a terrible choice.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.000]   Okay, but getting back, look, Lex,
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.100]   we're not in a position to do this.
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.580]   You need to be seated in a different chair.
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:37.120]   Your chair is the wrong chair.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.080]   You're in the wrong chair.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.580]   It's been so long.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:44.340]   I wanna talk about you and Joe Biden.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.400]   Joe Biden was a 29-year-old guy
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.820]   with nothing particular going on so far as I can tell.
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:59.460]   I know people as impressive at age 29 as Joe Biden,
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:05.840]   12 rows back, 3D, doesn't matter, huge number of people.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.360]   None of them my age can get to where he got to.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.600]   Like, we're all morons.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.840]   Anytime somebody takes out,
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.600]   like if you found Eddie Van Halen in a guitar shop,
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.960]   you'd be angry.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.940]   What is this guy doing repairing guitars?
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:29.160]   Then somebody would say, "Maybe he loves to repair guitars."
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.280]   - Yeah, I mean, what is your Russian piano tuner doing?
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.640]   - What is my Russian piano,
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.640]   that was the whole point of that story,
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:40.560]   which is what is it that happened in that life
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.720]   that converted somebody?
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.840]   And I find this, for example, with Russian doctors
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.620]   who are technicians in offices now.
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:52.400]   There's a huge amount of talent in the world
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.840]   that's not sitting in its proper seat.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:59.520]   And quite honestly, I've gotten to the point
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.920]   where my feeling is we've got to take the seats.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.800]   - Right.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.840]   - Maybe we don't sit in them.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.480]   Maybe the idea is that we take the seats
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.360]   and we put some smart Gen Z person in the seat
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.560]   and say, "Look, no chanting.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.400]   "I don't wanna hear you say, 'No justice, no peace.'"
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:21.880]   If there aren't verbs, if it rhymes, it's wrong.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.440]   Like I used to have this thing,
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.320]   if it rhymes, things that rhyme are more true.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:29.920]   But in general, if something starts out one, two, three,
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.120]   four, I don't wanna hear what the rest of your sentence is.
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:32.960]   - Yeah.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:38.240]   But I feel like the responsibility that you carry,
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.400]   that I carry, this is where Joe Rogan
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.680]   generally removes himself from being,
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.960]   I'm just a comedian.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.840]   This idea of I'm just a comedian.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.360]   - We all do that.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.520]   - But at this moment in history,
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.240]   like history literally can pivot
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.720]   on the words of a tattooed,
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:04.280]   ripped 50-year-old comedian.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.180]   And I think the same is true with you.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.400]   - Okay, well, I'm interested and I care.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.500]   Speaking of lyrics, there are many here among us
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.040]   who feel that life has been a joke.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.440]   That's not us.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.400]   The hour is getting late.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.800]   That's not us.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.320]   In the song, the joker and the thief
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.800]   are on opposite sides of Jesus
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.640]   having this conversation over Jesus.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.960]   You and I, we've been through that.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.000]   That's not our fate.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.120]   That's somebody else's fate
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.480]   to throw spitballs at the internet.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.640]   That's not your fate.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.860]   You're an earnest guy.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:36.840]   You're filled with love.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.320]   You're getting the most amazing podcast guests.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.160]   Broadcasting-- - But you can win over
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.000]   the internet.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.240]   This is the point I'm trying to make.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.840]   That you're saying I'm just a grandpa.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.680]   I don't get internet.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.280]   - No, no, I'm telling you you're gonna get bigger
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.280]   and then you're gonna get cut down.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.080]   You're gonna keep ascending for a while, Lex.
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.760]   - And then you're saying naturally there's--
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.760]   - I'm telling you, I watch the same process.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.940]   People get up to a certain level
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.240]   and one of the things that's going on,
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.440]   in my opinion, with Joe Rogan
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.960]   is that when Joe Rogan starts to talk
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.800]   about his misgivings about Joe Biden
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.800]   in a way that you find at any bar in America
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.520]   about cognitive decline in a 77-year-old
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.460]   who's about to be 78, I believe in November,
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:20.320]   we have never had anything remotely as insane
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.320]   as a 78-year-old person slated to win the White House.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   - And you're saying when that idea
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.920]   is being communicated,
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.040]   there's something about the disc concept
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.760]   that you talk about the system naturally starts to--
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.400]   - Some bad thing happens to Joe
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.400]   or one of Joe's close associates.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:42.840]   The ability to destroy people who become inconvenient
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.200]   has been documented.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.200]   This is what we have done in the past.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.120]   Whether we are doing it now, we don't know
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.960]   because we are not doing this Church Committee II.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.520]   In order to know whether or not
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:57.040]   you are currently destroying American citizens
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.360]   as we did in the past and as we have documented
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.000]   and as we found out in 1976,
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.560]   the federal government destroyed Americans
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.440]   who had political beliefs
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.400]   that the government didn't want to continue.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.900]   And I don't know whether you are grasping that.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.960]   One interpretation of why Jon Stewart
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.440]   and why Joe Rogan and why Bill Maher,
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.880]   all these people to some extent hide behind,
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.800]   it's a joke.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.200]   It's because they're trying to find a protected class.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.680]   Is there someplace I can stand and speak the truth
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.620]   which does not result in my being garbage collected?
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:37.360]   - Interesting.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.380]   I guess you're right.
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.460]   My intuition is you can stand.
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:46.920]   As you gain more power, you can stand behind your--
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.600]   - There's a fight over Joe Rogan right now.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.740]   I mean, I've talked about it for a few years now.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.560]   People did not understand how big that program was.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.520]   People didn't understand long-form podcasting.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.840]   I was derided by people who I think of as being very shrewd
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.360]   for believing in these podcasts as a major force.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.200]   And most of the people who derided me have said,
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.440]   wow, did I not get things?
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.320]   It's like if you started to propose,
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:17.440]   you wanted to do The Sopranos
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.520]   in the era of 30-minute sitcoms.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.840]   You don't get it, man.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.680]   The American people,
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.920]   they're not interested in these long plot storylines.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.180]   That's your weird thing?
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.880]   Nobody cares, dude.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.880]   Everybody just wants short, fast, memorable.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.960]   And like, okay, so if you do that,
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.440]   you totally miss the opportunity.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.160]   And the savvy people used to say,
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.160]   kid, let me tell you, nobody ever lost a dime
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.000]   underestimating the intelligence of the American people.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.200]   Well, that was totally wrong
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.880]   'cause they didn't calculate opportunity costs.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.480]   I have been talking about the problem of Joe
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.600]   for a long time.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:54.000]   The problem is is that when the system wakes up,
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.560]   they're gonna wanna control it.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.400]   - And they have different,
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.920]   they come up with new different mechanisms of doing that.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.220]   I guess one interesting one is cancel culture.
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.640]   - Well, look at the number of people around Joe
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.560]   who they've come after
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.480]   since they realized that Joe was really big.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.480]   Joey Diaz, Brian Callan, Chris D'Elia.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:22.440]   Now, I'm not saying that those are all related,
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.960]   but I do notice that there are at least correlations
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.000]   between when Joe says something
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.320]   when something bad happens in Joe's universe.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.320]   It's easier for me to believe that that's happening
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.520]   when it's happening around Joe himself.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.360]   - Yeah.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.540]   - But I'm worried about my friend.
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.560]   - Yeah.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.680]   - And I don't necessarily wanna push him
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:48.840]   towards being more if he doesn't want it
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.800]   because I don't think, I don't wanna conscript people.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.920]   He's got a great life, he's got a great situation,
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.240]   he's done a huge service.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.440]   Thank God, do you know,
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:01.800]   how much do I owe Joe just for what he's done for you
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.440]   to say nothing of what he's done for me
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.720]   or for Brett or for Sam or any of these people?
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:10.680]   And I'd like to think that we all try to give back,
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.920]   but I'm worried about Joe.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.120]   He's not worried.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.640]   - One of the inspiring things about Joe is,
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.560]   I mean, he's in this war alone
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.800]   and the way he fights the war is by just enjoying life.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.640]   - Well, that's his thing.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.120]   As long as he stays close to things that he loves
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.680]   and being, you know, one of the things,
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.760]   he's honest about his drug use.
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.760]   He loves to hunt.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.440]   So he's just, he does a certain amount
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.480]   of like semi-vice signaling up front.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.520]   And then you just also know him.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.640]   This is why every time they try to take him down,
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.840]   you use the N word, you know?
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.840]   It's like, unfortunately, everybody knows who Joe is
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.160]   and yes, he doesn't act as if he went
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.400]   to a fancy finishing school, right?
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.120]   That's not his energy.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.240]   The fact that you've got some super smart guy
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.200]   who always pretends to be a meathead,
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.640]   just like, you know, hey, I'm a comedian,
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   like all these defenses and disguises.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.000]   Okay, you've got this super smart guy
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.400]   who he's admitted to most of the things
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.000]   that you can take him down for
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.960]   and because everybody's been effectively
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.680]   in his den or his basement.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.040]   Think about that studio as his basement.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.960]   People have hung out with Joe so many hours
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.840]   that you can't tell them something about Joe
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.040]   where they're gonna say, wow, I'm gonna believe
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.680]   the New York Times and not the hundreds of hours
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.080]   I've spent on the Joe Rogan experience.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.240]   - But the cool thing is that, this is what inspires me,
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.960]   is that the way he's waging war against the system,
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.640]   it's just by being a good person
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.640]   and talking enough hours in a week
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.720]   where that message like bleeds throughout the words
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.960]   and the gaps between.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.880]   And that's so inspiring to me
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.000]   that the good people can win by just being good.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.160]   - And he's kind and he's tough and he also,
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.360]   he's no pushover.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.080]   - No.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.400]   - I always worry a little bit when I sit down in my chair.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.520]   - You still get scared that he'll call you
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.680]   on some kind of bullshit that you weren't even aware of?
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.160]   - No, the first time I was on the show,
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.440]   the energy wasn't great between us
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.520]   and it was in a sober October situation.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.120]   So I think I hadn't understood that
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.200]   and maybe our egos got a little bit off.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:25.480]   I don't know, I mean, I was having fun
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.680]   but maybe it was just too complicated life forms
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.600]   getting to know each other.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.720]   The first one was probably,
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.640]   yeah, it made me a little nervous for the future.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.520]   But then Joe and I become friends,
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.480]   although sometimes we have miscommunications.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:46.000]   Like on Yom Kippur, I texted him and I said,
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.120]   "Joe, I wanna apologize for ways I've let you down
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.920]   as a friend and haven't been there for you
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.760]   and appreciate everything you've done for me."
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.400]   Like I get this text back,
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.960]   what the fuck is your problem?
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.000]   (laughing)
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   You're great, dude.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.360]   I don't know what bad place you're in, but cheer up.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:05.560]   It's like, Joe, don't you have any Jews in your life?
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.640]   Apologize for what they've done.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.640]   He was just like, dude, have you lost your mind?
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.240]   What the hell's gotten into you?
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:17.720]   - Yeah, what do you think about the Spotify thing?
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:18.560]   - What about it?
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.400]   Ask me a question.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.160]   - He's now, as opposed to being just a comedian
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.880]   with a podcast, he now is just a comedian with a podcast
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:31.400]   who stepped in the middle of the center of cancel culture,
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.880]   which is like, I know Spotify is in Sweden,
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.120]   but they represent Silicon Valley.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:40.900]   They represent the very kind of structures
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.680]   they contain and represent the kind of structures
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:47.180]   that threaten to destroy the Elons of the world.
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:52.560]   And he just like stepped, like with his Alex Jones
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:57.560]   and his Joey Diaz, just strolled right into the middle of it.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.920]   - I think it's awesome.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:59.920]   I love it.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.440]   - But do you think he's strong enough to, I don't know.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.400]   I mean, I don't even know the right way to ask this,
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.960]   but is he strong enough to persevere?
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.040]   - It's a bit interesting.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.080]   It's like when a lion decides, wow,
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.520]   that honey badger looks tasty.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.280]   I'm gonna swallow it whole, see what happens.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.880]   - 'Cause I talked to him offline.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.320]   He really seems to be willing to give away the 100 million,
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.080]   which gives him so much power.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:27.040]   - Oh, I don't.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.400]   - It's a powerful thing to be able to say,
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:32.440]   I don't, yeah, to the honey badger.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.480]   He just strolls in, but he's willing to walk away
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.320]   from anything in this world.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.640]   - Well, he's gonna walk out the other side of the lion.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.800]   I don't think he's gonna go out the way he came in.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.640]   - Yeah.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.600]   - Well, you know what it is?
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.780]   It's Tommy Lee Jones entering the bug.
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:48.600]   - This is like a giant alien, he just walks into it?
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.800]   - He gets swallowed by the bug
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.060]   and he blasts out from the inside.
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:53.720]   I have it as Tommy Lee Jones.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.720]   - Yeah, but anyway, Joe Rogan to you.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.080]   - Yeah, is that my feeling is that Spotify
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.640]   doesn't understand what they're messing with.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.000]   I could be wrong, but I'm not.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:02.840]   - No, you're right.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:03.680]   - I'm right.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.080]   (laughing)
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.100]   Because Joe doesn't need anything, man.
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.800]   I mean, this is the weird thing about it.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.880]   It's like, I'm sure that he loves all his toys, whatever,
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.740]   blah, blah, blah, he's a rich guy.
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:14.200]   Yes, he's got FU money.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.720]   He had FU money a long time ago.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:21.260]   And you're not, you know, the other thing about,
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:23.720]   it's a bit weird being friends with a dude like that.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:26.240]   It just is, 'cause like, you call him up,
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.040]   or he'll call you up and he's like,
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:28.880]   what's going on in your life?
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.080]   And you're like, I don't know, kind of depressed,
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.520]   trying to get some math done, what are you up?
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.480]   Oh, dude, I can cheer you up, I just came off
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.620]   of a 29,000 person stadium.
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:40.880]   It's like, oh, cool, how'd you do that?
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.560]   Oh, I don't know, I just announced it on Instagram
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.600]   a few days ago and it filled up.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.940]   Just like, oh, damn.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.600]   - Yeah.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.420]   - I mean, that thing is powerful.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:50.260]   - So much love in that guy.
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:51.100]   - That thing is so powerful.
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:52.040]   - Yeah, so there you go.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.400]   I mean, you could be that too.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.460]   - The instant Joe takes an interest in politics
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.300]   and saving the world.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.800]   - You might destroy all of that.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.200]   - It's going bye-bye, I promise you.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.040]   - I just disagree with you.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.960]   I mean, 'cause you have to do it,
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.800]   like you've said this many times before.
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.760]   - I'll bet you, I'll bet you a bottle of Stoli
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:14.860]   that you can get, if you get Joe Rogan
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:17.640]   to get highly politically active and call out the system
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.960]   for all the bullshit that it is in a very pointed
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:24.760]   and determined fashion, and he doesn't get destroyed,
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.360]   I'll give you the vodka.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.200]   - The vodka?
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.020]   - Yeah.
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.440]   - That sounds like a pretty damn good deal.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.360]   So, but you've said this, I mean--
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.960]   - No living heroes, my friend.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.520]   No living heroes.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.360]   No living heroes.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.400]   - It's just difficult, you just have to be good at it.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.040]   I mean, if you just say generic political things--
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:45.880]   - No, no.
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:48.280]   - You're going to be taken down, but if you're--
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:52.620]   - The more heroic you are, the more beautiful you are,
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.880]   the more you will be made to suffer.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.640]   If they cannot get you on reputation,
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.580]   if Jesus himself came down, I don't know if I ever read,
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.700]   I probably have never read to you the hit piece
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.640]   I did on Jesus.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.480]   You don't know about this?
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.320]   - No, I do not know about this.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.900]   - I did hit pieces on all of the best people in the world.
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.060]   - Wow.
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:14.160]   - So whoever it was who cured cancer,
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.900]   discovered new particles, whatever it is,
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:18.640]   I did a hit piece against them to prove
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:22.720]   that I can do it to anybody around anything at any time.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.880]   - Except Eddie Van Halen is who we're talking about.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.620]   - Well, Eddie Van Halen is now dead,
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:30.120]   but if this was a situation, you know,
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:33.120]   hot for teacher, canceled.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.080]   - Disrespectful.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.300]   - Absolutely.
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:43.480]   Also, you know, packaging female objectification
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.040]   for young men, clearly Eddie Van Halen
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.680]   is one of the worst people alive.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.680]   - But the skill, the incredible inspiration
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.760]   that is just radiating from his music
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.100]   inspires so many millions that they will fight
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:00.080]   those canceled pieces, they will fight those.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.280]   - This is your thing.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.640]   You have this idea that there's a war between good and evil
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:07.000]   and the good has already been designated the winner.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.400]   And it's not true.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.560]   But your belief that it's true.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.100]   - Take it till you make it, no?
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.800]   I mean, you gotta--
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.600]   - It's motivating both of us.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.520]   Like I also believe that we're gonna win
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.240]   because if I don't, then I can't get out of bed
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.140]   and it's pretty heavy at the moment.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:27.140]   - Do you think 2021 can make us feel good
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:31.140]   about the trajectory of society?
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:36.060]   So like where we emerge from this year feeling good.
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.540]   Like there's a smile on Eric Kwanza's face
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.380]   and the next time we talk,
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.820]   we'll be doing some kind of duet on guitar
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.980]   and not having this worried look on our faces.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:48.460]   - No.
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:51.500]   - Okay, but you've also promised
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.860]   you're going to somehow end this in a positive.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.700]   A positive, so okay.
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.660]   So how do you turn the no around?
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.380]   What's the U-turn from the no?
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:03.100]   - Until we get some actually decent people
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:06.260]   in the right chairs who are not constantly thinking
[01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:09.400]   about their next paycheck, I don't see a solution.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:13.300]   Let me just say what the prerequisites for a solution are
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:15.800]   and to let you know why I don't think it's coming.
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:21.420]   First of all, both of these political parties,
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:24.620]   the leadership of them is disgusting and has to go.
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:26.660]   They're tearing us apart.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:28.940]   They lack the will to be Americans.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:32.220]   They don't understand the subtlety of the project.
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:34.100]   They're simply the people who figured out
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.620]   how to inhabit the seats
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:37.660]   and that is their great achievement.
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:43.820]   I believe that in order to solve this,
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:45.340]   you need people who can integrate,
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:47.540]   who are not partisan at the level
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:50.100]   of the partisan warriors that we're seeing.
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:52.600]   People who believe in dividing the pies of the future
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.380]   rather than the present pie as our main task as Americans
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:58.040]   because we are built around growth.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.100]   I'm sorry to say it.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:06.180]   You need an ability to have subtle conversations
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:08.020]   and you need the ability to exclude.
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:13.320]   And at the moment, everyone knows inclusion is good,
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.540]   which it isn't.
[01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:16.220]   It's like saying, well, water is good.
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:18.820]   If I say water is good, everybody will agree with me.
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.020]   It's not.
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:20.860]   People drown.
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:24.620]   People need to get dehydrated.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.780]   It can be life-saving or life-ending.
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:28.460]   It isn't good or bad.
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:30.340]   Inclusion is not good or bad.
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:31.740]   Inclusion is just inclusion.
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.660]   Exclusion is part of inclusion.
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:37.780]   We've taught people that they can reason through the world
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:43.960]   as sub-cocker Spaniels.
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.900]   They just bark things at each other.
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:48.540]   I'm for safety.
[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:49.780]   I'm for inclusion.
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:51.140]   I'm for growth.
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:52.540]   Oh, really?
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.180]   Do you guys use verbs?
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.660]   Dependent clauses?
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.340]   Are there compound complex sentences?
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:01.040]   Where are we in this sea of nonsense?
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.980]   You have to be able to build a place
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.460]   where you have smart, talented people
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:10.740]   who represent a diverse group of correct opinions.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:13.260]   You need to get rid of almost all of the people
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:15.260]   who have opinions that are antithetical
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:17.700]   to what we're trying to accomplish.
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:19.660]   You need to give them insulation,
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:21.860]   which we're terrified because we don't trust anybody,
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.340]   so everything has to be transparent.
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:24.340]   If you're going to the bathroom,
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:25.860]   I want those walls to be plexiglass
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.060]   so I can see what you're doing.
[01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:29.340]   It's like, that's too much transparency.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.500]   We have too much and not enough at the same time.
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:36.700]   And then, in essence, you need to ensure
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:39.260]   that people aren't worried about feeding their family
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.180]   every four seconds for being real.
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:43.580]   None of that is happening.
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:47.300]   And our billionaires, our billionaires are pathetic.
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:49.000]   What is the point of billionaires
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.020]   if you're not going to do billionaire-type cool stuff
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:56.340]   like saying, F you, and I'm going to throw
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:58.660]   three billion dollars at the project
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:02.780]   of restoring the national conversation?
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:06.780]   I don't grasp this.
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:09.100]   What is the point of creating obscene wealth
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:10.540]   if we don't have anyone smart enough
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:12.900]   and caring enough to use it?
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:16.140]   - So I agree with that last part for sure.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:20.480]   Let me slightly push back on the idea
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.840]   that the leaders themselves are broken.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:27.100]   I feel like, this goes to the Joe Rogan,
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:31.920]   Joe Biden and Trump having a debate on that program.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:36.920]   I feel like Joe Biden has a lot of really interesting ideas
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.640]   that he's almost forgot how to communicate.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.100]   He's been fake for so long within the system.
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.480]   - Hillary was fake for too long.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:47.440]   I'm sure she had real ideas at the beginning
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:50.560]   that she still was campaigning on decades later.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.120]   - But if the system, if the platforms
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.720]   empowered you to search, to be honest, to be real,
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.520]   to search for those ideas within yourself
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.560]   like long-form conversations do,
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.840]   then even the Donald Trump and Joe Biden leaders
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:10.600]   we have now would take this country to a better place
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.800]   that would unite people.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.440]   So we can keep the current Congress,
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.680]   we just need to create better platforms.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.040]   This is going to the intuition
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.360]   that there's good in Donald Trump.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.400]   There's depth and complexity and intelligence.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.200]   And the same with Joe Biden.
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.040]   - There's good in Joe Biden.
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.260]   - And it's just, we're not incentivizing.
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:34.960]   I mean, there's several things I think are broken.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.040]   One of them is Twitter, the other is journalism.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:41.440]   It's just the platforms of us communicating with each other.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.200]   - One of the reasons that I try to come up
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.760]   with unifying explanations is that,
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:49.600]   if you look at the number of wildfires in California,
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.880]   let's say, that we've just seen,
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:56.400]   if you treat them all as spontaneous, uncorrelated instances,
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.600]   it feels like, oh my God, it's just whack-a-mole.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.580]   Every time I send a fire truck here,
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:02.080]   there's a fire over there.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:06.040]   So you want to come up with something like a central theory,
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.840]   which is why do I suddenly have a problem
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:09.960]   when I hadn't had a problem before?
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.560]   So I look for these unifying explanations.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.480]   And I found one the other day that really speaks to me.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.200]   I mean, people are very frustrated
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.160]   because they've been trained to think about this
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.960]   incorrectly, in my opinion.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:25.160]   But here's the graph that you need to look at.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.560]   On the X-axis is time by year.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:35.640]   And on the Y-axis is something like average age of a human.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:38.480]   The title of the graph is
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:41.580]   Any Desirable Situation Involving Institutions.
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:46.140]   So that could be CEO.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:48.600]   It could be tenured professor.
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:53.500]   It could be who's getting grants.
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:57.380]   It could be the age at which people win Nobel Prizes.
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:04.260]   University presidents, all these things go up.
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:08.440]   In other words, for a long period of time,
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:12.420]   the average age of the person in a desirable situation
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:16.380]   has been increasing something like nine months for every 12.
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:22.060]   Those graphs have to go down at some point.
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:24.300]   The specter of-- - It's brilliantly put.
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:28.180]   - Of having five people all born in the 1940s
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:33.180]   as the final entrance in the presidential context.
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:36.300]   That makes no sense.
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.540]   Think about how bizarre a thing
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.440]   that nobody's even really talking about.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:44.600]   The last five people were all ancient
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:47.060]   by presidential standards.
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:49.620]   Not one, not two, but five.
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:54.040]   We are talking about a contest between somebody
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.540]   who is the oldest of the baby boomers,
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:01.200]   the very beginning of the baby boom, summer of '46 birthday,
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:05.060]   fighting somebody who is in the silent generation.
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:08.800]   The silent generation guy at a town hall in Florida
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:11.480]   gets this question from a Gen Z guy saying,
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:14.080]   what's going on with my future?
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:18.200]   Joe Biden has the audacity to say,
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.000]   I'm a transitional president.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.960]   You guys are the highly educated one.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:25.180]   When has any generation in history
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:29.400]   needed a transitional 78-year-old person to take office?
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.280]   It's bizarre, it's preposterous.
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:35.180]   That graph is the graph we can't talk about.
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:38.340]   That graph is the graph of our destruction.
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:44.580]   Because it has the, you can make a one-line argument,
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:46.820]   which is, sounds like ageism,
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:50.380]   which isn't a very good argument.
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:54.600]   No, but what it does is it muddles the conversation.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.680]   And you always have to ask yourself the question,
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.700]   if this conversation becomes muddled,
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:00.660]   who wins as a result of the muddling?
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:04.160]   - Well, it's a battle, but let's just win it.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:05.440]   Let's win the battle.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.440]   You give-- - Are you running?
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.360]   - For sure, I'll run.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.160]   I was born in Russia, can't run.
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:13.880]   So, but we Russians can hack elections,
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.640]   so we'll figure it out.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.640]   This is me officially announcing my run for president.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:20.520]   - I was born in St. Petersburg, Florida.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.120]   (laughing)
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:23.960]   - Yeah.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.840]   - Lex, what is it that you really wanna ask?
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:30.040]   - I think, I wanna put some responsibility on the portal.
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.740]   - On the portal. - The portal.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:37.740]   That the portal gives power to the people in that graph.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:41.140]   'Cause you put it quite brilliantly
[01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:44.700]   that the people that move the world,
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:46.220]   their age has been going up.
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:49.780]   And not move the world, but put in the position
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:52.160]   where they get the chance to affect the world.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:57.780]   These new platforms, I think Twitter falls in them,
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:00.260]   give power to the younger people.
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:01.980]   It doesn't have to be about age necessarily,
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:04.140]   but the younger thinking people.
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:06.740]   So, that's a promising thing.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:09.220]   And you are like, you're like Gandalf.
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:11.920]   You get to pick your Frodo's, or whatever.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.180]   I'm not very good with the analogy,
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:16.220]   but the whole point is for you as Gandalf--
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:18.120]   - I don't know that I make that much sense.
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:20.060]   Gandalf makes sense.
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:22.360]   I don't know if people know how to fit me
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.080]   into this ecosystem.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.460]   I think there's something in my presentation
[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:27.700]   that people find very confusing.
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:28.540]   - No, figure it out.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.900]   I disagree with you, but you need to look at the mirror
[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:32.940]   and think like, what is it?
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:36.940]   Maybe you need a mustache, I don't know.
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.480]   (laughing)
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:41.920]   But there's something about figuring out
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.780]   how to be a charismatic communicator in this.
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:45.260]   And that's the responsibility.
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:48.660]   You said like finishing sentences with the LOL
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:50.100]   is painful for your soul.
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:52.180]   - Yeah, that's just how somebody lets me know
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:54.580]   I don't have to take their opinion seriously.
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.820]   - Yeah, it's still the language,
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:58.380]   the way that people are communicating.
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:33:59.500]   And you're swimming that wave.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.540]   You have a big platform.
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:02.700]   I have a growing platform.
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:05.300]   It feels like this is the place to give power.
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:07.480]   - I agree, but we're gonna get swatted down.
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.560]   - I just don't think so.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.400]   - You're wrong.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.260]   - Why are you afraid of the big, like this is--
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.140]   - 'Cause I've studied it.
[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:17.200]   Because I've studied, let me ask you a question, Lex.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:21.860]   I believe that every society is supposed to have
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:25.540]   a collection of what I call break glass
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.160]   in case of emergency people.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.580]   - Yeah.
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.580]   - These are people who are universally loved
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:33.100]   and trusted by your society.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.540]   For example, David Attenborough,
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:39.300]   the great British naturalist and presenter,
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:40.700]   recently came on Instagram.
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:42.160]   He's worried about the planet.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.580]   And I said, look, there are very few of these people left.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.420]   Let's pay attention, find out what he has to say.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:49.700]   Maybe he's gonna be an ass.
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:50.540]   Maybe he's gonna be an idiot.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:51.540]   Maybe he's gonna say wrong things.
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:52.660]   Don't know.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:56.420]   Tell me about your top 10 universal American heroes.
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:58.900]   - This is not a rhetorical question.
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:00.460]   - No.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:02.020]   Give me five.
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:03.900]   Everybody looks to that person and says,
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:05.640]   yep, the best of us.
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:07.820]   - Well, not divisive.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:11.500]   Well, everybody's an interesting concept.
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:15.100]   I mean, Elon Musk is very divisive, right?
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.940]   - I'm talking about overwhelmingly people
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:20.580]   would follow that person if that person gave
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:24.380]   a rousing, intelligent speech that said,
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:27.380]   we must act now because we're in dire straits.
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:30.020]   - I think a lot of people fall in that category.
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.940]   For me, it would be in the tech world,
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:34.780]   in the engineering world.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:35.620]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:36.440]   Tell me names.
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.280]   - Elon Musk.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.120]   - Elon Musk.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:42.040]   - The Rock.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:45.860]   I'm thinking like, who is the most eloquent actor?
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:47.300]   So like, you think celebrities.
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:48.140]   So people with platforms.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:48.980]   - I didn't say celebrities.
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:50.140]   - No, but-- - You have to be well known.
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:55.140]   - I believe like, yeah, so this goes to Joe Rogan.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:36:02.140]   - First two did not really impress me
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:03.880]   as being what I said, but okay.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:08.260]   Elon several years ago would have.
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:10.340]   - Can you try to--
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:11.180]   - Joe Rogan--
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:12.340]   - Why do they fail?
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:13.420]   Why is Elon--
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:16.060]   - Lots of people treat Joe Rogan as if he's
[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:18.060]   some sort of right-wing racist because
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:19.680]   they've never watched his program.
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:20.700]   They don't know who his friends are.
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:22.060]   I don't know.
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.860]   - Oh, but when I thought you said everybody,
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:29.220]   I thought you meant a large enough people
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:31.160]   where a huge change can happen,
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.620]   not actually literally everybody.
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.460]   Because I think--
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.700]   - I mean people who've pulled off,
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:38.580]   like people who've pulled off something
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:41.760]   where everybody's convinced that that person just deeply,
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:47.060]   I mean, I think I've told you this story before,
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:52.060]   but the one time I've seen the power of a figure like this,
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:56.360]   I mean, very few times I've been in a large crowd
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.320]   and I've seen people just moved where they would do
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.120]   almost anything good, bad, and different
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.000]   because they were primed.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.440]   One was a Rolling Stones concert.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.880]   The other one was Nelson Mandela coming to Boston.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.760]   And man, you've never seen anything like this.
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.320]   You check out the photos from the banks
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.080]   of the Charles River when Nelson Mandela came.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:24.760]   There are people that you need in your dark hours
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:26.120]   and we can't agree on who they are.
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.400]   And as soon as they emerge, we tar them with shit.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.420]   We get out the shit brush.
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:32.560]   - Yeah, I just disagree with you.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:33.960]   So I think--
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.720]   - What do we disagree about here?
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:37.560]   - I think it doesn't matter who it is.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:40.600]   I think really good speeches are needed.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.440]   And I think a lot--
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.620]   - Great, who's gonna give them?
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:44.360]   I saw Killer Mike try to give a good speech.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.200]   - Yeah, he did.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.000]   - In Atlanta, right?
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:47.840]   - Yeah, he did.
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.360]   - That was something.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.040]   Very impressed.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:54.860]   Even Killer Mike immediately gets into this, sell out!
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:38:01.200]   - Yeah, but he didn't take up the responsibility,
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.160]   I would say--
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.000]   - He didn't.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.860]   - Of going bigger.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:07.760]   So he was speaking to the community.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.960]   - He was doing what he--
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.280]   - On this particular moment, he's exceptional at it.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.680]   And he was speaking to this particular moment.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:16.240]   He didn't take it a step farther,
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:21.240]   which is like giving the same speech,
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:23.200]   but bigger than race.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.880]   Bigger than this particular moment,
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.400]   but more about the American project.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.640]   - You know the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson?
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:33.160]   - Yes, yeah, there you go.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.480]   That's a good example.
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:37.340]   - That guy, until we screw him up,
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:40.240]   is the kind of thing that I'm talking about.
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.080]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.700]   I mean, Jocko, maybe.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:43.560]   - That's another--
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.640]   - Jocko's pretty good.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:47.740]   Jocko is pretty good.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:49.880]   Can't really tell, is he a Democrat, is he a Republican?
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:50.720]   I don't know.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.080]   He's an American, that's for damn sure.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:54.160]   - Yeah, and I think there's a lot of folks--
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:57.400]   - And then, no, I think Jocko, there aren't.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.400]   That's one of the reasons why Jocko's so important.
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.740]   - That's so important, yeah.
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:04.480]   Your podcast, The Portal, is something,
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.840]   in my little universe,
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.880]   is something a lot of people really love.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:11.240]   And it moves them.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.020]   They draw a lot of meaning from it.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:16.880]   And also, especially in difficult times.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:22.760]   It gives them a comfort of,
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.000]   through this kind of, it's not just nuance.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.940]   There's like, even when you're talking about chaos,
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:31.780]   there's love underneath all of it.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.800]   And I think people draw a lot of meaning from it,
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:38.800]   which is why they are wondering why you haven't been doing
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.800]   that many podcasts, or you haven't done it in maybe
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:46.220]   a month and a half or two months,
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:49.380]   in this most difficult of times.
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:50.960]   Is there a good reason?
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.060]   - Yeah, there are lots of good reasons.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.620]   So the first one is kind of weird,
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:01.620]   which is everybody assumes that everyone wants to be famous.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:05.880]   And if you say, I don't wanna be famous,
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:06.960]   it's like, oh, you're just saying that
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:09.120]   because you want everyone to think you're famous.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:09.960]   You're not that famous!
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:10.800]   You know, okay.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:16.820]   I don't love being as well-known as I've become.
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:21.440]   There's lots of things that are fun about it.
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:24.440]   It's wonderful that you can go to any city in the world,
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.240]   and there are Portal listeners there.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.840]   All I need to do is put out a tweet,
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:30.800]   and 20 people show up for a drink.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:31.800]   - And they're amazing people.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:36.280]   - And they're almost, I mean, you can see my live Q&As
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.480]   on my Instagram page.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:38.840]   If you go to Eric R. Weinstein,
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.480]   I just pick somebody randomly,
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.080]   and I was really worried about it at first.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.600]   And maybe I should be worried about it,
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.920]   but in general, people all over the world
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.180]   are just so positive.
[01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:53.600]   - And thoughtful, and deep, and they have a story.
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.640]   - 'Cause they're self-selected, right?
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.120]   But I don't like the fame.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:00.240]   - The thing we just described comes with the fame.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:01.400]   It's a beautiful thing.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.720]   You're worried that it's getting--
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.560]   - It's ephemeral.
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:09.240]   Look, Lex, it'll turn on you in a heartbeat.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.120]   - Yeah.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.760]   - It'll turn on you in a heartbeat.
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:15.480]   And the other problem is I don't like my audience
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.960]   being my audience.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.080]   I wanna get closer to them.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:18.960]   I wanna talk to them.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.040]   I wanna find out what is this doing in your life?
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:24.720]   My house fills up with art that people send me.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:27.380]   The latest thing is an effects pedal,
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:28.220]   called something like, I don't know,
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:31.720]   it's a Bowtie Overdrive from a guy in Mexico.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:32.760]   (laughing)
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.000]   Right? - Yeah.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.120]   - You play electric, by the way,
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.960]   in a tiny little tangent?
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:37.920]   You play electric?
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.840]   - I have a Stratocaster.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.000]   But it doesn't have a strap,
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.040]   and I don't know what to do with it,
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.000]   and I have a bad amp.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.840]   So you should hook me up with--
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:48.280]   - We'll find it a home, maybe.
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.280]   - Okay.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.200]   - You're starting to sense that this is too much?
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.680]   - No, I wanna be here.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.960]   I wanna do the work.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.840]   Very simply.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.720]   I don't have an ability to fully explain myself.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.680]   I don't wanna claim that I don't love the fact that,
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:09.240]   how much love do we get for these programs?
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:14.160]   Generically, people are incredibly generous.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:19.040]   People have begged me, set up a Patreon account.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.000]   And I haven't been able to do it.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.040]   I should do it.
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:24.360]   I've said to everybody, it's a business,
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.440]   it's a business, it's a business.
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.960]   But they're so used to being defrauded
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.400]   when somebody starts thinking about monetary incentives.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.520]   My goal was to say, I'm gonna keep talking to you about,
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.760]   you wanna know why I started doing ads on my show?
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:40.480]   Was because I wanted people to think from the get-go,
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.440]   this is a business,
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:43.600]   this is what I sound like when I'm selling.
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:47.800]   But you know, like you see, I've lost weight.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:51.080]   A lot of that is due to Athletic Greens.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:52.000]   - Athletic Greens.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.720]   Code, what's the--
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:59.760]   - I don't know what my promo code is for Athletic Greens.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.840]   - Probably athleticgreens.com/portal.
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.560]   But it doesn't matter. - It's a slash portal.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.880]   - But Fitbit, who doesn't advertise,
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:07.720]   has also been instrumental,
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:10.000]   as well as a guy named Steven Cates,
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.360]   who was a fan from the show,
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:13.520]   found me on the street and just said,
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.120]   "I'm a trainer, I wanna help train you."
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.320]   And it's got me on a good path.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:20.840]   So that's one paid advertiser
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.920]   and two people that I'm calling out
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.480]   just because two outfits,
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:28.720]   Steven Cates and Fitbit, that have changed my life.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.200]   I wanted people to say,
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:31.960]   you don't have to be afraid of advertising.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:36.240]   If I do it in this way, this is powering your show.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.960]   But the whole issue of money is weird
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.960]   because people have these crazy feelings like,
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.160]   "Oh wow, I knew he was a shill.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.960]   He's a grifter."
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.920]   I didn't love that.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.080]   I didn't love the issue.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:50.420]   So I didn't set up a Patreon.
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:55.420]   The security issues for talking and being me are significant.
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:44:00.980]   And I don't have the kind of money to hire around the clock.
[01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:05.020]   I mean, I desperately want to get to a level of wealth
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.180]   where I don't have to think about money.
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:08.220]   I don't think it's, you know,
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:12.300]   some people want money because they need it for status.
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:15.380]   I think I can handle status if I want it doing this.
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.420]   I don't want the status necessarily.
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:21.380]   And I don't want, I'd want the status,
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:23.580]   but I don't want the fame that goes with it.
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:25.540]   I want the money.
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:28.460]   I don't want to be seen as this is about money
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:30.020]   'cause it's about a substance.
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:34.860]   All of those things, that's part of,
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:36.740]   I haven't solved these issues.
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:39.340]   I've been feeling bad because people say,
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:40.260]   "Where's the portal?
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:41.100]   We're desperate.
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:41.920]   These are difficult times.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.260]   We have an election coming up."
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:46.340]   And it's just like, do you think for a moment
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:48.220]   that I want to explain that I actually got
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:50.500]   really uncomfortable being as well-known as I was?
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:51.660]   And then what is it that I want?
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:53.520]   Because I want to be better known
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.460]   and less well-known at the same time.
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:56.980]   There's nothing the audience can do.
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:58.420]   I don't want the audience to be the audience.
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:44:59.780]   That doesn't make sense to people.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:01.420]   I want it to be a business,
[01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:03.360]   but I don't think people need to fear a business
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:06.060]   if the business is open about being a business.
[01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:09.120]   That, and then that's all to the side.
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.460]   What you're seeing now in front of the election
[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:15.580]   is an incredibly meta-violent period
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:17.200]   in our online existence.
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:22.260]   And I believe that anybody who attempts to say
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:25.100]   these two parties are completely screwed
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.220]   at the moment the leadership of these parties
[01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:29.400]   is unsalvageable, unworkable,
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.300]   everyone hears that from inside the two-party system.
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:35.020]   Oh, I get it.
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:36.860]   He's trying to subtract votes off of Biden.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:37.680]   Oh, I get it.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:39.360]   He's trying to scuttle Trump.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:40.300]   Oh, I get it.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:41.580]   This is a play for his show
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:44.200]   because he's trying to plug in to discuss.
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.780]   There's a Bill Hicks routine on marketing.
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:48.500]   Have you ever seen this?
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:49.320]   Brilliant.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:50.780]   I recommend it to everyone,
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:53.460]   where he comes out on stage and he says,
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:56.260]   "Are there any people in marketing and sales in the audience?"
[01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:57.100]   Woo, yeah.
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:59.300]   It's like, okay, great.
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:01.380]   Can you do us all a favor and die?
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:02.660]   And like everybody laughs.
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:04.240]   He's like, no, I'm not laughing.
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:05.260]   I'm being serious.
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:07.400]   So he talks about how marketing is horrible.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.400]   So you're like, where's this act going?
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:11.260]   Then he gets to the point of it.
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:13.860]   It's like, oh, I know how you marketing people think.
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:17.620]   Bill's going after that resentment dollar.
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:18.660]   That's a good dollar.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.980]   Let's get that resentment anti-marketing dollar.
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:21.900]   It's like, no, that's not what I'm saying.
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:23.260]   I really hate marketers.
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:24.080]   Oh, that's good.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:25.340]   It's the authenticity dollar.
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:26.540]   (laughing)
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:31.540]   You can't escape this kind of negative marketing thought.
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:34.620]   And I guess that gets to the issue
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:38.400]   that I don't want to be destroyed
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.060]   in advance of this election.
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:43.020]   I don't think it's a good use
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:45.060]   of my relationship to my audience
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:48.980]   to be broadcasting how completely ridiculous
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:51.540]   Donald Trump and Joe Biden are as candidates
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:54.180]   for the President of the United States, full stop.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:55.680]   None of this makes any sense.
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:58.460]   These moderators of these pseudo debates
[01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:01.560]   were in the wrong format with the wrong people.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:04.480]   No part of this makes a whit of sense.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:08.860]   - Can I try to push back several claims?
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:13.860]   One is I don't believe the systems as they stand now
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:20.540]   can destroy their equine Stein voice, the voice.
[01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:22.020]   - You're a child.
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.420]   I'm sorry to say that.
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:26.340]   - But, well, let me, well, it's also possible.
[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:27.180]   - Let's fight.
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:31.060]   - It's entirely possible that you're the child, okay?
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:32.660]   Because a child would say,
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:34.460]   you would call other people a child.
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.860]   - Yeah, get in the first blow.
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:37.820]   (laughing)
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:39.180]   It's a big reveal to tell.
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:43.180]   - Because the only power they have
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:44.900]   is to attack you psychologically.
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:45.900]   - No.
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:50.100]   - Well, I believe that the army of people
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:55.100]   that love you is much more powerful than mainstream media,
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:48:00.140]   than people that you might hear say ridiculous things
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:02.380]   that you just said, which is try to reduce you,
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:06.980]   like the marketing, thinking.
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:09.260]   I just believe there's an army,
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:10.820]   maybe there's a better term,
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:15.520]   of people that see you for who you are and are hungry.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:18.220]   - I'm not disputing those things.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.540]   That's not what I'm saying.
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:22.740]   I would venture to say, as your therapist,
[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:25.140]   that you're actually,
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:30.140]   the battle is all in your mind,
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:34.260]   that you have found these demons in the system,
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:38.180]   and they're just a tiny minority,
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:39.420]   and it's all in your mind.
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:43.100]   They cannot actually remove,
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:47.060]   they're not strong enough to remove the voice
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:49.060]   of Eric Weinstein, to silence the voice.
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:50.520]   - I love this.
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.840]   This is some of the best fiction writing I've ever heard.
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:59.060]   Let me tell you, I have relatives
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:01.540]   who've known me my entire life,
[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:03.740]   where one article in the New York Times,
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:05.860]   they will believe that over me.
[01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:09.780]   - My contention is that it has no power
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:11.380]   except to affect your psychology.
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:12.300]   - You're not hearing me. - What you have to do
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:14.020]   is the Rogan thing, which is laugh.
[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:14.860]   - You're not hearing me.
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:16.020]   - Just laugh.
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:16.940]   - I am laughing.
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:18.140]   - I know, but more.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:20.180]   I'm telling you something.
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:21.220]   - Yes.
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:23.920]   - The way this works is through ruin.
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:27.540]   Ruin can come to anyone.
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:29.700]   There's no one who cannot be ruined.
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:34.460]   Every single person is signed up right now
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:36.860]   to be ruined by the system.
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:39.900]   - Don't you understand that you have more power
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:41.340]   than the system?
[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:43.500]   You can ruin the system.
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:45.940]   Your Twitter account, the podcast,
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:47.900]   that's what I'm telling you about the army.
[01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:50.100]   - I agree that my Twitter account, my podcast,
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:52.300]   but what we've seen, for example,
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:55.600]   you saw what happened to Brett's articles of Unity Project?
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.440]   - Yes.
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:57.260]   - Okay, what happened?
[01:49:57.260 --> 01:49:59.220]   - You mean on the Twitter side?
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:01.060]   - On the Twitter side, what happened?
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:03.560]   What happened?
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:04.380]   - Well, actually, it's not a good answer.
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:05.500]   - Say the words, say the words.
[01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:07.780]   - It was blocked or removed from Twitter.
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:09.580]   - Suspended, account suspended.
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:15.260]   Okay, I have a direct line to Jack.
[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:17.060]   Okay, so I'm talking to the CEO
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:21.660]   who I am crazy enough to still believe in.
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:22.640]   - Good, I do too.
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:23.480]   - I believe it.
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:25.400]   Somehow, there's a very strange thing
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.300]   going on with Jack Dorsey.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:30.260]   I cannot possibly reconcile the actions
[01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:35.260]   with the person I've, that is a next level mind in there.
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:38.620]   I don't know it well enough to say
[01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:39.920]   that it's all next level.
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:41.980]   I'm not claiming he doesn't have any blind spots.
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:43.940]   Every smart person I know has blind spots.
[01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:46.720]   I don't know what he's up against, blah, blah, blah.
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:50.020]   There's no way that the Jack Dorsey that I've talked to
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:53.620]   and the Jack Dorsey that interacted over articles of unity
[01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:55.540]   can be the same person.
[01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:58.020]   He is constrained by that company in some way
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:50:59.460]   that doesn't make sense to me.
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:01.700]   Either that or he's the most duplicitous person on earth
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:02.700]   and I'm not believing it.
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:04.140]   I just don't buy it, okay?
[01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:07.480]   Something horrible is happening.
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:13.740]   My claim is I can remove you functionally
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:17.420]   from the chess board in a tiny number of moves.
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:19.600]   No matter who you are, no matter how virtuous
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:22.580]   or how much of a bastard you've been your entire life,
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:25.100]   it doesn't take more than three or four moves
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:27.960]   to basically neuter you as a force.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:31.040]   - Yeah, and I disagree that if that's possible,
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:33.000]   that means I'm not very good at chess.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.200]   Like, Unity 2020 was removed from Twitter
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:38.280]   because it's not good enough.
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:39.880]   Not within the system.
[01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:45.220]   The army of people that feel the brilliance of the idea
[01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:46.820]   was too small.
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:49.980]   - But fear, uncertainty, and doubt is the name of the game,
[01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:51.140]   the coin of the realm.
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:53.780]   - Psychology, though, it's not real power.
[01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:55.260]   It just affects the mind.
[01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:57.420]   - Okay, I have a reading assignment for you.
[01:51:57.420 --> 01:51:59.860]   Because you're Russian, you'll really enjoy this.
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:04.060]   As part of the great American tobacco settlement,
[01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:07.740]   the Tobacco Institute had to disgorge its archives
[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:11.080]   of all of its strategies, all of its skullduggery,
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:13.200]   and put it on the web for all time
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.640]   so that we could all understand
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:17.560]   how the tobacco companies got together
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.040]   and destroyed people, right?
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:22.600]   You see, tobacco destroys people.
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:26.240]   You can see, Scientology destroys people.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:31.000]   There are various vindictive organizations
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:36.000]   that will not tolerate reality in opposition to them.
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:38.520]   - Let's take him down.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:39.360]   - Okay.
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.440]   - That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:41.480]   - Okay, no.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.880]   - So why aren't you doing the podcast, The Return,
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:47.040]   because that's one of the weapons of war.
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:52.200]   - Well, first of all, if you're at war,
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:57.200]   I don't want to discuss strategy on a podcast, right?
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.720]   - But you're misunderstanding.
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:00.880]   - What did Montgomery say about Rommel?
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:06.160]   Wasn't his line, "I read your book, you beautiful bastard"?
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:07.560]   It's like, why are you using the tactics
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:09.600]   that you already explained?
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:11.400]   Okay, so one of the things I'm doing
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:13.680]   is I'm not having a strategic conversation
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:17.420]   with you and several hundred thousand of our closest friends.
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:25.320]   I pulled back because this is not the battle
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:28.600]   that I know what I'm doing.
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:30.680]   I do not feel passionately enough
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:33.640]   about defeating Donald Trump to elect Joe Biden,
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:38.160]   even if that's the way I'm gonna ultimately vote, right?
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:42.600]   I don't believe in the Biden Democratic Party.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.380]   I don't believe in the Trump Republican Party.
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:48.520]   So yes, it's an incredibly consequential election,
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:51.540]   but to me, it's like the Crips and the Bloods
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:54.200]   and the Latin Kings fighting over the right
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:57.760]   to extort a business and the business trying to figure out
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:00.520]   who it wants to do the extorting.
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:02.360]   - But don't you think, listen,
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:03.880]   there's very few people that are as good
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:05.800]   with the English language as you.
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:08.960]   Don't you think it's possible to draw a line
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:11.920]   that doesn't, in between,
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:16.500]   that finds how we find our common humanity
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:20.880]   that ensures a better 2021 without having to say,
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:24.960]   like, Donald Trump is evil or Joe Biden is incompetent
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:28.000]   or any of that, just somehow draw a beautiful line.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.600]   - I am seeing people in so much pain.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:33.400]   This election is chewing up the integrity
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:35.980]   of everyone who comments on it, Lex.
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:38.360]   - Maybe they're not good enough.
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:39.200]   - They're not good enough.
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:41.160]   No, but that, okay.
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:42.880]   Do you believe in me?
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:44.080]   - Yes. - You do?
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:44.920]   - Yes. - All right,
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:46.760]   listen to me very carefully.
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:50.520]   My spider sense, my intuition that has allowed me
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:51.800]   to survive in this space,
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:54.500]   I've been mouthing off since the '80s,
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:59.480]   tells me this is a super dangerous time
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:03.280]   for smart people to be spending the dry powder
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:05.800]   because the election doesn't make sense.
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:08.360]   Doesn't mean that I don't have a sense
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:11.400]   that one outcome would be better than the other, probably,
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:12.880]   but the variance on that,
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.740]   I'm not even positive that I'm right.
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:20.000]   These two options are so completely inappropriate
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.220]   to the world of 2020.
[01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:25.000]   What we need is so diametrically opposed
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.840]   to more boomers and more silent generation people
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:32.040]   trying to sort out a highly technical world
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:34.480]   being mediated through social media.
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:37.760]   We need more exclusion.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.920]   We need more actual elites.
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:42.400]   The people we've called the elites are not the elite.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.040]   They need to go.
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.880]   - Yeah, we need excellence, competence.
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:49.020]   - We need people who can be trusted behind closed doors,
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:50.600]   and we need to close the doors
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:52.800]   so we can't see what those people are doing.
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:55.800]   Here's the thing.
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:57.180]   Imagine that you had a bunch of people
[01:55:57.180 --> 01:56:00.700]   who'd all seen action in combat,
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:03.560]   had all volunteered to be part of the armed services,
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:06.120]   had all come from backgrounds where they didn't need to.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:08.000]   So you were convinced that these people
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.760]   had put their lives on the line for their country,
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:12.320]   not for a payday.
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:14.320]   Imagine you had 10 of these people
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:15.880]   with technical backgrounds,
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:18.720]   men, women, black, white, Muslim, Jew, doesn't matter.
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:26.500]   I would trust those people, and I'd close the door.
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.280]   I don't wanna know what they talked about.
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:33.500]   I don't want transparency into all of their negotiations.
[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:35.220]   I wanna know that they're patriotic,
[01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:36.800]   that they see something in the world
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:39.200]   bigger than themselves and their family fortunes.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.480]   I wanna know that they're courageous.
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:45.520]   I wanna know that they've got all of our well-being,
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.900]   and I'm willing to roll the dice,
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:50.320]   and if they screw us over, I'd rather go down like that.
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.120]   - Okay, so I disagree with you there,
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:55.000]   'cause there's a difference between those and Jocko,
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.000]   because you're not speaking to people with credentials.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.980]   - No, I'm talking about self-credentialed people.
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:02.820]   - Self-credentialed.
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:04.540]   - I view Jocko as self-credentialed.
[01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:06.820]   - But the biggest, the powerful thing about Jocko
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:08.380]   is he's not only self-credentialed,
[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:11.780]   but he's been real with people.
[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:15.320]   The magical thing about Jocko isn't his book,
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:16.620]   isn't his life story,
[01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:19.580]   is he's been talking on a podcast for a long,
[01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:21.900]   there's something real that happens.
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:23.900]   - Okay, so if you took--
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:24.740]   - Everybody, yeah.
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:27.700]   - If you took Dan Crenshaw and Tulsi Gabbard,
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:30.620]   and you took Jocko Willing and maybe Jesse Ventura,
[01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:33.340]   you can take--
[01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:34.540]   - I see where you're going with this.
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:38.820]   - What, you can take Bernie Sanders, who's a lone voice,
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:43.120]   you take all of these people who've really just risked,
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:46.300]   like why do we trust, why is Katharine Hepburn
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:48.900]   the best that Hollywood ever produced?
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:51.100]   'Cause she told Hollywood to go fuck itself.
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:54.260]   Hard.
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:56.460]   They gave her four Academy Awards,
[01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:58.180]   and she said, "Love you, sweeties,
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:57:59.580]   "I'm gonna use them as the doorstops
[01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:01.540]   "for the bathrooms in my house."
[01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:02.540]   - See, that's skill.
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:05.820]   - That's what you were talking about.
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:07.120]   Be Katharine Hepburn.
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.820]   Audrey Hepburn is pretty amazing,
[01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:12.220]   but Katharine Hepburn is next level, right?
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:15.020]   That's what you're trying to say to me.
[01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:16.860]   Okay, I'm trying to figure it out, Lex.
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:18.700]   I don't have the answer yet.
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:22.100]   What I do know is that this election is chewing people up,
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:23.540]   and I mean two separate things.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:25.940]   One, that parties don't have enough integrity,
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:28.980]   that if you comment either for or against,
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:32.300]   there's a short sequence where you make a comment
[01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:36.900]   that's nuanced, you get referenced to something, right?
[01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:38.900]   Like, you know, take this thing about, you know,
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:40.560]   fine people on both sides.
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:44.420]   That is non-resolved after N years,
[01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:49.020]   whether the context should be reported or not.
[01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:53.060]   We are in some situation in which Democrats and Republicans
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:56.720]   are primed to fight each other the way introducing two ants
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:59.700]   from two different ant colonies always produces a battle.
[01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:01.200]   - Yeah. - Okay?
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:04.260]   I don't want to be in that fray
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:06.580]   because those people are gonna kill each other
[01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:08.840]   mindlessly like robots.
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:10.880]   And until the election is concluded,
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:13.760]   like, do I think this is dire?
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:14.600]   Yes.
[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:15.420]   Could it be make or break?
[01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:16.260]   Absolutely.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:17.100]   I'm not saying that.
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:18.180]   Do I know which way this goes?
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:19.660]   I can make an excellent argument
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:22.380]   that we need to elect Joe Biden right now.
[01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:25.020]   We've got a situation which can only be cured
[01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:26.900]   by voting for Joe Biden.
[01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:29.420]   I can make another argument that we could have a situation
[01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:33.500]   that can only be cured by defeating Joe Biden right now
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:34.780]   and all of the things
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:37.300]   that the modern Democratic Party represents.
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:38.860]   - Yeah.
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:43.860]   - I don't have, you know, it's not the lady and the tiger.
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:45.900]   We're choosing between the tiger and the tiger.
[01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:49.100]   It's the Sumatran tiger versus the Siberian tiger.
[01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:51.180]   Right, I'm trying to think, well, which tiger can I,
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:52.880]   do I have a better chance against?
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:56.220]   The key problem for us politically
[01:59:56.220 --> 02:00:00.460]   is that we have to divorce the concept of the center
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:02.940]   and moderation from kleptocracy.
[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:05.980]   Every time we try to say something like,
[02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:07.780]   we need more moderate solutions,
[02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:09.860]   we need more pluralistic solutions,
[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:12.320]   people will say, wow, you just want to hand us
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:14.420]   right back into the swamp, don't you?
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:16.380]   Those swamp people, 'cause the moderates
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:18.420]   and the swamp people are the same people.
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:23.140]   Right, so then we have these two crazy wings.
[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:25.340]   We can't have crazy right-wing people.
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:27.820]   I don't want any tiki torch BS.
[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:30.820]   We can't have crazy left-wing, don't attack my courthouse.
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:33.400]   Really don't attack my courthouse.
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:35.420]   And we can't have moderates.
[02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:37.220]   It's like, okay, how do we install our children
[02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:39.840]   and rape, pillage, and get these speaking fees
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:42.300]   when we're out of office and become, you know,
[02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:44.980]   cozy with the things when we're supposed
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:48.900]   to be regulating them and then become their lobbyists
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:51.680]   immediately when we leave office, all of this stuff.
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:53.900]   We need an entirely different system.
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:56.220]   And I can't talk about that at the moment.
[02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:59.140]   When I talk, people say, oh, wow,
[02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:01.060]   so you're gonna sit this one out 'cause you're a pussy,
[02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:02.540]   'cause you're a coward?
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:04.260]   Great to know, Eric, we thought better of you.
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:05.180]   Bye, click.
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:07.380]   I don't know what to do.
[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:10.240]   - But are you thinking of what to do?
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:11.080]   - Yeah.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:13.780]   - You better believe it.
[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:16.940]   Look, Brett had this idea of Unity 2020,
[02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:18.700]   and I told him it was a wrong idea.
[02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:23.180]   I didn't tell him that Unity 2024 was a wrong idea.
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:25.740]   I didn't tell him that Unity 2028 is a wrong idea.
[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:27.880]   And if I were to make the case that he was right
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:30.840]   and I was wrong, 'cause he's now shuttered the thing, right?
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:35.100]   I would say that the case to be made that he was correct
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:37.140]   was is that by doing this in 2020,
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:39.400]   we found out what we were up against.
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:41.900]   It's good to know that Twitter can turn this off
[02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:43.620]   at the drop of a hat.
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:45.060]   Great to know.
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:46.860]   It's good to know, as we learned,
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:51.860]   that you cannot have meetings of presidential candidates
[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:57.860]   in a primary that are not approved of by the party.
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:01.220]   Right, like they've got this thing figured out,
[02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:03.260]   so we don't have any way in.
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:07.180]   And now, Unity 2024 makes sense
[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:10.520]   because Unity 2020 was tried, okay?
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:14.640]   I don't know that we get to 2024 under all circumstances.
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:16.680]   In some, we do, in some, we don't.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:18.440]   - But there's a game theoretic thing
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:20.200]   that I'm not sure you're accounting for,
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:22.960]   but you probably are, but let me just make an argument.
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:29.560]   Is Jack Dorsey very likely listens to your podcasts?
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:34.280]   And this is the power of these words.
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.220]   - Something deep went wrong.
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:41.520]   - But we can change it with the power of words.
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.000]   - Something went wrong at Twitter.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.120]   - They have so much division on their platform.
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:47.080]   - That's what I'm trying to say.
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:48.000]   They've gotten--
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.320]   - It's not wrong, they just don't know,
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:50.680]   they're understaffed.
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:53.520]   - No, they have an insoluble problem.
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:54.400]   - Difficult to solve.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:56.320]   - They have an insoluble problem.
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:57.960]   - This is where you and I disagree.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:02:58.800]   - Because, well, all right.
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:00.520]   - Or I'd like to create a competitor.
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:03.560]   - No, so then, you know, give it to me.
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:04.440]   Create the competitor.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:06.500]   Show me that you actually understood this,
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:08.640]   because my guess is that most of the things
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:10.360]   that you'll think about, I mean,
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.560]   I can tell you things I've talked to Jack about,
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:14.760]   which I know would make Twitter much better.
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:19.540]   However, I think that this problem
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:22.520]   of instantaneous communication across the planet,
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:24.760]   and you subtract off all sorts of context
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.240]   and mutual self-knowledge, the problem is us.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:29.780]   It's not the platforms.
[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:32.320]   You're thinking about a technological solution,
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:34.160]   and I'm saying the problem is
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:36.080]   is that we are ultimately the product.
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:38.200]   - And I just disagree with that,
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.720]   and there's a lot of, probably could save that for tomorrow.
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:44.080]   - I look forward to spending summers in your villa
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:47.100]   when you debut this product,
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:49.040]   and I would love to angel invest in it.
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:52.120]   - By the way, in terms of money,
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:55.080]   I'll never have a villa.
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:56.000]   - Yeah?
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.320]   - No, I will always give away everything, Alan.
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:03:59.680]   - Don't do that.
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:03.760]   - No, sorry, invest into things like you mentioned,
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:04.720]   awesome things.
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:06.920]   - Yeah, yeah, invest, fine,
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:10.180]   but a little bit of avuncular advice.
[02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:15.680]   Don't pledge to be the person
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:20.120]   who disgorges themselves of security.
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:21.800]   Money is freedom.
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:22.800]   That's what it is.
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:26.440]   It's a big, honking pile of freedom, okay?
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:29.320]   You can choose to use it as the freedom to imprison you
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:30.160]   if you don't, you know,
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:32.040]   so you can use it as freedom to make yourself
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:33.640]   a prisoner of your money,
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:35.800]   but generally speaking, Lex,
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:39.640]   money is freedom, and your voice is important.
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:43.120]   At least retain the amount of money, security you need
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:46.120]   to follow Joe's advice.
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:50.040]   What is the point of FU money if you don't say FU?
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:53.500]   The number of people who have FU money who don't say FU
[02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:55.160]   indicates the number of people
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:59.000]   who chose the freedom of their wealth to create a prison.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:04:59.840]   - Yeah.
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:01.160]   - They built a prison with the freedom they had,
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:04.080]   and they walked into it, locked the door.
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:06.640]   - I think it's too difficult not to create,
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:08.120]   the reason I wanna give away the money
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:09.760]   is 'cause I just know my own psychology,
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:11.080]   and you create prisons.
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:14.080]   Our human mind just creates those prisons.
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:19.080]   The FU money is enough for basic shelter and basic food.
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:22.960]   That's the optimal FU money.
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:23.800]   - You don't have kids yet.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:25.800]   - This is a, okay, this is the problem.
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:28.960]   This is why I'm, so this is me, single Lex,
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:31.880]   speaking, but kids change it.
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:34.600]   - Future Lex, I'm talking to future Lex.
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:38.060]   Single present Lex, please don't listen.
[02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:39.560]   Don't be an ass.
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:41.160]   You're gonna need some money,
[02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:45.360]   and don't make these pledges to say on a podcast.
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:46.880]   I wanna save you from yourself.
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:50.360]   You need money to do many of the beautiful things
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:51.780]   that we're counting on you to do.
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:52.760]   Don't F it up.
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:58.760]   - Can I talk to you about Roger Penrose?
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:05:59.600]   - Sure.
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:02.520]   - You've talked to Roger on the portal,
[02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:05.560]   but also in between the lines and offline,
[02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:08.760]   just everything you've said about Roger Penrose.
[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:09.640]   For people who don't know,
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:14.520]   he just recently, a few days ago, won the 2020,
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:18.120]   shared the 2020 Nobel Prize for physics.
[02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:21.280]   But it's clear to me that he had
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.920]   like a deep personal impact on you,
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.100]   a connection with you,
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:28.560]   in terms of both your love of mathematics,
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:30.640]   just the way you see the world.
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:32.640]   This is the Eddie Van Halen conversation.
[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:35.960]   This is clearly somebody who's profound in your worldview.
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:37.940]   Can you talk about Roger?
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:40.320]   Can you talk about what it means
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:42.560]   that he won this highest of prizes?
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:44.320]   Just in general, let's celebrate the man.
[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:45.640]   - Yeah, okay.
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:47.040]   So first of all, there are two other people
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:48.000]   who won this prize.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.520]   I'm sorry, I just didn't happen to know
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:51.020]   who they were before they won.
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:56.560]   Roger is a very,
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:59.320]   it is not Roger in particular,
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:04.320]   but the class from which Roger comes that is so important.
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.640]   So I would put Roger in the class
[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:11.400]   of Feynman, Einstein, Dirac, Yang.
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:15.680]   - Put Witten in there?
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:16.520]   - Yeah. - Or no?
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:19.560]   - I mean, Witten's a special case,
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:23.320]   but Witten is weirdly the reverse
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:25.080]   of the Roger Penrose story, right?
[02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:27.120]   Because Witten is the first physicist
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:29.240]   to win a mathematical fields medal,
[02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:31.720]   the highest honor in mathematics.
[02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:34.040]   Penrose is in some sense a mathematician
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:36.040]   who's now won the Nobel Prize.
[02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.840]   So it's a perfect sort of a couplet.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:45.240]   Roger's class means everything to me.
[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:48.640]   That's the highest achievement of the human mind.
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:51.000]   I'd probably throw Bach in
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.260]   with Feynman and Dirac and company, right?
[02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:56.060]   (Roger laughs)
[02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:59.340]   I think that he was so inventive.
[02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:01.820]   It was very frustrating to watch this career.
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:04.740]   It was a little bit frustrating to watch Feynman's career.
[02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:10.260]   Feynman was so good,
[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:13.940]   and had he been born at a slightly different time,
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:18.940]   I believe his claim on physics would be far greater.
[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:23.500]   I feel like Penrose in some sense
[02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:25.100]   came up a very difficult path
[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:27.420]   because you see, Einstein effectively solved
[02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:29.180]   most of the most important problems
[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:31.980]   in general relativity right at the beginning.
[02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:35.220]   As a result, the children of Einstein are impoverished
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:38.620]   because there wasn't as much to pick off of the trees
[02:08:38.620 --> 02:08:39.620]   and sell at the market,
[02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:43.700]   whereas Bohr and Planck didn't do nearly as good of a job
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:44.580]   with quantum theory,
[02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:47.300]   so there's lots to do in quantum theory.
[02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:50.220]   I think that Roger affected me personally
[02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:56.220]   by a diagram that I saw in a paper of Herman Gluck
[02:08:56.220 --> 02:08:59.100]   at the University of Pennsylvania.
[02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:00.740]   It was the first picture I'd ever seen
[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:03.340]   of the Hopf vibration sketched,
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:06.900]   and weirdly, I brought that to the Rogan program
[02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:10.340]   in order to sort of convey the wonder.
[02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:12.340]   It was recapitulating my own journey.
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:17.420]   I think I probably saw that at age 16 or something,
[02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:18.880]   and it just flipped my mind.
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:23.600]   Roger's incredibly visual, he's incredibly geometric,
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:28.600]   he's incredibly sui generis, he just does his own thing.
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:30.840]   He's got lots of bets.
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:35.340]   None of them had really come through the way you would hope,
[02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:38.880]   and I think they stretched the rules, to be blunt about it.
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:41.040]   - To give him the prize. - Yeah, I do.
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:43.640]   - You said this thing on Twitter which is beautiful,
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:46.280]   that every once in a while comes a human being
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:50.400]   that gives value to the prize
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:52.640]   versus the prize giving value to the human.
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:54.040]   - Two different kinds of prizes.
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:56.920]   The reason that we care about the Nobel Prize
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:59.240]   isn't because of Alfred Nobel.
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:02.960]   It's because it came along at the right time to reward
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:09.560]   Einstein, Dirac, Schrodinger, Feynman.
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:13.920]   Most of the people who should have won, won.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:18.320]   Most of the awards are not good
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:20.480]   in the sense that they don't really follow.
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:25.680]   The prize is used to rewrite history, that's its problem.
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:28.720]   So you should have a love-hate relationship with it
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:31.240]   because on the one hand it does focus the world
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:33.300]   on what really matters, and on the other hand
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:34.840]   it distorts what really matters,
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:38.040]   and both of those functions take place simultaneously.
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:40.000]   In this case, I think that they violated
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.760]   their own rules slightly.
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:46.000]   So it wasn't really clearly a case of a prediction
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.840]   and a discovery in the typical fashion,
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:52.520]   but we better give this award to somebody
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:56.600]   of that highest caliber to make sure that the prize
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:59.800]   is fully funded with prestige going forward.
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:02.680]   That's sort of my weird speculative guess
[02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:04.240]   as to what happened.
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:06.120]   And so Roger's getting on in years,
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:08.080]   and the person should be alive,
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:11.000]   so I think they bent the rules,
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.320]   and I think they couldn't have bent it for a better person,
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:16.640]   and I hope they will not bend the rules out of weakness
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:19.080]   but out of strength in the future.
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.880]   Would be great to get Madame Wu and Emmy Noether
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:27.320]   a posthumous prize along with Doug Prasher,
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:32.020]   George Sudarshan, and George Zweig,
[02:11:32.020 --> 02:11:35.000]   as well as Ernst Stuckelberg, Nobel Prizes.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.560]   There have been some terrible omissions.
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:42.880]   The first two being females who revolutionized
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:44.880]   our view of the world.
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:49.880]   And I take a very dim view of people pushing for prizes
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:52.840]   for people from ethnic groups or genders or whatever
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:55.240]   in order to make it plural and inclusive
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:57.160]   if it's not following the work,
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:59.500]   and I feel very clear that in a few cases
[02:11:59.500 --> 02:12:01.760]   we know there was a real problem with the Nobel Committee
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.160]   because we have stunning accomplishments.
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:08.080]   And to try to get through a day as a physicist
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.280]   without Noether's theorem,
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:12.180]   and try to imagine the universe
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:14.600]   without Madame Wu's discovery that left and right
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:16.560]   don't appear to be symmetric.
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:18.640]   I mean, these are terrible omissions,
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:21.660]   and they're a huge blot on science
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:25.520]   for not being more inclusive when it matters.
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:26.640]   - Yeah, so just like you said,
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.200]   the Nobel Prize is plagued by omissions as much as--
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.580]   - And distortions and dilutions.
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:33.960]   For example, Dirac and Schrodinger were, I believe,
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:35.880]   given the prize in the same year.
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:37.560]   There's no reason that those two people
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:39.360]   needed to dilute each other.
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:43.640]   The same thing with, you know, Dyson was an omission.
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:46.120]   Tomonaga probably got included in part
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:48.580]   because we had an opportunity to show
[02:12:48.580 --> 02:12:51.080]   that something had happened on both sides of the Pacific
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:52.140]   after the war.
[02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:57.300]   But I don't think we needed to dilute Weinberg
[02:12:57.300 --> 02:12:59.520]   or Feynman or Schwinger.
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:01.840]   It just makes me, it makes me somewhat sick.
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:04.480]   All of these people are such important giants,
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:06.800]   and it has to do with the field, I think,
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:10.880]   not wanting to create luminaries and superstars
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:13.480]   who could have defended the field from budget cuts
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:14.940]   and worldly pressure.
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:16.720]   So I think it's really important
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:19.280]   that we have absolute superstars
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:20.760]   because we produce superstars.
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:22.860]   We acknowledge them, we don't dilute them,
[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:26.000]   and that we bend the rules to make sure
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:29.000]   that the prize stays funded with the prestige
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.880]   that comes from giving it to the Roger Penrose's,
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:35.440]   and Albert Einstein's, and Paul Dirac's of the war.
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:39.680]   - Can we talk a little bit about evil?
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:40.520]   - Sure.
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:45.320]   - I haven't actually talked to you about this topic,
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:48.040]   and it's been sitting on my mind
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:52.380]   mostly because everybody at MIT is quiet about it,
[02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:55.420]   which is Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:14:01.180]   I didn't get a chance to experience what MIT was like
[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:04.400]   at the time when Jeffrey Epstein was part of this,
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:08.600]   but I'd love to try to understand
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:14.200]   how evil was allowed to flourish
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:16.760]   in the place that I love.
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:20.020]   Whether you think,
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:24.200]   maybe let me ask the question this way.
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:28.800]   Was it the man evil, or was the system evil?
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.840]   Or is evil too strong a word?
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:38.640]   Because what I see is the presence
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:41.560]   of this particular human being
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:46.120]   in the eyes of many destroyed
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:50.600]   the reputations of many really strong scientists,
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:53.640]   and also weakened the ability,
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:58.200]   like weakened the institution of MIT
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:02.520]   by making everybody quiet,
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:04.640]   like almost making them unable to say
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:06.500]   anything interesting or difficult.
[02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:09.480]   - Yeah.
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:11.400]   - And what is that?
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:12.760]   And what am I supposed to?
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:15.200]   - We don't know.
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:16.520]   - Why is everyone quiet about Jeffrey?
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:20.000]   What I wanna scream-- - We don't know.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.400]   Obviously, I wanna scream about it too, right?
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:25.240]   And I probably have said too much about Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:29.560]   Look, something horrible happened.
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:33.280]   I don't know what it is, but something horrible happened.
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:39.200]   And at the one thing that, okay, let's just do this.
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:41.880]   The first thing I need to do is I need to get rid
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:46.880]   of this woke crap about power differentials, okay?
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:51.400]   In general, you can talk about,
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:53.760]   hypergamy and power differentials
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:56.840]   are Russell conjugates of the same concept.
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:00.160]   Just the way particular proportions and symmetries
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:02.880]   are mathematically provable to be attractive
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:06.020]   in females to males.
[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:10.480]   Male attractiveness is largely determined
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:15.280]   by male competence and ability to amass power and success
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:16.840]   and all these sorts of things.
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:23.100]   The relationship between consenting adults
[02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:25.760]   is quite frankly not something I wanna sort out.
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:31.180]   The relationship between the sexuality of adults
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:35.180]   and minors and particularly,
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:40.440]   there's the 17, 18 issue.
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:44.220]   That's very different than 12, 13.
[02:16:44.220 --> 02:16:50.220]   We're talking about really sick depravity
[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:52.280]   with respect to what it appears
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:56.280]   that Jeffrey Epstein was involved in at some level.
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:59.680]   I believe this story is super complicated in part
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:02.760]   because I think one thing that Jeffrey Epstein was doing
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:06.720]   was providing money, encouragement
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:09.640]   and support to scientists.
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:11.360]   Another thing he was doing, I believe,
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:15.840]   was giving tax advice to very rich people.
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:17.800]   I believe another thing he was doing
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:22.800]   was hooking very wealthy people up
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:26.040]   with young adult females.
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:28.960]   Another thing he was doing, I think,
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:33.120]   was doing stuff with children that will curl your toes.
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:39.680]   So there's an entire spectrum of different stuff
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:42.160]   and at the moment, nobody can pull apart
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:46.120]   or de-conflate anything because the woke thing
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:48.120]   comes over it and says,
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:53.280]   I think it's disgusting that a 43-year-old billionaire
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:55.640]   would be partying with a 23-year-old.
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:18:00.200]   Okay, I don't wanna adjudicate that.
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:02.440]   I'm worried about 12 and 14-year-olds
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:03.600]   that we're not talking about.
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:05.040]   - But I mostly--
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:08.440]   - I don't think MIT was deep into pedophilia.
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:10.600]   My guess is that that did not happen.
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:15.600]   I don't think that the scientists were the targets
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:18.120]   of the really sick depraved stuff.
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:19.880]   It's my guess.
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:21.920]   My guess is that what you're looking at
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:23.560]   was a government construct.
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:26.280]   It may have been our government,
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:27.880]   it may have been a joint government project,
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:31.360]   it may have been somebody else's government, I don't know.
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:32.840]   I believe that in part,
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:37.020]   we don't really understand Robert Maxwell.
[02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:39.480]   - Sorry, who's Robert Maxwell?
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:43.080]   - Ghislaine Maxwell's father was very active
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:44.760]   in scientific publishing.
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:46.540]   I don't know where peer review came from.
[02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:48.440]   I would love to run down the relationship
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:50.320]   between peer review and Robert Maxwell.
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:52.760]   I would love to run down the missing fortune
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:56.160]   of Robert Maxwell and the mysterious fortune
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.680]   of Jeffrey Epstein because I don't think Jeffrey Epstein
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:00.720]   ever ran a hedge fund.
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:02.360]   I don't think he was a money advisor
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:04.160]   the way people claimed.
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:06.120]   - So there's two things I wanna talk about.
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:10.080]   So one is the shallow conversations
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:13.560]   of woke identity politics that you're referring to
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:17.320]   seems to be removing everyone's ability,
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:18.160]   no, everyone's willingness--
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:19.760]   - It's one of the things, one of the things.
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:23.360]   - To talk about like, what the hell is this person
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:24.640]   and how is he allowed?
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:29.640]   Most importantly, to how do we prevent it in the future?
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:31.420]   And from the individual perspective,
[02:19:31.420 --> 02:19:34.800]   the question for me is the same question I ask
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:36.600]   about 1930s Nazi Germany.
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:38.680]   I've been reading way too much probably,
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:41.140]   or not enough about that period currently,
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:44.640]   is if I was in Germany at that time,
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:47.160]   what is the heroic action to take?
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:49.600]   When I think about MIT with Jeffrey Epstein,
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:51.560]   what is the heroic action to take?
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:53.400]   We're not talking about virtue signaling action.
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:54.640]   - You wouldn't know what,
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:56.800]   I would not know what you're up against, Lex.
[02:19:56.800 --> 02:19:57.900]   You're not hearing me.
[02:19:57.900 --> 02:20:02.560]   The problem here is, what was Jeffrey Epstein?
[02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:05.800]   - Well, that question might be the heroic action to take.
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:06.760]   - That's all I'm trying to say.
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:08.320]   I'm just trying to get my first question.
[02:20:08.320 --> 02:20:10.880]   You have to map the silence with Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:15.640]   What you're describing is a map of the silence at MIT.
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:17.160]   - Yeah.
[02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:19.440]   - Well, is there a map of the silence
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:23.200]   in Washington State around Jeffrey Epstein?
[02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:25.140]   The Bay Area, New York City?
[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:28.440]   The amount of silence around Jeffrey Epstein
[02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:30.080]   should be telling you everything.
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:34.000]   The number of dogs that don't bark
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.320]   is like nothing we've ever seen.
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:38.040]   - You're exactly correct,
[02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:40.120]   but I want to know what is it telling us?
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:42.120]   Because what it's telling me
[02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:44.440]   is not some kind of conspiracy,
[02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:49.440]   but more a disappointing weakness.
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.120]   - Not some kind of conspiracy?
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:52.960]   - It's not some kind of conspiracy, but--
[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:55.040]   - You've got to be kidding.
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:56.960]   You're so afraid of saying the word conspiracy
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:20:58.880]   that you don't think it's a conspiracy?
[02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:00.960]   - I personally, I just think it's people
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:04.520]   who I thought were my heroes just being weak.
[02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:05.980]   - No.
[02:21:05.980 --> 02:21:07.140]   Be of good cheer, sir.
[02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:09.080]   - A cheer?
[02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:10.200]   - Be of good cheer.
[02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:11.040]   - Of good cheer?
[02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:11.880]   - Yeah.
[02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:12.880]   - You think that there's a conspiracy?
[02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:14.480]   - I think there is a conspiracy.
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:18.360]   - That'd be a very impressive one.
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:20.280]   That's the scale of it.
[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:23.560]   I tend to believe that large scale
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:25.440]   can only be an emergent phenomena.
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:26.800]   - Really?
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:28.200]   I find this so fascinating.
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:29.040]   - Yeah.
[02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:31.240]   - 'Cause I always see you as like a logic,
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:35.120]   logic and love drive your soul.
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:37.560]   You're very logical, you're relentless,
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:38.920]   you've got a lot of love in your heart.
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:41.160]   I believe that if you would review the video,
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:43.680]   where is it from, Dubai or Abu Dhabi
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:47.520]   of the mysterious hit on the hotel guest?
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:48.360]   You ever seen this thing?
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:49.200]   - No.
[02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:50.020]   What happened?
[02:21:50.020 --> 02:21:53.760]   - It's the assassination in 2010, 10 years ago
[02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:57.440]   of Mahmoud Al-Mabuh, something like that,
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:02.440]   in Dubai where I believe 26 separate individuals
[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:07.440]   on multiple teams are shown converging,
[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:10.920]   coming in from all over the world on false passports,
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:14.040]   pretending to be tennis players
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:17.440]   or business people or vacationers.
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:21.880]   And all of these teams have different functions
[02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:27.080]   and they murder this guy in his hotel room.
[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:29.960]   And the Dubai, I guess, chief of police
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:34.600]   or security officer was so angry
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:36.680]   that he put together this amazing video
[02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:39.720]   that says we can completely detail what you did.
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:41.720]   We caught you on closed circuit TV.
[02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:44.280]   We don't know exactly who you are
[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:46.800]   'cause your disguises and your false passports.
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:50.020]   But yeah, 26 people converged to kill one.
[02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:53.600]   No, I don't believe you.
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:58.000]   I don't believe after COINTELPRO and Operation Paperclip
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.000]   and Operation Mockingbird,
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:06.040]   I don't know whether I should even bring up Rex84,
[02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:10.700]   to not believe in conspiracies is an idiocy.
[02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:16.560]   - So you have a sense that evil can be as competent
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:18.000]   or more competent than--
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.720]   - First of all, when evil wants to operate at scale,
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:22.440]   it needs to make sure that people
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:24.900]   don't try to figure out evil.
[02:23:24.900 --> 02:23:29.120]   When evil operates at scale, from first principles,
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:33.520]   you have to realize that evil must not want it investigated.
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:35.080]   - That's correct.
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:36.640]   - The most efficient way
[02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:40.080]   to keep yourself from being investigated,
[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:42.640]   if you are an evil institutional player
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:44.560]   and needs to do this repeatedly,
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:47.760]   is to invest in a world in which no one can afford
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:49.880]   to say the word conspiracy.
[02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:52.720]   You'll notice that there is a special radioactivity
[02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:54.440]   around the word conspiracy.
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:56.100]   We have provable conspiracies.
[02:23:56.100 --> 02:23:57.720]   We have admitted to conspiracies.
[02:23:57.720 --> 02:23:59.920]   You have been invited to conspiracies.
[02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:00.760]   There is no shortage.
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:02.700]   Conspiracies are everywhere.
[02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:04.100]   Some of them are mundane.
[02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:06.440]   Some of them are like price-fixing cartels,
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:10.240]   or trade groups, or generally speaking, conspiracies.
[02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:13.280]   So the first thing you have to realize
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:16.200]   is that all of us are under a,
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:20.320]   in a mimetic complex where you can be taken
[02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:22.920]   off the chessboard by saying conspiracy theorists.
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:23.760]   Good done.
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:24.960]   It's like a one-line proof.
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:26.040]   We don't have to listen to Alex.
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:28.960]   He said he was a conspiracy theorist on this show.
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:32.560]   Okay, that is partially distorting our conversation.
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:34.500]   If you want to ask me about Jeffrey Epstein,
[02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:37.900]   you have to agree with me that that is a logical description
[02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:39.300]   of what you would have to have
[02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:40.980]   if you wanted to commit conspiracies,
[02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:42.660]   is that you have to make sure that people
[02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:44.980]   are dissuaded from investigating this.
[02:24:44.980 --> 02:24:46.220]   Okay.
[02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:51.060]   - But it's a fascinatingly difficult idea then,
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:53.420]   because the world with conspiracy theories
[02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:56.100]   and the world without conspiracy theories,
[02:24:56.100 --> 02:24:58.820]   to the shallow glance, looks the same.
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:03.820]   - Well, my point, there is responsible conspiracy theorizing
[02:25:03.820 --> 02:25:08.560]   where you look at the history of unearthed conspiracies,
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:10.560]   and just like you would with any other topic,
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:13.600]   just think about how different the rules in your mind are
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:16.760]   for conspiracy theorizing versus X theorizing
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:20.080]   where X can be anything, right?
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:21.400]   It's like if I say to you,
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:27.720]   I can say the statement that average weight
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:30.720]   is not the same between widely separated populations.
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:33.100]   You'd say, yeah.
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:34.600]   I'd say average height is not the same
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:36.560]   between widely separated populations.
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:38.680]   You'd say, yeah.
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:42.360]   Then I say, in fact, no continuous variable
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:44.840]   that shows variation should be expected
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:46.800]   to be identical between widely separated.
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:49.040]   Of course, Eric, like IQ.
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:52.280]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, right?
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:56.760]   So we have a violent reaction to specific topics.
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:59.760]   So the first thing I wanna do is just to notice
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:04.080]   that conspiracy has that built into everyone's mind.
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:07.200]   - That's really important to state, yeah.
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:09.520]   It's very interesting that,
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:13.000]   and as a prerequisite, as you're saying,
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.200]   that would be the first step if you wanted to
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:19.360]   pull off a conspiracy in a competent way.
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:21.800]   You would have to first convince the world of that.
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:24.360]   - I just watched the film 1971
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:26.640]   about my favorite conspiracy of all time.
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:27.920]   I highly recommend it.
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:29.240]   - 1971?
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:32.480]   - Well, the film is entitled 1971,
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:34.040]   and it's about the Citizens Committee
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:36.320]   to investigate the FBI,
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:41.240]   which was run by a student of Murray Gelman, a physicist,
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:44.640]   and broke into FBI offices in Pennsylvania
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:48.080]   to steal files which allowed freedom of information requests
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:50.000]   that discovered a huge conspiracy.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.160]   It was a conspiracy that unearthed a conspiracy
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:54.680]   inside the federal government,
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:56.320]   a double conspiracy story,
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:00.680]   which launched multiple conspiracies.
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:03.000]   I think that the problem with modern Americans
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.320]   is that they are so timid that they don't even learn
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:08.200]   about the history of conspiracies
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:10.800]   that we have absolutely proven.
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:15.280]   So with that done, Jeff Epstein, in my opinion,
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:17.680]   represented somebody's construction.
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:20.920]   I don't think that-- - Kind of scary to think about.
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:21.760]   - Yeah.
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:24.960]   Well, what part of the story isn't scary?
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:26.680]   I, in part, did something
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:28.960]   which I imagine may get me destroyed
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:31.920]   because I was more worried about being destroyed
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:34.800]   by somebody else I had a conversation with
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:37.600]   around Jeff Epstein, right?
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:40.560]   So I'm just trying to let it be known
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:43.040]   that I don't know anything more than I've already said.
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:46.040]   Now, your friends at MIT,
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:50.360]   their problem is that Jeff Epstein showed up
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:52.240]   as the only person capable
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:55.640]   of continuing US scientific tradition.
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:28:00.560]   You see, the US scientific tradition
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:03.480]   is a little bit like the Russian.
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:07.480]   It's combative, okay?
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:12.340]   And we're a free society and we act like a free society.
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:14.280]   We're a rich society and we research
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:15.640]   like we're a rich society.
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:16.680]   That is historically.
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:19.160]   And then came the 1970s.
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:21.960]   And William Proxmire and the Golden Fleece Awards
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:24.400]   and the idea that we're paying too much
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:26.400]   and these are welfare queens and lab coats
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:27.960]   and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:31.120]   We need more transparency, more oversight.
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:32.360]   Everything went to hell.
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:37.400]   And the national culture of US science was lost.
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:39.520]   The thing that produced all this prosperity
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:43.320]   and security and power was lost.
[02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:44.920]   And then Jeff Epstein shows up.
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:49.840]   And a tiny number of funders, maybe Fred Kavli,
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:56.800]   maybe Yuri Milner, maybe who else would be in this category?
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:29:01.240]   Peter Thiel to an extent.
[02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:05.160]   Howard Hughes would be the largest of these things
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:08.120]   which has different grant structures than the NIH,
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:11.880]   gave people a modicum of risk-taking ability.
[02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:15.260]   Okay, well, when Jeff Epstein showed up,
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:20.000]   everybody wanted to take risk in science.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.720]   And suddenly a charismatic billionaire says,
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:24.200]   hey, I can make that work for you.
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:27.180]   Here's $100,000, go research something crazy.
[02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:31.520]   Well, that money was supposed to be provided
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:34.760]   by the federal government under the terms
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.600]   of the endless frontier compact
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:39.000]   between the federal government and the universities.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.040]   And the federal government and the taxpayers welched.
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:42.880]   Okay?
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:46.580]   - So that's one place to lay the blame for Jeff Epstein
[02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:50.660]   as at the failure of the federal government--
[02:29:50.660 --> 02:29:53.380]   - To honor its commitment.
[02:29:53.380 --> 02:29:54.220]   - Yeah.
[02:29:54.220 --> 02:29:55.300]   - Right?
[02:29:55.300 --> 02:29:57.940]   So the universities became psychopathic.
[02:29:57.940 --> 02:29:59.620]   It's not like everybody doesn't remember
[02:29:59.620 --> 02:30:02.380]   what we're supposed to be doing to be moral.
[02:30:02.380 --> 02:30:04.940]   But the point was there wasn't enough money to be moral.
[02:30:04.940 --> 02:30:09.520]   So it was time to eye each other as a source of protein,
[02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:11.020]   as I like to say.
[02:30:11.020 --> 02:30:14.260]   And in that process, Jeffrey Epstein said,
[02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:16.660]   hey, come to my world.
[02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:19.420]   We can do it like we used to do.
[02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:25.560]   So in part, my point is that almost none
[02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:28.900]   of your colleagues at MIT have that kind
[02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:30.960]   of religious commitment to science,
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:33.460]   that they're willing to go down with ship science.
[02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:39.740]   The Galileo Galilei thing became very important to science
[02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:42.740]   because occasionally you just have to say,
[02:30:42.740 --> 02:30:45.980]   look, this isn't about me and you.
[02:30:45.980 --> 02:30:48.180]   There isn't enough money in the world
[02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:51.180]   to buy the kind of legacy I want to leave to this planet.
[02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:55.420]   This is one of the great things about science.
[02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:57.500]   You know, potentially it's worth dying for.
[02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:01.660]   - Yeah, I'm glad you said it.
[02:31:01.660 --> 02:31:05.380]   Science is one of the things at its best
[02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:06.580]   that's worth dying for.
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:10.880]   I mean, I'm not eager to martyr myself,
[02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:15.800]   but I've certainly risked my health, my fortune.
[02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:20.820]   You know, I've destroyed myself economically over science.
[02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:25.820]   And my need to oppose these sons of bitches
[02:31:25.820 --> 02:31:30.860]   in chaired professorships who are destroying our system
[02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:32.100]   along with everyone else.
[02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:39.340]   - Let me bring in Grandmaster Uguay into this.
[02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:40.740]   - Uguay. - Uguay.
[02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:41.660]   - Master Uguay.
[02:31:41.660 --> 02:31:44.620]   - I think he's a grandmaster.
[02:31:44.620 --> 02:31:46.860]   - Oh, that would make him a chess-playing turtle.
[02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:48.300]   - So I read some Wikipedia.
[02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:49.140]   - Uh-oh.
[02:31:49.140 --> 02:31:52.340]   - A she-fu's a master.
[02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:55.420]   There's apparently only one grandmaster, and that's Uguay.
[02:31:55.420 --> 02:31:57.340]   Anyway.
[02:31:57.340 --> 02:31:59.340]   - Is the phrase grandmaster ever uttered in the script?
[02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:00.660]   - I don't think so. - I don't think so.
[02:32:00.660 --> 02:32:01.820]   - But there's a story.
[02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:05.460]   - Oh, there's off-script canon?
[02:32:05.460 --> 02:32:07.140]   I'm gonna call Glenn Burger right now
[02:32:07.140 --> 02:32:09.140]   and find out if any of this is true.
[02:32:09.140 --> 02:32:11.060]   - All right, you're not supposed to call out
[02:32:11.060 --> 02:32:12.600]   my journalistic integrity.
[02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:15.580]   But-- - Master Uguay.
[02:32:15.580 --> 02:32:17.180]   - Master Uguay.
[02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:20.660]   He says a couple things I'd like to bring up with you.
[02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:23.460]   So one, as part of a longer quote,
[02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:28.460]   recommends that you should find a battle worth fighting.
[02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:34.440]   We've talked about several battles just now.
[02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:39.860]   What is the battle worth fighting for, for Erik Weinstein,
[02:32:39.860 --> 02:32:43.620]   in the next few months, in the next year?
[02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:44.580]   - There's only one.
[02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:51.620]   Well, it's the Moses, it's the Moses thing.
[02:32:51.620 --> 02:32:54.820]   It's time to go, it's time to leave.
[02:32:54.820 --> 02:32:55.800]   This place is over.
[02:32:55.800 --> 02:32:57.000]   - To get off the planet.
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.380]   - Yeah, I freak people out when I say that,
[02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:03.420]   but look at your world.
[02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:07.220]   You just got introduced to the problem of a virus.
[02:33:07.220 --> 02:33:08.940]   Wait 'til it's fusion devices,
[02:33:08.940 --> 02:33:10.140]   and you understand what it means
[02:33:10.140 --> 02:33:12.020]   to have one interconnected planet
[02:33:12.020 --> 02:33:17.020]   with no uncorrelated experiments happening anywhere else.
[02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:23.380]   - So do you see the foray, your work in physics,
[02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:27.180]   and maybe the echoes of it in ship Elon?
[02:33:28.020 --> 02:33:31.380]   Everybody who has a possible plan
[02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:34.740]   to avoid what is coming if we don't have one
[02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:39.740]   should work on the plan that he, she thinks best, right?
[02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:43.660]   So Elon wants to do rockets.
[02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:45.100]   People misinterpret me.
[02:33:45.100 --> 02:33:49.280]   Meta Erik says, "I don't think that's a smart plan."
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:56.420]   Regular Erik says, "All people who have hope should work."
[02:33:56.420 --> 02:33:59.140]   - Everybody who has hope should do that thing.
[02:33:59.140 --> 02:34:01.820]   - Yeah, that-- - At least it's Mars, man.
[02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:04.980]   At least it's the moon and Mars and maybe Titan and whatever,
[02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:06.060]   and I don't think it'll work,
[02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:08.020]   and it doesn't make sense, and it looks silly.
[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:09.900]   - But that's exactly the kind of fight worth fighting.
[02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:12.180]   - But it's the kind of, it's for the same reason
[02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:14.500]   that I went on Brett's Unity 2020 thing
[02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:16.020]   when I didn't think it had a hope in hell,
[02:34:16.020 --> 02:34:17.700]   and people were making fun of it.
[02:34:17.700 --> 02:34:19.180]   It's just like, we gotta do things
[02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:22.700]   that make us feel dumb and silly and childish
[02:34:22.700 --> 02:34:25.380]   that possibly have a hope of working, okay?
[02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:27.140]   So everybody should do something.
[02:34:27.140 --> 02:34:29.660]   My version of this, I am the most hopeful about
[02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:31.700]   because I wouldn't have chosen to do it
[02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:35.280]   if I thought that Daniel Schmachtenberger's wisdom project
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:37.860]   was a better hope, I'd do that.
[02:34:37.860 --> 02:34:41.980]   It's more down to earth in a certain way.
[02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:44.180]   I just think that it's more probable.
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:46.580]   Look, we got from powered flight
[02:34:46.580 --> 02:34:49.060]   with the Wright brothers in wind tunnels
[02:34:49.060 --> 02:34:51.740]   to sending back images from the surface of Titan
[02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:56.420]   via Huygens-Cassini in less than a century, okay?
[02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:59.700]   What we can do if we can change the laws of physics
[02:34:59.700 --> 02:35:02.980]   is something we can't even conceive of.
[02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:05.160]   It may be that it buys us nothing,
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:10.600]   and at least we will know why we died on this planet.
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:16.580]   - As a small aside, I think this is not the right time
[02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:20.180]   to take the full journey, but I feel like you'll guide me,
[02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:24.620]   like Master Hui did, and I'm the Kung Fu Panda at some point.
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:26.380]   - They only have one conversation.
[02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:28.740]   We're on our like, what?
[02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:33.060]   - We didn't, well, we're Jews and they weren't,
[02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:34.900]   so we talk too much,
[02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:37.860]   but the guide doesn't have to be with words.
[02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:39.460]   - You don't think Poe is Jewish?
[02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:43.500]   - It's debatable, we'll have to go back to the Wikipedia.
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:44.340]   - Yeah, okay.
[02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:49.700]   Is there that you would guide me through
[02:35:49.700 --> 02:35:55.500]   some more intuition about the source code,
[02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:57.940]   the source code of our universe?
[02:35:57.940 --> 02:36:00.780]   Can you comment on where, since we last spoke,
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:02.660]   where your thinking has been,
[02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:05.000]   has roamed around geometric unity,
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:08.380]   around that work in physics, in this fight?
[02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:09.940]   - Yeah, I'm trying to figure out
[02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:13.180]   when to release it and how.
[02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:15.380]   I mean, I've released the video,
[02:36:15.380 --> 02:36:18.020]   and the video, quite honestly,
[02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:19.920]   I think it has a very bizarre reaction.
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:22.380]   I think one of the things that I've learned from the video,
[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:25.580]   'cause the video is coming up on half a million views
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:30.580]   on YouTube alone, to say nothing of the audio,
[02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:34.620]   but yeah, it produced a very strange reaction.
[02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:37.380]   One of the things I don't think that I properly understood
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:41.500]   is that most physicists don't talk
[02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:43.380]   in this geometric language.
[02:36:43.380 --> 02:36:48.380]   I thought that more of the physics world
[02:36:48.380 --> 02:36:52.900]   probably had converted over into manifolds, bundles,
[02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:54.300]   differential forms, connections,
[02:36:54.300 --> 02:36:55.920]   curvature tensors, et cetera.
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:37:00.340]   And I saw a lot of the comments would say things like,
[02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:02.340]   I have a PhD in theoretical physics,
[02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:04.860]   and I'm not even familiar with all of these concepts.
[02:37:04.860 --> 02:37:08.580]   And I think that was probably a distortion
[02:37:08.580 --> 02:37:12.100]   coming from living in Cambridge, Massachusetts
[02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:13.260]   for almost 20 years.
[02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:16.340]   - So what's the solution to that?
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:18.620]   - Well, I mean, I can translate it into,
[02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:21.260]   I can make this make as much sense as anybody needs to.
[02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:26.260]   My problem is, my calculation is that
[02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:30.980]   as long as the boomers are still in charge,
[02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:34.180]   the same people have these perverse incentives on them,
[02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:36.780]   where they've invested in these programs that didn't work,
[02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:38.580]   so they're extremely hostile
[02:37:38.580 --> 02:37:40.500]   and kind of difficult to deal with.
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:43.540]   The fact that I'm not a physicist
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:46.180]   has its own set of issues,
[02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:48.480]   which is that effectively it's like the hermit kingdom.
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:49.980]   They don't get any visitors,
[02:37:49.980 --> 02:37:53.780]   and they don't necessarily want somebody
[02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:56.940]   rolling up and saying, I know how to do physics.
[02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:59.420]   So I'm always very clear, I'm not a physicist.
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:04.020]   That said, if I wait too long,
[02:38:04.020 --> 02:38:05.660]   I don't know that theoretical physics
[02:38:05.660 --> 02:38:07.660]   is really gonna exist after the boomers
[02:38:07.660 --> 02:38:09.620]   because everyone in you,
[02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:12.260]   I think you had Wolfram on your program.
[02:38:12.260 --> 02:38:13.740]   I don't remember whether he said this to you
[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:14.980]   or Brian Keating,
[02:38:14.980 --> 02:38:17.660]   but he said something like, everybody got discouraged.
[02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:18.660]   It was too hard.
[02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:21.940]   We can't do that, guys.
[02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:23.060]   We cannot do that.
[02:38:23.060 --> 02:38:25.700]   There's something about the renormalization revolution
[02:38:25.700 --> 02:38:27.580]   that enervated the physics community
[02:38:27.580 --> 02:38:29.340]   because it taught them,
[02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:31.300]   just because you can see in this energy regime
[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:33.340]   doesn't mean you can extrapolate somewhere else
[02:38:33.340 --> 02:38:36.680]   unless you understand how coupling constants run
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:41.280]   and what kind of UV fixed points exist, blah, blah, blah.
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:43.840]   Somehow that discouraged people from guessing,
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:46.960]   from believing everything became an effective theory.
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:48.600]   The beauty of the effective theory
[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:51.560]   wasn't taken to be really the beauty of the universe,
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:53.320]   just the beauty of an energy level.
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:56.040]   So I think that renormalization
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:58.280]   was one of the most important revolutions
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:38:59.760]   that ever happened in science,
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:03.240]   and also its interpretation by the physics community
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:04.860]   was catastrophic.
[02:39:04.860 --> 02:39:06.240]   Well, the story I'm telling myself
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:09.020]   is that in part I'm waiting for them to get weaker,
[02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:10.960]   but on the other hand,
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:13.080]   I don't know that we have any time left.
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:16.180]   - Are you also thinking about ways of,
[02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:22.480]   the podcast medium is revolutionary for public,
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:23.920]   for discourse, for what,
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:25.880]   I mean, I don't even know the right words for it.
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:27.800]   Are you thinking of revolutionary ideas
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:30.640]   for re-energizing the physics community?
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:32.640]   So basically for communicating geometry.
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:36.040]   - Look, I have a fantasy, okay?
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:38.400]   My fantasy is that all of these things
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:39.960]   are the same problem.
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:42.080]   And it goes back to this thing that I read about
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:46.920]   in Feynman's books about Tartaglia.
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:48.080]   They asked him this question,
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:50.440]   like what's the greatest thing that ever happened in math?
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:53.560]   And he says, "Tartaglia's solution of the cubic."
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:55.800]   It's just like the weirdest answer.
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:58.040]   So you're like, okay, I'll bite.
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:00.360]   Why is it Tartaglia's solution of the cubic?
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:02.240]   And he said, "Because it was the first time
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:04.280]   "a modern person had done something profound
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:06.180]   "that the ancients had failed to do."
[02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:09.360]   I was like, oh, I get it.
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:11.780]   It's the thing that opens up new psychology
[02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:14.220]   that says maybe things are possible again.
[02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:16.840]   - It's the new orchard.
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:17.660]   - New orchard.
[02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:22.120]   New farmers, new people who can find fruit
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:23.620]   that they can pick.
[02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:25.780]   And once you have one person do that,
[02:40:25.780 --> 02:40:26.860]   very often you get many.
[02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:28.080]   Like one of the things that we were talking about
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:29.600]   with Eddie Van Halen,
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:31.840]   the reason that he created a revolution
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:34.800]   and somebody like Roy Buchanan did not,
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:36.940]   is that you could follow Eddie Van Halen.
[02:40:36.940 --> 02:40:38.360]   You couldn't pioneer it.
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:40.360]   And maybe you couldn't play as well and as cleanly
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:42.260]   and as fast and as inventively,
[02:40:42.260 --> 02:40:44.440]   but you could follow.
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:47.040]   Once you understand that there is a tapping principle,
[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:48.140]   it was just the beginning
[02:40:48.140 --> 02:40:50.080]   of something called percussive guitar.
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:56.180]   My belief is that once we start innovating in the present,
[02:40:56.180 --> 02:40:58.720]   everything will come
[02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:02.500]   because everything that around us is screwed up.
[02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:06.480]   - On that, let me, with one last question,
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:08.220]   bring back Master Oogway.
[02:41:08.220 --> 02:41:12.440]   Probably the most famous quote of his, right?
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:15.520]   With yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery,
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:16.740]   but today is a gift.
[02:41:16.740 --> 02:41:20.640]   That is why it is called the present.
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:21.480]   - It's very beautiful.
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:23.680]   Although I would have gone with,
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:27.480]   quit, don't quit, noodles, don't noodles.
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:30.480]   I feel like people need to know way too much context
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:32.600]   to make sense.
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:34.720]   It's your audience.
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:35.720]   To hell with context.
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:37.520]   Yep, they'll figure it out.
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:41.720]   Well, let me ask, what are you grateful for today?
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:43.080]   What is your present?
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:46.040]   We've talked about a lot of dark things,
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:50.440]   but what brings you joy to your heart
[02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:55.440]   that I can't believe I'm lucky enough to have this?
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:59.520]   - You know, Nyla and Zev, my wife, Pia,
[02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:02.960]   the fact that we've got our health,
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:07.960]   all the little things, saying grace after meals.
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:10.400]   You're coming over for Friday night Shabbat dinner,
[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:13.560]   so we'll bench together and say grace.
[02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:16.600]   It's important to just,
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:18.720]   like this bottle of water in front of me,
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:23.720]   I made a point of just thinking
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:26.520]   how wonderful it is that there's a quenching bottle
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:28.080]   that happens to be placed in front of me
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:29.640]   because somebody cared.
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:32.420]   So that small thing made a difference to me.
[02:42:32.420 --> 02:42:40.880]   I still have strength for the fight so far.
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:43.120]   I think that's something I'm grateful for.
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:45.800]   I can't believe that I'm not more beaten down
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:47.980]   after all of this nonsense.
[02:42:47.980 --> 02:42:54.280]   I have the most interesting set of friends.
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:55.120]   I really do.
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:59.880]   I mean, I'm not that rich by monetary standards,
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:01.720]   but if there were friend billionaires,
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:03.320]   Forbes would be all over my ass.
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:09.280]   I just can't believe who I can talk to,
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:11.180]   you know, at the drop of a hat.
[02:43:11.180 --> 02:43:16.060]   And I'm really grateful.
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:25.680]   I think this is the end of something profound,
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:28.800]   and it's the beginning of whatever is next.
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:30.600]   And whatever's next could be terminal.
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:32.560]   Whatever's next could be amazing.
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:36.120]   Whatever's next could be a return to the horrors
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:38.320]   of the early 20th century that doesn't manage
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:39.980]   to go totally catastrophic,
[02:43:39.980 --> 02:43:43.940]   but takes hundreds of millions of lives in the process.
[02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:47.420]   I'm grateful to having half of my life
[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:48.620]   in the rear view mirror.
[02:43:48.620 --> 02:43:52.080]   Maybe it took place in a bubble,
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:54.480]   and maybe it was unsustainable.
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:58.320]   But it was nice to be able to move around the world
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:00.160]   without a mask.
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:03.040]   It was nice to be able to see a little bit of the world,
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:07.560]   even if it was from a cot in a hostel in some country.
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:10.340]   - To fall in love.
[02:44:10.340 --> 02:44:12.560]   - Absolutely.
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:14.120]   I mean-- - It was a good life.
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:17.340]   - Find the last Indian Jewish girl left.
[02:44:17.340 --> 02:44:18.640]   (laughing)
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:19.480]   Who knew?
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:21.840]   You're a lucky guy.
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:23.560]   - Well, let me just say--
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:25.100]   - Actually, there's something I wanted to just say
[02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:26.880]   before you get to that.
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:28.720]   I forgot to say something.
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:32.000]   Falling in love with an intellectual collaborator
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.200]   is a special thing that not everybody gets a chance to do.
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:39.840]   I think when I met Pia, I fell deeply in love with her,
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:42.680]   all her normal characteristics.
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:45.800]   She and I had an antagonistic relationship
[02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:49.260]   around geometry and economics.
[02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:53.800]   And then, weirdly, just like in a buddy picture
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:56.800]   where in the first half of the film, they hate each other,
[02:44:56.800 --> 02:44:58.280]   the two feel like we're fighting
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:44:59.560]   with each other, cats and dogs.
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:03.280]   And finally, the sexual tension clearly was so thick
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:04.720]   you could cut it with a knife.
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:07.080]   And we came up with geometric marginalism,
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:09.880]   which is this other theory, not geometric unity,
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:13.880]   which allowed me to inhabit space
[02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:18.120]   with somebody who I already knew intimately
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:20.160]   and had fallen in love with,
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:22.800]   and to see the quality and beauty of their mind
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:23.860]   and to play and to dance.
[02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:26.540]   It's sort of the intellectual version of the tango.
[02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:30.360]   One of the most romantic periods of my life
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:33.680]   that doesn't fall into most people's experience.
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:37.000]   That was a chance to see something totally unexpected.
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:38.300]   Haven't really had it since
[02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:41.000]   because she doesn't wanna revisit the material,
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:42.800]   but something I'm super grateful for
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:44.560]   that's very particular and unique.
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:47.360]   - But to flip the tables on you
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:51.920]   for hundreds of thousands, I think millions of people,
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:57.520]   I can speak, me and them are really grateful.
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:02.520]   One, that you exist, and two, sorry for your podcast.
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:08.880]   And I do hope your voice in some form continues
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:12.880]   to reverberate, I think,
[02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:16.640]   in the, at least in the 2021s and beyond.
[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:19.840]   Even if it takes a brief pause.
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:21.600]   - We're pausing at the moment.
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:25.000]   We've recorded some for future episodes
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:26.440]   and I'm recording for you.
[02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:27.600]   I really appreciate that.
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:32.600]   I mean, it's, earnestness trades at a discount at the moment
[02:46:32.600 --> 02:46:34.480]   because it's easy to make fun of it.
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:36.040]   And one of the things I like best about you
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:38.440]   is that you and I are both fairly earnest.
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:41.800]   We may joke and jab, but honestly,
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:44.940]   there's a project here and a world to win, as they say.
[02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:49.940]   The thing that I want my and your listeners to know
[02:46:49.940 --> 02:46:54.160]   is that I'm not stepping away from the podcast
[02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:58.800]   because I don't appreciate that people really want more.
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:01.000]   It's not, you know,
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.440]   this is hugely financially costly to me.
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:07.320]   I want to make sure you guys are getting
[02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:09.720]   the best that I can do.
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:14.600]   And destroying myself right in front of an election,
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:16.080]   I think Lex is incorrect.
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:19.220]   I think that the forces that are trying to make sure
[02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:20.880]   that there aren't any planes in the sky
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:23.640]   that aren't either colored red or colored blue
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:29.000]   is a big danger given how angry I am at the system.
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:30.960]   And I don't want to be removed from the chessboard
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:32.960]   because if nobody's going to talk about Jeff Epstein,
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:33.880]   there need to be people.
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:36.040]   If nobody's going to talk about various things
[02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:38.160]   that we've talked about on these programs,
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:39.840]   I want to make sure that I'm there.
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:41.200]   Do I think that this is potentially
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:42.320]   an existential election?
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:43.160]   Yes.
[02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:44.840]   Am I positive that I know that my way to bed
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:45.860]   is the right way out?
[02:47:45.860 --> 02:47:47.460]   No, I'm not.
[02:47:47.460 --> 02:47:48.460]   I don't know, people.
[02:47:48.460 --> 02:47:49.540]   I just don't know.
[02:47:49.540 --> 02:47:52.440]   And where we are right now seems so dumb
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:55.400]   and so catastrophic in terms of how it is
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:59.940]   chewing up smart people that I decided,
[02:47:59.940 --> 02:48:01.380]   it's really not about cowardice
[02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:04.320]   because it's hard for me to restrain myself.
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:06.280]   I have so many reactions every day.
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:10.580]   This is really about trying to plan for all of our futures
[02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:12.360]   to make sure that I'm around.
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:14.340]   I had a huge concern that what happened
[02:48:14.340 --> 02:48:17.480]   to Brett's articles of unity was going to happen to Brett.
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:19.420]   It's going to happen to the YouTube channels.
[02:48:19.420 --> 02:48:21.480]   I want to make sure that we don't have all of our eggs
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:22.760]   in one basket.
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:25.040]   So if something goes wrong over there,
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:27.000]   that's the whole idea of the intellectual dark web,
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:30.960]   which is at some level a loose confederation.
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:32.780]   It can become a strong confederation
[02:48:32.780 --> 02:48:35.160]   if somebody wants to back it and make it work.
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:38.820]   It can dissolve so that there really isn't anything.
[02:48:38.820 --> 02:48:42.280]   The thing is to be hard to kill
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:46.040]   because ultimately when the hit pieces come,
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:47.440]   they don't come for what it is
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:48.640]   that they're angry at you about.
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:51.440]   They come for where they can get you.
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:53.360]   And so it's very important that right in front
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:58.360]   of an election, yeah, I think that the desire
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:01.720]   of the old system to defend itself
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:03.840]   through reputational destruction
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:07.180]   is one of the most pernicious aspects of the new America.
[02:49:07.180 --> 02:49:11.200]   And we have to fight the ability to destroy reputations
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:14.540]   as a means of institutions keeping individuals
[02:49:14.540 --> 02:49:16.880]   with podcasts and the ability to reach millions
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:20.360]   like through Substack out of their domain.
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:22.360]   I don't surrender this domain to them.
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:25.760]   They have plenty of weaponry with which to fight us.
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:27.920]   And I believe that they could remove you or me
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:28.760]   in an instant.
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:31.600]   By the end of today, if they wanted us off the chessboard,
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:33.040]   we would be off the chessboard.
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:34.900]   I know that's not your perspective.
[02:49:34.900 --> 02:49:38.160]   My goal is to stay here as long as possible
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:40.240]   to make sure that you have enough
[02:49:40.240 --> 02:49:42.520]   of a counterbalancing set of ideas
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:46.280]   and to let and help other podcasters start.
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:50.100]   And my hope is that that works.
[02:49:50.100 --> 02:49:54.120]   But long heroism, short martyrdom
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:56.480]   is a good motto for anyone.
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:49:59.480]   And I try to remember the short martyrdom part of that.
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:02.840]   - First of all, beautifully put.
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:05.160]   Second of all, a way to end a conversation
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:08.440]   and a disagreement, which is how you hook them
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:11.160]   for the next conversation to be continued.
[02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:12.400]   - When Lex says.
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:15.280]   - Eric, it's a huge honor.
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:16.960]   Thank you once again.
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:18.960]   - Lex, really appreciate every time we get together.
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:20.480]   Thanks, buddy.
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:21.920]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:23.160]   with Eric Weinstein.
[02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:25.240]   And thank you to our sponsors.
[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:27.780]   Grammarly, a service I use in my writing
[02:50:27.780 --> 02:50:30.200]   to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:31.600]   and readability.
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:34.400]   Sunbasket, a meal delivery service I use
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:37.680]   to add healthy variety into my culinary life.
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:41.760]   SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:43.440]   I've ever come across.
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:46.360]   I don't like looking at numbers, but someone should.
[02:50:46.360 --> 02:50:48.540]   It helps you make good decisions.
[02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:52.880]   And finally, ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years
[02:50:52.880 --> 02:50:55.840]   to protect my privacy on the internet.

[02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:14.600]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:51:14.600 --> 02:51:19.320]   from Leonard Cohen in a song titled "Hallelujah".
[02:51:19.320 --> 02:51:21.780]   Well, maybe there's a God above,
[02:51:21.780 --> 02:51:24.120]   but all I've ever learned from love
[02:51:24.120 --> 02:51:26.800]   was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.
[02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:30.480]   And it's not a cry that you hear at night.
[02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:32.880]   It's not somebody who's seen the light.
[02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:36.120]   It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:40.960]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:43.540]   (upbeat music)
[02:51:43.540 --> 02:51:46.120]   (upbeat music)
[02:51:46.120 --> 02:51:56.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
