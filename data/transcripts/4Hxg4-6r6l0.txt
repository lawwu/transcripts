[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.880]   - John Piper is back, joining us again
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.680]   outside the studio and over the telephone.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.600]   And today we have a really great question
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.560]   from a listener named David in Nashville.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.120]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.040]   You've said that steeping yourself in
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.500]   and meditating on God's promises
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.560]   is one of the primary ways we can experience
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.040]   abiding joy in Him.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.120]   So what are some of God's promises in the Bible
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.560]   that you have treasured most throughout your life?
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.520]   And why?
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.800]   - Let me answer this in three stages
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.200]   that more or less correspond to three stages of my life.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.960]   Although they really do overlap.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.960]   As I guess the first one lasts my whole life
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.160]   and the second one lasts my whole life
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.880]   and the third one, so they kind of overlap
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.280]   but they have different starting places.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.600]   My memory of my childhood isn't good enough
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.300]   to recall which verses were most,
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.560]   which promises were most special to me
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.440]   in my teenage years or earlier.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.520]   I look in the Bible that my parents gave me
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.920]   when I was 15 and I see heavily underlined
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.560]   in red pencil certain passages.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.640]   So I know God was speaking to me as a teenager
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.320]   and helping me by His word,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.600]   but my memory is just not good enough
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.140]   to remember that experience.
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.440]   But in my early 20s,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.900]   one verse took on monumental proportions
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.900]   and nothing has dislodged it from its primary place
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.700]   to this very day in my fight against sin,
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.200]   encouragement of my heart,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.700]   carrying through challenges in ministry
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.180]   and that is Isaiah 41 verse 10.
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.500]   "Fear not for I," this is God talking,
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.500]   "I am with you, be not dismayed for I am your God.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.780]   I will strengthen you, I will help you,
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.780]   I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.000]   So let me mention three things about this promise
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.400]   to show how it became so central
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.100]   and why it's so repeatedly helpful to this very day
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.800]   after thousands of applications.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   In July of 1971, I was about to get on an airplane
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.400]   and fly with Noel to Germany
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.920]   to begin my doctoral studies at age 25.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.620]   I'm sure Isaiah 41 10 had been functional
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.480]   in my life before that time,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.100]   but that day I received a phone call from my father
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.500]   who couldn't be there to see me off
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.720]   and he wanted to send me off with the promise of God
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.140]   and he recited on the phone Isaiah 41 10
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.200]   and then prayed that God would make it real in my life.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.160]   The effect of that phone call was to nail this promise
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.300]   into the scaffolding of my brain
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.960]   so firmly that it has become my go-to promise
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   more than any other.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.420]   In those very anxious times in Germany
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.440]   where everything felt fragile and uncertain
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.660]   and unknown and threatening,
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.060]   I resorted to this promise hundreds of times.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.400]   So this promise has a special place
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.640]   in the arsenal of my spiritual warfare,
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.820]   partly because my father put it there.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.660]   But the reason it is so effective
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.240]   is because unlike many promises,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   God himself is speaking as an I to me personally.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.140]   It doesn't say God will strengthen you,
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.320]   God will help you, God will uphold you.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.360]   That would be wonderful.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.200]   And many promises are spoken that way and they're wonderful.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.460]   But what it says is, I will strengthen you,
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.180]   I will help you and I will uphold you.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.280]   So when I recite this promise in my brain
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.260]   by an act of faith,
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.260]   I actually hear the living God saying to me,
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.300]   I will help you.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.780]   Spurgeon used to say,
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.780]   I love the I wills and I shalls of God.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.820]   I know exactly what he means.
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.820]   It's a wonderful thing to hear that God will help you.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.480]   Like Romans 8, 28,
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.800]   God will work everything together for you.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.400]   It's just off the charts glorious,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.360]   but it's better, it's better
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   to have God in his own words say, I will help you.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.760]   Isaiah 41, 10 is especially valuable also
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.400]   because those three verbs, I will strengthen,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.800]   I will help, I will uphold,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.380]   those three verbs correspond to every challenge
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.680]   that we can face.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.640]   Strength when we're weak and inadequate,
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.200]   help of whatever kind we need,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.880]   upholding when we feel threatened and opposed
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.240]   and beat down or knocked down.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.240]   These are awesome verbs that God addresses to our own soul.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.560]   It is an amazing promise and it's true, it comes true.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.280]   And there's a third reason why this promise is so precious.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.960]   Even though it is addressed to Israel
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.000]   in the Old Testament context,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I know because of 2 Corinthians 1, 20
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.520]   and because of the blood of Christ
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.320]   and because of my membership in the new covenant by faith
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   that all the promises of God are yes for me in Christ Jesus.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.420]   That's what 2 Corinthians 1, 20 says.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.420]   All the promises of God are yes in Christ Jesus.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.940]   So I don't worry that it was addressed to Israel.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.020]   I know that I am part of the new Israel in Christ
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.300]   and the promises are all the more,
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.300]   all the more true for me because of him.
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.180]   Then second stage, somewhere along the way,
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.280]   Romans 8, 32 became very, very prominent
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.920]   in my spiritual warfare.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.940]   He who did not spare his own son,
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.700]   but gave him up for us all,
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.700]   how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.220]   Now, Romans 8, 28 had always been large for me,
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.460]   but verse 32 does something more.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.300]   It does something in addition to verse 28.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.720]   It includes all the glorious promise of 8, 28.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.240]   Everything's gonna work together for my good.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.080]   He's gonna give me everything.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.160]   He's gonna give me everything, everything I need
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.680]   in this life, everything I could possibly want
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.720]   in the life to come.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   He's going to give me that and it provides the foundation,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   the unshakable foundation of why he will,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.660]   which is what gives this promise extraordinary power.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.660]   I've called it the unshakable logic of heaven.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.260]   Since God did not spare his own son,
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.780]   but did for us the absolutely unthinkable hardest
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.700]   of all things in not sparing his son,
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.720]   human torture and hellish condemnation,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.400]   since God did not spare his son any of that,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.260]   therefore, therefore, therefore, therefore,
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.620]   this is the logic of heaven,
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.780]   therefore, nothing can stop God
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.720]   from giving us everything with him.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.640]   How shall he not with him freely give us all things?
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.940]   Nothing can stop him.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.780]   He will give us all things.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.740]   Everything we need in this life to do his will
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.940]   or glorify his name and everything in the life to come
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.480]   that will enable us to know him fully
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.740]   and enjoy him perfectly and fully.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.740]   So Romans 8, 32, you might say,
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.220]   is the most prominent promise in my heart,
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.500]   which provides at the same time,
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.500]   the deepest foundation for all the promises.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.140]   And I should mention one last phase or cluster of texts
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.780]   that became very precious during my pastoral ministry,
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.260]   namely the promise of Jesus,
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.060]   I'll be with you always to the end of the age, Matthew 28, 20
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.180]   and the promise of Philippians 4, 19,
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.420]   my God will supply every need of yours
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.620]   according to his riches in glory in Christ.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.460]   And second Corinthians 9, 8,
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.460]   God is able to make all grace abound to you
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.980]   so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times,
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.100]   you may abound in every good work.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.420]   I think that little cluster,
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.700]   I think those became increasingly precious in the ministry
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.860]   because there's so many pressures,
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.300]   there's so many good works required of us in the ministry.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.180]   We wonder if we will have the wherewithal
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.040]   to do what we're expected to do.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.960]   And these promises all say, yes, we will,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.240]   God will see to it.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.240]   So just one, maybe one closing word of advice.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:58.480]   I think it is good to memorize a handful of promises
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.680]   like these that are gloriously general enough
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.480]   to apply in every situation
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.200]   so that you can always call them to mind
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.400]   no matter what your situation for encouragement
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.780]   and protection and strength.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.720]   But I think it is also good every morning
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.080]   to be reading through our Bibles,
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   looking for fresh expressions of God's faithfulness,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.660]   looking for fresh promises of God
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.640]   that we can take out of the text with us through that day
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.400]   as a particular appointed word of God for that day.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.360]   It has been amazing in my life
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.720]   to watch how those promises that were appointed
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.960]   for my reading in the morning and for my soul
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.880]   have become appointed in ministry
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.120]   for the people I meet during the day.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.120]   So hold fast to your Isaiah 41.10 for every situation
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.980]   and be learning every day fresh expressions
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.140]   of that same faithfulness.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.360]   - Man, that's incredibly helpful and hope-giving
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.220]   to hear how those texts have influenced your life.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.880]   And Romans 8.32 is one of the most incredible passages
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.700]   in the Bible.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.000]   I would just encourage you to really get a hold
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.620]   of this solid logic of heaven.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.120]   And to do so, see John Piper's 2012 sermon,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.800]   which you can find by Googling the title,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.380]   quote, "The Solid Logic of Heaven Holds," end quote.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.640]   That's where the penny dropped for me
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.540]   when I heard that sermon.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.000]   So get a hold of Romans 8.32,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.600]   or rather, let Romans 8.32 get a hold of you,
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.800]   and you'll never be the same.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.080]   Over at our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastor.

[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.320]   with a little tiny question
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.360]   over what's the point of my life?
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.040]   Yeah, what's the point of you and me?
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.760]   Why do we exist?
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.400]   I mean, what more are you looking for in a podcast, really?
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.120]   Have a great weekend.

[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:33.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
