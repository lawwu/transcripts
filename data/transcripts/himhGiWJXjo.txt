[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   SRABH SINGH:
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:14.100]   Cool.
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.020]   I'd originally titled this talk,
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.320]   "Connect real-time data to your AI," et cetera, et cetera.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.960]   But really, it's more existential, right?
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080]   The AI overlords are coming for us.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.400]   And to help them be good rulers, to help us,
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.960]   let's just give them the data they need
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.880]   so that they can do a good job, right?
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.820]   Hopefully, this talk is going to be the simplest talk
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.840]   that you heard at this conference.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.560]   If it's not, I'll go back to using GPT-4 for coding
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.280]   instead of Sonnet.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.640]   But the real pain that I have as I work with LLMs
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.840]   is that they can ride a flappy bird for me with my face going up
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.280]   and down in 30 seconds.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.980]   But they can't talk to my data intelligently.
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.220]   It's really stupid.
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.160]   If I want to connect it to my calendar and I just
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.040]   want to say, how many one-on-ones did I have last week?
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.500]   What's a good number to have with my team given their roles?
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.800]   Help me stagger them better and plan it out.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.260]   I want to connect it to my sales force and say, why is this deal
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.160]   with Acme stuck in stage three?
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.600]   And I needed to do the right thing.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.100]   I needed to figure out the things between stage two and stage three
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.300]   in my sales pipeline and tell me why that particular deal is blocked.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.140]   I wanted to connect to my tickets and my product data and say,
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.060]   is this ticket from an enterprise customer?
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.680]   What's the name of their project?
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.380]   Can you tell me what the status of that project is and what part of the product funnel this project is in?
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.080]   I went to Amazon today in the morning and they have this Rufus thing.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.580]   And I was like, OK, cool.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.080]   Is this product - I'm going to tell you what that product is in a second -
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.080]   but is this product available for one-day delivery at my Harrison Street address?
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.780]   And just doesn't - like, what is this, right?
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.480]   Like, it's right here.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.080]   Just do it.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.780]   And it doesn't work.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.080]   And you all know why it doesn't work, right?
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.180]   There's like a death by a thousand cuts and it's not secure,
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.380]   and I don't want to connect my calendar and make it into a GPT.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.480]   Who even knows what the GPT is doing with this, right?
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.180]   Like, it's scary, and it doesn't work.
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.980]   So we solved this with a pretty simple idea,
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.680]   which is that you take your live data and business logic
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.180]   and you make that available as a tool to your LLM.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.980]   No shit.
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.480]   It's not surprising, right?
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.880]   It's easy.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.180]   Because - and we did a bunch of things -
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.180]   that makes it work really, really well, right?
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.180]   Let's see if you have time for a quick live demo here.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.380]   Let me see if I'm connected to the internet, which I am.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.880]   All right.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880]   I'm going to zoom this up.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.380]   All right.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:13.380]   So I am a blockbuster because, obviously,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.580]   services businesses are the most important businesses now,
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.580]   and, like, movie streaming businesses
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.180]   are going to go nowhere in the AI world that is to come.
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.880]   And so, in my blockbuster database and transactions
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   and all of this stuff that I have going on,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.380]   I want to ask my data question and say,
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:36.580]   "What helped me write an email to my top customer,
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.080]   thanking them for their patronage?"
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   Quote, mention some recent movies they watched, right?
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.580]   Straightforward request.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.780]   "I have all this data.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.280]   I just needed to do the right things.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.280]   And I needed to write an email for me."
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280]   Right?
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.780]   And it works.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.780]   And it works despite the fact that it's going to two or three
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.280]   different places and getting data from them.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   And it works pretty well.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   It handles all kinds of situations.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   And I'm going to talk to you about three key ideas
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   about how it works,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   and hopefully that's going to be useful to you as well.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:25.980]   So, the first is this idea of a unified query language.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.480]   Whether you're talking to structured data,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.780]   or unstructured data, or APIs,
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.780]   what if your LLM could talk to everything the same way?
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.780]   Right?
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.080]   LLMs don't know what your API is.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.280]   If you're a little honest with yourselves,
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.780]   you probably don't know what your API does.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.280]   But LLMs know what SQL is.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.880]   Right?
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.680]   Because when you say select star from x where id greater than 1,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.080]   greater than has a semantic meaning
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.980]   that is embedded in the language.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.680]   That in your API, that URL param, who knows what it means?
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.180]   Is it greater than, is it greater than, equal to?
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.080]   Is it greater than, but actually only works with Boolean?
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.880]   I don't know, right?
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.780]   But it works with SQL.
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.980]   Because LLMs know what that SQL is, right?
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.080]   So the first part of this is, let's just make everything
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.480]   one query language and deal with that.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.480]   The second is an object model for authorization, right?
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.780]   Which is, again, kind of blows my mind of why it's so complicated.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.880]   Look, I don't care where the data is coming from.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.980]   The data has a schema, right?
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.380]   It's a property of the data, and it's a property of the session.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.880]   And then just run the rule.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.280]   And maybe there's 100 rules, but it should just work.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.180]   And then however it gets accessed, it's fine, right?
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.280]   I should be able to use this wherever it's used.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.880]   However it's accessed, the same authorization should be applied.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.180]   So that's idea number two.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.180]   And that's kind of embedded there as well.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.280]   The third, and this is kind of interesting,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.480]   is to get the LLM to figure out the plan to access data by itself.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.780]   We don't have to hard code it, and we don't have to do the work.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.680]   And then you're like, Tanmay, listen, what are you smoking, man?
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.980]   LLMs can't even reason.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.280]   I can't even get it to count the number of Rs in strawberry.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.480]   What are you going to do with--
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.480]   how are you going to make me fetch all of this data
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.580]   from three or four different places in DeSambuay and whatnot?
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.780]   And we're like, you know what?
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.380]   There's a really simple fix to this problem.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.780]   But let me ask you a live question.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.880]   How many of you can count the number of I's in supercalifragilisticexpialidocious?
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.680]   Can you?
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.380]   You can't, right?
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.880]   You're being mean to the LLM by asking it such questions.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.580]   Don't be mean to the LLM.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.280]   Set it up for success.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.480]   Ask it to write Python code to solve the problem, and it works.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.780]   And that's it.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.980]   So when you're asking, and when we're asking our LLMs to figure out how to retrieve data,
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.880]   we just ask it to run Python code to fetch the data that we want.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:38.980]   So if the AI singularity is coming, get ready for the data singularity.
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.580]   Put everything together.
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.480]   If you're doing AI, you need access to data.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   If you're doing data and you wish that it could talk to your AI,
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.180]   if you have AI and data and you need to get to talk to each other,
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.380]   come visit us at our booth.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.280]   Everything's in the open at hasura/pasture.ai.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.280]   Talk to you folks soon.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.280]   Thank you for your time.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.080]   Bye.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.080]   Bye.

[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.080]   Bye.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.680]   Bye.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.880]   Bye.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:56.880]   Bye.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.180]   Bye.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.780]   Bye.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.080]   Bye.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.580]   Bye.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.580]   Bye.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.580]   Bye.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.580]   Bye.
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.080]   Bye.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.580]   Bye.
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.080]   Bye.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.580]   Bye.
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.080]   Bye.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.580]   Bye.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.580]   Bye.
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.580]   Bye.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.280]   We'll see you next time.
