[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.520]   - Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.440]   Just a scheduling note before we begin today.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.680]   You may remember three years ago, almost three years ago,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.400]   we recorded a handful of episodes live.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.520]   We recorded them at the Getty Worship Conference
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.360]   in Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.240]   It was a great time.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.880]   We had an hour together,
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.320]   and I think about 2,000 or so of you showed up on site
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.280]   for that event, and we're gonna do it again in one month.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.560]   Again, at the SING Global 2022 Conference,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.640]   and again in Nashville.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.280]   Our live recording is a breakout session,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.440]   and I think it's currently scheduled
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680]   for the afternoon of September 6th,
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.600]   at Tuesday, I believe, at 1.30 p.m. local time in Nashville.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.880]   We would love to see you there,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.320]   and I would love to meet you there if time permits.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.160]   So keep that date on your calendar.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.000]   And so why does the Bible tell us
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.960]   not to be overly righteous?
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.780]   That's today's question, a sharp one,
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.080]   from a perplexed Bible reader and a pastor named Aaron.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.400]   Hello, Pastor John, can you explain two texts to me?
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.000]   The first is this one.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.280]   Be not overly righteous,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.080]   which we read in Ecclesiastes 7.16,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.760]   and square that with Peter's lofty command.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.720]   As he who called you is holy,
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.120]   you also be holy in all your conducts.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.200]   Since it is written, you shall be holy, for I am holy.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.000]   That's 1 Peter 1, 15 to 16.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.000]   What would it mean to be overly righteous?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.360]   Is the ESV translation accurate here?
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.700]   Here's a little background story.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.240]   I was laughing at a crude joke, and I caught myself,
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.800]   and I turned and said to my Christian friend
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.200]   that I feel guilty for laughing at it.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.840]   He said to me, "Well, doesn't the Bible say
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.260]   "not to be overly righteous?
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.800]   "I think a little guilty laughing is fine," he said.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.960]   He was right about the text,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.720]   but this statement didn't sit well with me.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.720]   How did these two texts hold together
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.680]   in your own mind, Pastor John?
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.400]   - I'm glad it didn't sit well with him.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.200]   It doesn't sit well with me either.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.520]   You know, my first thought when I heard this question was,
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.120]   I should not try to answer this question,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   because I'm not sure what Ecclesiastes means
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.040]   in chapter seven, verse 15 through 18.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.840]   I remember over the years
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.440]   returning to these puzzling verses several times
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.220]   and coming away each time with all my efforts
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.820]   to read the commentaries and do the work in Hebrew,
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.960]   coming away saying, "Well, maybe."
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.200]   (both laughing)
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.840]   Maybe I've got it, but frankly, I'm still not sure.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.880]   So my second thought was,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.400]   well, at least I should admit that publicly,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.040]   and I should make the difficult effort, I think,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.920]   because there are a lot of verses in Ecclesiastes
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.240]   that I'm not sure about.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.080]   The whole book is a little bit of a puzzle to me.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.400]   But I think in all fairness, I should give it a try
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   so that we all have at least one plausible interpretation,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.200]   even if we may not be sure it's the only right one.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.160]   So here are the verses.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.840]   In my vain life, I have seen everything.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness,
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.200]   and there's a wicked man
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.240]   who prolongs his life in his evil doing.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.840]   Be not overly righteous.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.580]   Do not make yourself too wise.
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.540]   Why should you destroy yourself?
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.040]   Be not overly wicked.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.000]   Neither be a fool.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.200]   Why should you die before your time?
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.080]   It is good that you should take hold of this,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.480]   and from that withhold not your hand,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.640]   for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.320]   My, my, my.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.160]   Now, without any context,
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.000]   and without any sense of what this author says elsewhere
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.800]   about righteousness and wickedness,
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.340]   I suppose you could say that these verses mean,
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.440]   well, be a little bit unrighteous.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.520]   You know, tell a few dirty jokes.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.640]   Laugh a little bit at the sinfulness
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.960]   that you see on the screen,
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.560]   and be a little bit wicked.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.520]   Be a little bit unwise.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.560]   I suppose you could say, well, that's what they say.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.360]   It must mean that.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.120]   But that would fly right in the face,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.400]   not only of the teachings of Jesus and the apostles
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.000]   who told us that our righteousness
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.040]   better exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees,
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.040]   or we're not gonna enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.500]   Matthew 5:20, and be holy,
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.780]   because your father in heaven is holy, 1 Peter 1:16.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.140]   It also flies in the face
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.220]   of what the writer of Ecclesiastes himself says,
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.440]   because he ends his book like this.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.340]   "The end of the matter, all has been heard.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.140]   Fear God and keep his commandments,
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.220]   for this is the whole duty of man."
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.220]   And he adds this, "For God will bring every deed
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.300]   into judgment with every secret thing,
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.140]   whether good or evil."
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.420]   In other words, he does not encourage,
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.020]   just a little bit, a little bit of disobedience,
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.820]   maybe just one or two commandments,
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.020]   just a white lie kind of disobedience.
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.620]   It's not what he says.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.820]   In fact, he says, "Every deed will be brought
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.820]   into judgment, every secret thing will be found out."
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.180]   These are not the words of a man
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.180]   who thinks it is prudent to lighten up on our vigilance
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.820]   over the fullness of our obedience to God.
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.820]   So the entire Bible, plus the context of Ecclesiastes itself,
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.140]   warns us not to think he is teaching us
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.100]   to be a little bit wicked, a little bit unrighteous,
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.500]   a little bit unwise.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.060]   So we stand back and we say,
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.060]   "Well, what on earth does it mean then?"
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.060]   The verse 16 says, "Be not overly righteous
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.140]   and do not make yourself too wise.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.060]   Why should you destroy yourself?"
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.700]   Now, what if I paraphrased it like this?
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.260]   "Do not be greatly righteous,
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.260]   do not be righteous with the aim of great righteousness,
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.660]   and do not become bloated with wisdom."
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.780]   What would you hear in that paraphrase?
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.660]   Well, what you can hear in that paraphrase is my sense
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.140]   that what he's getting at here is not a warning
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:10.140]   against true righteousness and true unwisdom or wickedness,
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:16.060]   or not warning against avoiding wickedness, true wickedness,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.340]   but against a kind of righteousness that is excessive
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.660]   or great in the sense of being fastidious
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.940]   or lopsided or showy.
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.220]   And as soon as I say that,
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.220]   I can't help but hear in my own words, the words of Jesus.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.780]   And maybe that's why I'm thinking it up
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.980]   'cause those words are tucked away at the back of my mind,
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.980]   the words of Jesus regarding
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.140]   the kind of distorted righteousness,
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.820]   perhaps he would say excessive righteousness
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.820]   of the scribes and the Pharisees.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.020]   For example, Matthew 23, 23,
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.340]   "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.820]   you tithe, mint, and dill, and cumin,
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.500]   and have neglected the weightier matters of the law,
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.420]   justice, and mercy, and faithfulness.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.400]   These you ought to have done without neglecting the others.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.020]   You blind guides, straining out a gnat
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.720]   and swallowing a camel."
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.100]   It's not a stretch, is it?
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.460]   To call this over much righteousness
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:31.200]   or excessive righteousness in an ironic way,
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.660]   righteousness that is super vigilant,
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.540]   over tithing every spice in the spice drawer,
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:42.140]   but neglectful of justice and mercy and faithfulness.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.340]   We all get this.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.780]   We use language this way.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.780]   Jesus could have easily said with Ecclesiastes,
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.300]   "Be not overly righteous."
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.300]   That is, don't make yourself too wise
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.740]   because there is a kind of fastidious,
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.180]   lopsided, showy righteousness and wisdom
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.760]   that God abominates.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.020]   So I don't think the point of Ecclesiastes
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.420]   is that we should be a little bit unrighteous
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.100]   or a little bit unwise,
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.100]   but rather that we should not become so preoccupied
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.680]   with the minor aspects of righteousness
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.940]   that we neglect the major aspects,
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:35.260]   nor should we become so caught up in clever casuistry
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.420]   to justify our blind spots,
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.740]   like the Pharisees who had all kinds of ways worked out
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.080]   to do the kind of little bit of unrighteousness
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.020]   that they wanted to do.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.940]   And then in verse 17,
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.420]   to parallel what he has just said in verse 16,
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.420]   Ecclesiastes says, "Be not overly wicked,
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.540]   "neither be a fool.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.940]   "Why should you die before your time?"
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.500]   I can't help but think that he provided
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.860]   this audacious parallel to being overly righteous
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.680]   in order to draw out how wrong it would be
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:26.180]   to interpret the previous verse any other way than ironic.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.400]   It's just over the top, I think,
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.800]   to think he would be saying something like,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:39.500]   "Just be a fool, solid, wicked person, not excessive.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:45.580]   "Just fool, solid, normal, wicked, just be that."
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.220]   It's crazy, I mean, just you cannot believe
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.460]   that this writer is saying that.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.840]   And I think he expects us to say,
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.540]   "Don't you see this is irony in the way I'm saying this?"
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.200]   So instead, I think he's saying something like,
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:06.060]   "Look, if you get the idea that the pendulum should swing
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:12.180]   "from overmuch righteousness to overmuch wickedness,
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.800]   "don't even begin to think that you can lengthen your life
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.240]   "by being a standout villain,
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.940]   "a villain who isn't just your average run-of-the-mill
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.940]   "villain, don't even begin to think that I'm suggesting
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:32.100]   "that you should be an overmuch wicked person.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:37.920]   "It won't work, you can't save your life by being that way."
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.040]   And then at the end of that clause, he simply says,
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.440]   "Don't be a fool."
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.620]   And the reason that stands out is because he does not say,
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.480]   "Don't be an overmuch fool,"
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.220]   or "Don't be an excessive fool."
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.400]   He said that about righteousness,
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.380]   he said that about wickedness,
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.160]   he doesn't say it about fool.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.700]   And I think it's his way of saying,
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.640]   "Hey, do you get what I've been saying?
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.980]   "Only a fool would miss what I'm saying."
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.380]   By thinking I'm commending a little bit of unrighteousness,
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.600]   a little bit of wickedness.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.780]   But just a couple of cautions here at the end
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.300]   about difficult passages of scripture,
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.100]   because this is one.
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.100]   First, let the things that are clear in scripture
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.820]   control your thinking,
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.100]   rather than the things that are unclear.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.020]   You have a lifetime to get more clarity
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.860]   on the hard passages,
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.880]   but obedience is called for this afternoon, today.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.980]   And the second thing I would say is beware of those people
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.860]   that our friend referred to,
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.860]   beware of people who latch on to unclear texts
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.820]   to justify worldly behavior.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.400]   This is not the evidence of biblical wisdom
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.780]   or biblical righteousness.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.260]   - Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.

[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.540]   We are gonna break for the weekend
