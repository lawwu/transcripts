[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.440]   Today, our special guest is Jason Zweig.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.240]   Jason became a personal finance columnist for The Wall Street
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.920]   Journal in 2008.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.680]   Before joining the journal, Jason
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.400]   was a senior editor for Money magazine
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.320]   and a guest columnist for Time magazine and CNN.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.840]   And in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.320]   Jason was a mutual fund editor at Forbes.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.040]   He was also a researcher, reporter
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.760]   for the economy and business section of Time,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.480]   and an editorial assistant at African Report,
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.480]   a bi-monthly journal.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.200]   He's the author of several books--
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.760]   Your Money and Your Brain, The Devil's Financial Dictionary,
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.600]   The Little Book of Safe Money, and two editions
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.040]   of Benjamin Graham's classic, The Intelligent Investor,
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.800]   which we will be discussing on this podcast.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.040]   I first approached Jason to be a guest in 2019,
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.920]   and it has taken five years for him
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.560]   to get approval from his employer.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.720]   But here we are.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.880]   So with no further ado, let me welcome Jason Zweig.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   Welcome to Bogle Heads on Investing, Jason.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.320]   It's great to be with you, Rick.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.880]   And thank you for your extreme patience.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.080]   This took years.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.480]   And I'm delighted to be on the air with you.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.120]   I'm sure it will be worth the wait.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.720]   Well, we'll find out, won't we?
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.320]   You've been a friend of the Bogle Heads for a long, long time.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.680]   And we'll get to that in a few minutes.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.800]   But first, I'm absolutely fascinated
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.840]   by the stories you tell about working with your parents who
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.560]   were antique and art dealers.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.160]   My parents had been editors and publishers
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.840]   of weekly newspapers, first in Southern Ohio,
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.360]   along the Ohio River, and then in Connecticut,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.200]   along the Connecticut River.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.520]   And it got to be a grind.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.560]   And they got a little tired of working seven days a week.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.800]   And they had always been fascinated by history.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.200]   And they decided they would become dealers primarily
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.400]   in 18th century American furniture, also pottery
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.560]   and porcelain, paintings, and really anything
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.280]   that might have been in a colonial or federal home
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   in New England or the Middle Atlantic states
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.880]   at any time up until maybe Andrew Jackson was president.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.800]   And my parents were very well-educated, cultured,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.480]   sophisticated people.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.760]   But my dad had grown up on a farm in northern New York
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.280]   state.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.600]   And when they sold the newspaper in, I think it was 1965,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.680]   they decided that they would go back to the land.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.280]   And my parents bought a 120-acre farm
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.120]   in one of the most remote areas in the Northeast.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.280]   I grew up 18 miles from the nearest stoplight.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.200]   And they opened an art and antiques business.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.840]   And I helped them.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.160]   I worked in the business with them
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.240]   all the way through high school and on my college vacations.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.560]   And that meant lots of expeditions
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.280]   all across the Northeast looking for antiques at auctions
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.720]   and shows and flea markets and people's backyards
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.160]   and knocking on doors.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.040]   And it was a fascinating way to grow up.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.000]   It sure was.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   We have something in common from our youth
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.760]   that you probably don't know about.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.120]   Oddly enough, the way I put myself through college
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.920]   was doing as an antique dealer in New England.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.400]   I had no idea, Rick.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.120]   I went to auctions and flea markets and yard sales.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.800]   And not at the level, of course, that you and your parents.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.160]   But I would pick up clocks and restore them and art class.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.120]   And I would resell it at an antiques flea
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.640]   market in Rhode Island.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.000]   Wow, awesome.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.280]   I did that for many years.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.840]   Wow.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.440]   And so when you started telling these stories,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.400]   I just was fascinated.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   Like, wow, that was an interesting coincidence.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.680]   But I want to hear some of your real big finds.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.800]   Tell me about the church painting.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.160]   Yeah, so when I was in high school,
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.280]   guessing it was in the summer, my parents and I
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.440]   went to an estate sale at an old house
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.000]   somewhere near Schoharie, New York,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.080]   which is southwest of Albany.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.880]   And it was a big house.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.400]   And it was full of junk.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.200]   I mean, in the entire house, there
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.040]   wasn't one thing worth buying.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.840]   And my dad was a very smart guy.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.640]   But he had one cognitive flaw, which
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.960]   is he really suffered from sunk cost bias.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.680]   And he would not quit.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.480]   Because his principle was, if we make a buying trip,
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.640]   we're going to find something to buy.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.480]   Yeah, that's going to be dangerous in that business.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.200]   Exactly.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.400]   And my parents just kept going back and forth, up and down
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.720]   the stairs from room to room.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.960]   And I was like, there is nothing in this house.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.000]   And I'm not going to keep looking.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.800]   And I sat down on a couch in the living room of this house
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.280]   and leaned against the fireplace with this big painting.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.480]   And it was a nasty looking thing.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.800]   The painting was so dirty that you couldn't even
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.920]   tell what it was a painting of.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.320]   And I was bored.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.280]   And I knew my parents weren't going to finish any time soon.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.120]   So I had nothing to do but sort of stare at the painting.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.880]   Then as I was looking at it, something
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.560]   occurred to me, which is it was in a big, fancy, gilded frame.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.800]   Gilded, meaning gold.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.960]   They were very expensive back then.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.680]   Exactly.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.760]   And this had obviously come down from the attic,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.600]   obviously been in the attic of this house
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.040]   for the better part of a century, which
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.240]   is why it was so dirty.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.320]   There were wasps' nests in the frame.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.480]   And the whole thing was just a disgusting mess.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.320]   But as I sat there, I said, who would put a bad painting
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.840]   in a gilded frame?
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.640]   And I got up off the couch.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.520]   And I went over.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.080]   And I looked at it.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.680]   And it was a cloudy day.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.640]   And the shades were drawn.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.520]   And then I noticed the sun had come out.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.400]   So I went back to the window.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.720]   I pulled the shades back.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.680]   And the clouds sort of parted, coincidentally,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.440]   at that exact moment.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.480]   And a shaft of sunlight hit the canvas.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.840]   And I was like, wait a minute.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.720]   This is not a bad painting.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.840]   This is a good painting.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.400]   And I licked my thumb.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.320]   And I went where experience told me a good artist might
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.120]   sign a painting, ran my wet thumb across.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.960]   And there I saw F.E. Church, 1848.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.400]   And I jumped up.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.040]   And I ran up the steps.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.760]   And I grabbed my parents.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.280]   And I whispered to them, there's a church downstairs.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.440]   And they said, what?
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.200]   And I said, there's a church downstairs.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.760]   And suddenly, their eyes opened.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.080]   And I dragged them down the stairs.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.840]   And we took it to the window and looked at it.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.440]   And suddenly, you could really see the detail.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.680]   And we just put it right back where it was.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.240]   The auction was the next day.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.160]   And we bought it.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.640]   And we were very excited to get it.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.720]   I think we paid.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.240]   It was a couple thousand, because there
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.040]   was a guy who would follow my parents around to these auctions
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.400]   and bid them up.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.000]   And we took it home.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.080]   We cleaned it up.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.360]   A dealer from Washington DC came, saw it, and bought it
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.640]   from us on the spot.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.680]   And he turned around.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.720]   And he sold it to the White House.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.280]   And it ended up in the Oval Office.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.040]   It's an amazing story.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.200]   I want to do one more of these.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:23.440]   You also became a expert on old books and manuscripts
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.400]   from that period.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.160]   And you had created an indexing system for authors
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.720]   in first edition so that you could
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.920]   rummage through hundreds of books
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.600]   and find the one book in a pile of books
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.760]   that was worth something.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.640]   And you had the fortunate experience
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.080]   of finding a first edition of a Mark Twain book.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.000]   Yeah, so I want to tell this story, Rick,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.240]   in a way that doesn't make it sound as if I'm bragging.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.080]   Because believe me, I wish I could do this.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.440]   No, you could go ahead and brag.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.680]   OK.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.120]   Back then, I truly did have a photographic memory.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.080]   I could open a book.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.280]   And weeks later, I could tell you
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.640]   whether I read something on a left-hand or a right-hand page
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.600]   and almost recapitulate what it was word for word.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.480]   And what I did is I took the Columbia Encyclopedia, which
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.120]   we had at home, and I made index cards
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.880]   of every major American author, I guess, up until the 1920s,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.920]   probably stopped with Hemingway and Faulkner,
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.560]   and the dates when their books were first published.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.680]   And I put them all on index cards.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.320]   And from time to time, I would flip through them
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.080]   to refresh my memory.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.160]   And one day, we were at an auction
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.520]   in Glens Falls, New York.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.840]   And there was a big box of old books, again, super dusty.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.240]   And most of them were nothing.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.120]   But one of them, I could immediately tell from the date,
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.720]   was a first edition of Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.280]   and King Arthur's Court.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.440]   And it wasn't just a first edition,
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.120]   but it was a presentation copy.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.400]   It was the copy that the illustrator, Dan Beard,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.080]   had given to a handful of his friends
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.280]   that Christmas of the year the book came out.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.440]   And it had a Christmas card in it from Dan Beard.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.320]   And Beard was not only a great illustrator,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.760]   but he was also the founder of the American Boy Scouts.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.640]   And the book was spectacular.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.360]   It was bound in what's called Morocco leather.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.520]   It had these Florentine marbled end pages.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.120]   If you know how beautiful marbled paper can
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.040]   be, red and blue and brown and green.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.720]   And it had gilded edges to the pages.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.200]   I think we paid $20 for the entire box of books.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.280]   And we gave all the rest of the books away.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.760]   But that one was well worth keeping.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.600]   Fascinating.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.320]   I never had anything like that.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.360]   I had a lot of little wins of picking up
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.280]   original Bristol glass and cranberry glass
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.960]   from the 1800s, where people didn't know what it was
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.560]   and they'd be selling it for $1.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.440]   Awesome.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.440]   There is something that I want to talk about
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.280]   that ties this into investing.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.080]   I noticed something in the antique business
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.360]   is that there are trends.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.080]   There's momentum on certain things that can just end.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.040]   Exactly.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.240]   Take, for example, piano stools.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.120]   They were just so hot back in the 1970s
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.960]   that if you could get your hands on a piano
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:38.920]   stool that had the swivel kind and brass cloth feet,
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.360]   it was like gold.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.720]   And people were just buying them just
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.360]   because it was a piano stool.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.440]   Back then, if you could buy one for $20,
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.680]   you could sell it for $70, $80, or $100.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.640]   Well, it turns out, here we are 50 years later,
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.440]   they're selling for $60, $70.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.520]   I mean, it just stopped.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.480]   Yep, another one like that, lightning rod balls.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.600]   Do you remember this?
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.640]   Yep, I do.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.320]   For our listeners, old barns throughout the Northeast
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:17.680]   had a glass ball through which the lightning rods ran.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.400]   So at the top of the roof of a barn, you would look up,
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.520]   and you would typically see, I want
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.080]   to say, like three lightning rods.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.280]   Yeah, I think it was like small, medium, large, or something.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.480]   Yes, exactly.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.680]   And each lightning rod would have a glass ball on it
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.280]   that was typically sort of blue-green.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.080]   And they were all made in the 19th century,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.040]   and they were somewhat rare.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.200]   And these things were selling for hundreds of dollars
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.400]   a piece.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.280]   And today, I don't know what they're worth, a nickel maybe?
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.760]   Right.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.240]   Yeah, and then insulators for the early electricity
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.360]   and telegraph cables.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.720]   Yes, exactly.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.640]   People had to have these whenever they saw them,
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.520]   even though they didn't really know much about antiques.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.400]   And it was like, they knew that they needed to buy this.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:06.920]   Exactly.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.600]   And I remember Carnival Glass had its day as well.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.480]   They just bid these things up.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.080]   And you're looking at them going, this is ridiculous.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.720]   I don't know why these people are paying this kind of money.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.640]   I don't think they really know what they're doing.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.120]   Right.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.920]   But it happened to be the trend of the day.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.680]   And I see that a lot in the financial markets as well.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.600]   Totally, totally.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:30.040]   You know, when meme stocks came along in 2020 and 2021,
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.240]   I was like, wow, these are like lightning rod balls.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.520]   That's right.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.720]   You remember the coin frenzy that occurred?
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.880]   I think it was when the price of silver
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.120]   went up in the late 1970s.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.560]   And everybody was buying silver coins.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.480]   And the price of coins were going skyrocketing.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.200]   And then it died.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.840]   And that was it.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.600]   Exactly.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.400]   And I don't think it's ever come back.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.120]   Exactly.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.560]   Well, thank you for talking about that period.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.120]   Because to me, and trying to figure out who Jason Zweig is
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.160]   and why he writes the way he writes today
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.880]   and the things you talk about today,
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.160]   I always believe that your background, doing what you did,
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.720]   and the idea of value versus price,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.000]   something you wrote in the book, you know,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.800]   what most people think is treasure is, in fact, trash.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.920]   And what a lot of people think is trash is, in fact, treasure.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.800]   That influenced you to become the person and the journalist
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.320]   that you are today.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   Yeah, and I think that is true, Rick.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.040]   I know I was blessed in having a very unusual childhood.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.080]   One of my dad's principles was that often what people think
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.120]   is treasure is just trash.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.480]   And what they think is trash is treasure.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.800]   And I couldn't put it better.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.520]   It's really been kind of a guiding principle of mine
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.760]   throughout my writing career.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.160]   Because you see it in the financial markets
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.560]   as well as in something like art and antiques.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.240]   It's all around us.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.280]   You currently work at The Wall Street Journal,
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.040]   but you didn't start there.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.280]   Tell us about the journey you took to get there.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.040]   Even though I loved working in my parents' business,
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.600]   what I always wanted to be was a writer.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.520]   I was a farm boy in a cultured house.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.440]   And I was a close observer of nature around me.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.440]   And I always wanted to be a writer.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.880]   And when I got out of college, my novels weren't selling.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.080]   They weren't even writing themselves.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.040]   So I gave up on fiction.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.920]   Oh, I didn't know you had fiction books.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.880]   Yeah, I tried.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.240]   How many did you write?
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.080]   Well, I didn't finish any.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.000]   Oh, I see, I see.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.640]   But I tried.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.840]   I perpetrated a bunch of short stories
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.800]   and got probably a half dozen unfinished novels
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.640]   from my misspent youth.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.360]   Oh, interesting.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.440]   I didn't realize it at the time.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.120]   But I was a very avid writer.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.880]   But I had no life experience.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.520]   So I couldn't really write anything
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.120]   that was any good because I didn't know anything.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.840]   And if you haven't lived enough, you certainly
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.800]   can't write anything, any meaningful fiction, anyway.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.120]   So I just kind of stumbled into journalism.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.760]   I knew I wanted to write.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.000]   I didn't really want to be a journalist because my parents
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.600]   had done that.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.120]   And I wanted to try and be something different.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.480]   But it just kind of happened.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.000]   I sort of fell into it.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.920]   And I spent a couple of years doing
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.160]   different kinds of writing for a couple of different magazines.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.880]   And then I got picked up at Forbes, which then was
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.960]   certainly one of the three or four best business
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.880]   publications in the country.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.720]   They hired me to be a fact checker.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.200]   And even though fact checking sounds very mechanical and not
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.640]   very creative, you also, in your spare time,
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.840]   were expected to generate story ideas of your own.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:20.480]   And I really quickly found the business world fascinating.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.800]   There were just a million stories then
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.760]   because this was the late '80s.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.800]   And the financial markets were booming.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.200]   And there was all kinds of crazy stuff
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.960]   going on and great characters.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.200]   I found out that there were a bunch of IPOs for companies
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.480]   in the rabbit meat industry.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.520]   And the selling line that the brokers would use
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.280]   was it's the new chicken.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.640]   I remember that.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.720]   I do.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.000]   It's better for you.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.720]   It's more healthy.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.600]   And it tastes better.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.920]   And it's better for the environment.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.480]   And there were at least a half dozen rabbit meat companies
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.280]   that just, I guess I could say, hopped up out of nowhere.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.120]   And the next thing I knew, I was on a plane to Arkansas.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.320]   And then I spent a day in a rabbit meat packing plant
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.960]   watching these people, you know--
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.800]   Slaughter rabbits.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.920]   I mean, you could say it.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.800]   And at the risk of offending many of our listeners,
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.880]   I will say, yes, I did witness that.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.920]   And I just had so much fun.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.440]   I was like, this is what I want to do the rest of my life.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.680]   Not slaughter rabbits, but write.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.000]   But write about the crazy world of business and finance.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.920]   And then you ended up moving to Money magazine after that,
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:47.680]   where one of the articles that you wrote back in 2001
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.080]   was "Here Come the Bogleheads."
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.960]   So tell us how you got associated
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.520]   with the Bogleheads.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.520]   The internet was young then, as you and I, Rick,
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.280]   are old enough to remember.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.160]   You know, I don't think most people even got online
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.960]   until the late '90s.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.360]   And at the time I found the Bogleheads,
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.560]   the forum was called Vanguard Diehards.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.400]   And it was hosted on Morningstar.com.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.240]   And it quickly became the most active chat forum
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.200]   on Morningstar, which, of course,
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.000]   itself was a very popular destination for people looking
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.200]   to learn about investing online.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.160]   And I was quickly struck by, I guess I would say,
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.920]   the altruistic nature of the leading personalities
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.760]   on the forum.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.920]   Not just people whose names are very familiar
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.160]   to any Boglehead, like, you know,
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.760]   Mel Lindauer and Taylor Larimore,
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.520]   but dozens of other people, incredibly knowledgeable
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.440]   and almost selfless in the way they would devote time
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.000]   and effort and energy to answering
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.920]   other people's questions.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.880]   And it occurred to me that this was kind of a new kind
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.440]   of social phenomenon, that people were finding the kind
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:15.440]   of advice you used to get from a wise, older relative.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.320]   - Hmm, yeah, true.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.640]   It's a good analogy.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:23.000]   - Yeah, and so I went to the Bogleheads meeting,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.360]   which I think was the second one.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.200]   - It was.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.040]   - Yeah.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.200]   - Right outside of Melbourne and Pennsylvania.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.400]   And I think it was the second one they ever held.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.280]   The first one, I think, was in Taylor Larimore's apartment.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.280]   And I was just blown away by how nice these people were,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.920]   how well-informed they were,
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.760]   and how much they cared about each other.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.640]   And it was the first time I'd ever seen
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.920]   what we've all witnessed many times since,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.000]   which was people who had never met each other
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.560]   in the real world, but who felt they knew each other
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.920]   from being online together, meeting in person
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.960]   for the first time, and hugging each other,
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.080]   crying, laughing.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.240]   It was, I'll always remember that, that meeting,
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.080]   because it was really extraordinary.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.520]   It was kind of a combination
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.080]   of an old-time church revival meeting,
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   and maybe almost like a substance abuse meeting,
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.360]   because people stood up and said,
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.760]   my name is so-and-so, and I'm from this town,
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.920]   and I used to invest all wrong.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.600]   And then I discovered the Bogleheads,
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.880]   and now I've got it straight, and thank you so much.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.640]   And then they would start crying.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.480]   - Yeah.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.480]   - And I realized this is an incredibly special
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.640]   group of people who are doing something that's important.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.160]   And even though I think very few people
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.760]   outside the Bogleheads had ever heard of them
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.880]   at that point, I felt it was a story
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.120]   that really deserved to be in the spotlight,
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.120]   because it showed that the internet
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:26.120]   had not just technological potential, but human potential.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.280]   - Yeah.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.840]   - It had the ability to bring people together
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.680]   for their mutual betterment.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.960]   - Yeah, true.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.400]   I was reading a statistic that said
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.320]   that 70% of marriages now, people first met online.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.160]   - Yes.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.920]   - When you and I were in our 20s,
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.080]   of course, that was unheard of,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.920]   where you basically met through friends,
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.240]   or affiliation school, or maybe at a bar or something.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.080]   - Yes.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.960]   - But there is a lady at the dog park
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.480]   who I speak with when she brings her dog there.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.240]   Her husband passed away, but she has a new boyfriend now,
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.480]   and they met online, and she's 72.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.320]   - Yeah.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.360]   - Getting online has certainly changed lives,
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.840]   not always for the better, but changed things.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.560]   - Not for politics.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.840]   - Okay, so let's move on.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.880]   Well, you moved to the Wall Street Journal in 2008,
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.280]   and you continue to publish great articles
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.520]   on kind of exposing a lot of things
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.920]   that are going on on Wall Street.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.720]   That became your niche in many ways.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.200]   I don't wanna say the bad things,
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.000]   but things that to you didn't seem quite right.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.440]   And you continue to do that today.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.040]   You continue to bring those out.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.640]   So how did that all come about?
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.040]   I mean, why did you feel that was your calling?
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.960]   - Well, being an individual investor,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.720]   it's a hard, lonely job, right?
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.160]   It's somewhat different today,
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.640]   but certainly when I started,
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.200]   and even back in 2008, when you're thinking of,
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.520]   what was it like to make an investment?
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.400]   Either you had something shoved down your throat
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.800]   by a commissioned stockbroker or insurance agent
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.800]   who, in the best scenario, cared about you as a person,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.600]   but certainly was always partially motivated
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.640]   by a commission, and in the worst case,
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.760]   cared much more about the commission than about you.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.440]   That's if you had advice.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.440]   And if you didn't have advice,
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.680]   you had to do your research all by yourself.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.800]   Decades ago, you would have to go to a public library.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.680]   Then once the internet came along,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.600]   you drowned in information and misinformation
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.880]   and Wall Street propaganda.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.240]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.920]   - Being an individual investor is a constant challenge,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.080]   and one of the things I thought a lot about
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.320]   when working on my latest book,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.560]   the new edition of "Benjamin Graham's
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.360]   "The Intelligent Investor,"
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.840]   is it's probably harder than ever
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.680]   to be a disciplined, independent-minded investor
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:10.680]   because the propaganda and the pressure to trade
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.080]   those things are more inescapable than ever.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.920]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.160]   - Your stockbroker maybe used to be out to pick your pocket.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.280]   Now your stockbroker is in your pocket.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.640]   - Your phone, yeah.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.880]   - You can't escape.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.640]   You know, your phone is buzzing.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.040]   It's alerts.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.920]   It's trade this, buy that, sell this, trade options.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.080]   And I just feel that individual investors,
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.200]   they need somebody looking out for them
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   who doesn't have the kinds of flagrant conflicts
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.480]   that are so common in the financial industry.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.000]   And I would never say
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.440]   that I'm free of conflicts of interest.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.800]   I want every reader to subscribe to "The Wall Street Journal"
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.040]   and to read my column.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.280]   But I'm not getting commissions and fees and kickbacks
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.120]   and fancy trips from the people I write about.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.160]   You know, my only real agenda
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.160]   is to try to separate sense from nonsense.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.960]   - Yeah, I mean, you've always been that way
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.040]   in every way that I can remember.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.280]   I want to move on a little bit here
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.320]   because we got a lot of books to cover.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.320]   The second edition of "The Intelligent Investor,"
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.400]   Ben Graham's book, you published in 2003,
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.440]   but before we talk about that,
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.360]   I want to go through your other books first
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.240]   and then we'll get back to that one.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.080]   - Okay.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.880]   - The book that I thought was a fantastic read,
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.720]   it was just so unique that you wrote in 2007,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.040]   was "Your Money and Your Brain,"
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.080]   how the new science of neuroeconomics
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.720]   can help make you rich.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.600]   And here, you actually got under an FMRI machine
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.400]   and had your brain scanned
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.880]   while you were thinking about buying and selling stocks.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.600]   Talk about this.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   - Yeah, so I did that quite a few times, Rick.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.840]   What neuroscientists have done,
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.840]   or many of these folks call themselves neuroeconomists
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.560]   because the science is kind of a blend
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.560]   of economics, psychology, and neuroscience.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.560]   And some of these people have PhDs in economics,
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.080]   some have them in psychology,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.200]   some have them in neuroscience,
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.240]   and some have them in two or more of those fields.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.640]   It's an amazing group of researchers.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.560]   And what they do is they take
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.000]   the kinds of behavioral experiments
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.120]   that psychologists and economics,
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.480]   economists for that matter, have long done,
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.880]   and they conduct them using the tools of neuroscience.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.880]   So that might mean an EEG, like an electroencephalogram,
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.360]   where you have a helmet of electrodes
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.680]   on the outside of your head
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.320]   that's monitoring the electrochemical activity in your brain.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.840]   They will also do what's called an FMRI,
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.720]   or Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Test,
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.200]   which monitors the levels of oxygen
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.080]   in the blood within your brain.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.360]   And those are two of many methods that can be used
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.760]   to monitor which parts of the human brain
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.560]   are activated by which sorts of tasks.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.440]   And it enables these researchers
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.120]   to pinpoint the brain circuitry
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.800]   that's involved in various kinds of decision-making.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   So I participated as a subject in well over half a dozen,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.440]   may have been 10 different experiments,
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   in labs throughout the US and also one in the UK.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.480]   And I learned a lot about my own brain in doing all this,
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.800]   mainly about its limitations.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.320]   - That's always a danger of doing these kind of tests.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.760]   - Yes, although I can't say I was totally surprised
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.960]   to learn that my brain had severe limitations,
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   but it was fascinating because several of these experiments
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:36.480]   can demonstrate things that you might not otherwise
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.520]   be consciously aware of. - Interesting.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.000]   - You know, I spent a couple of years doing that research
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.640]   and I read hundreds of scientific articles
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.560]   and dozens of books
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.640]   and participated in all these experiments.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.640]   And really the idea was to take the data
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.760]   that economists and psychologists
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.760]   have been gathering for decades,
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.840]   really going back to the 1970s at least,
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:08.840]   about the suboptimal way that people make decisions
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.040]   about risk and reward over time.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.120]   And what neuroeconomics does
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:21.120]   is it takes it down to the biological level
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.440]   and says we can observe these behaviors
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.040]   in how people make decisions about their money,
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.320]   but let's now observe which circuits and structures
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.680]   in the brain are driving those decisions.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.600]   And that's particularly interesting
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.280]   because it enables us to connect these decisions
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.920]   with the fundamental emotions
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.520]   that those brain circuits generate in other contexts.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.200]   For example, we can learn that one of the reasons
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.400]   people are less effective at selling stocks
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.840]   than buying them is because these experiments have shown
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.680]   that if you sell at a loss,
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.920]   that transaction will be processed
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.720]   in the same part of the brain
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   that's involved when you smell vomit or step in dog manure.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.920]   It's the disgust circuitry in the brain.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.880]   - And a short-term gain, what does that do to your brain?
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.360]   - If it's part of a sequence
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.680]   so that it becomes like a predictable pattern,
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.240]   let's just say you bought a stock
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.520]   and you're watching it on your phone,
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.000]   maybe you have a Robin Hood account,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.800]   and it's green because it's going up.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.680]   And those slot machine wheels
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:48.120]   that represent the stock price on the app keep spinning
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.960]   and they keep spinning green and the price keeps going up.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.360]   Very quickly, the same circuits in your brain will fire
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:03.640]   in the brain of a cocaine addict
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.520]   who's about to get the next hit.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.640]   - Wow.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.840]   - It's literally physiologically addictive.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.680]   - Wow.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.040]   That's a great book, I love that book.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:12.880]   - Thank you.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.560]   - And then you came out with another book
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.800]   a couple of years later called "A Little Book of Safe Money."
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.100]   And this came right after the financial crisis, ironically.
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.960]   Little marketing there, perhaps?
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.280]   - Perhaps.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.680]   - I mean, little books, if you remember,
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.560]   were kind of a trend back then.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.360]   There was a little book on this, little book on that.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.080]   So you came out with your little book.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.440]   You talk about your cash, selecting stocks and bonds,
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.280]   choosing the right financial advisors.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.080]   You want to talk about that little book?
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.640]   - I will talk a little bit about that little book.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.920]   First of all, the best little book, of course,
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.320]   is Jack Vogel's little book, which is wonderful.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.840]   The publisher, John Wiley, approached me and asked,
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.680]   could I write something that was, I guess,
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.200]   attuned to the financial crisis?
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.040]   And I just wanted to write a very basic book
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.120]   that would be a guide for people
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.360]   who didn't have the patience to read anything long
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.960]   or particularly challenging.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.560]   I think it's very digestible.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   It was sort of a suggestion of what to do and what not to do,
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.240]   particularly during a financial crisis.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.080]   - Okay, very good.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.400]   And then we'll go to the next one,
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.100]   which is "The Devil's Financial Dictionary."
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.640]   It is a dictionary, but not really a dictionary name.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.000]   It's more of a satire of financial humor.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.840]   Funny to read and true, by the way,
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.760]   most of the definitions you have in there.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.600]   Talk about that.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   I mean, was it just something that was kind of irking you
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.680]   or were you collecting these things over the years?
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:53.200]   - Yes, so I'm a huge fan of someone I regard
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.720]   as a very unjustly neglected great American writer
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.540]   named Ambrose Bierce,
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.360]   who was roughly a contemporary of Mark Twain's,
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:06.720]   who died in, I think, 1914, 1917, around then.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.080]   And he was one of the most cynical people who ever lived.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.880]   He was much more cynical than I am.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.200]   I think I would say I overall have a very positive view
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.620]   of human nature.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.280]   You would not say that about Ambrose Bierce.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   He was called Bitter Bierce because he was so negative,
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.880]   but he was also incredibly funny.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.360]   And he wrote a book that was published in 1911
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.700]   called "The Devil's Dictionary,"
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.400]   which is just this collection
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   of brutally sarcastic short definitions of words.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.280]   And I'd always loved it.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.320]   I own at least two copies of the book.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.700]   I may have three.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.960]   I've read it probably dozens of times
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.880]   over the course of my life and it never gets old.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.840]   It's funnier every time you read it, actually.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.680]   And I just had always wanted to write something like that
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.880]   for investors.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.880]   And I started writing it as entries
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.120]   with no notion that it would ever become a book.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.000]   And what I did is I would write one definition
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.780]   and I would just post it to my website.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.780]   And people started tweeting them and emailing them around
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.560]   and asking me, "How many more of these do you have?"
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.860]   And then one day a book publisher said,
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.560]   "I could make a book out of that."
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.400]   And I said to my book agent,
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.320]   "I wanna turn this into a book."
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.520]   And he said, "Nah, that's not a good idea."
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.360]   And I just kept doing it.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.800]   And the next thing I knew, I had hundreds of them.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.200]   And at home in the evenings,
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.680]   my wife made me move out of the kitchen
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.480]   where I would sit with my laptop
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.400]   because I would be giggling to myself
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.480]   and distracting her from what she wanted to do.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.280]   And it finally dawned on me that if I find this stuff funny,
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.720]   maybe other people would.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.960]   And so it didn't begin as a book.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.640]   It just began as kind of a hobby.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.720]   - Yeah, that's what it seems like.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.360]   Could you give us just an example
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.640]   of one of your more favorite definitions?
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.280]   - Yeah, I should have prepped for this, Rick.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.040]   But bearing in mind that this is organized
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.160]   like a true dictionary where you have the word,
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.320]   the part of speech, and then the definition,
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.080]   I think the shortest two definitions in the book
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.780]   are day trader, noun, see, idiot.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.920]   And then the definition for idiot
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.760]   says noun, see, day trader.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.720]   - It's a funny book.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.960]   I've been reading your little definitions for years
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.200]   and enjoy reading about that,
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.680]   particularly in the financial advisor community,
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.320]   which is where I come from.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.080]   Which you have a few of those in there.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.240]   - Yes, I do.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.040]   - All right, we're gonna go now to
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.880]   The Intelligent Investor.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.680]   This is the third edition.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.920]   You did a second edition in 2003,
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.320]   and you also edited a book on Benjamin Graham
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.360]   back in 2009.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.280]   Benjamin Graham has been a huge influence on your life.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:26.280]   So what was the original thought back in 2003,
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.360]   or before then when you started working on the book?
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.120]   What was it about Benjamin Graham?
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.760]   Why did you take up this cause?
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.880]   - Well, I took up this cause
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.480]   because the publisher asked me.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:42.760]   Let me say that when the project editor called me
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:46.840]   and said, "We're thinking of publishing an update
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.120]   to Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.480]   Would you be interested in talking to us about that?"
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.320]   I said, "Yes!"
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.080]   (both laughing)
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   With, I think, several audible exclamation points.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.800]   It was the thrill of a lifetime
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.680]   to be asked to participate in this project.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.600]   I mean, Graham was one of the most brilliant investors
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.680]   of all time, and I think there's a strong case to be made
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.560]   that he was one of the most brilliant people
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.440]   of the 20th century, no matter how you define brilliance.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.480]   And it's just been a joy from start to finish
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.440]   to be involved in this project, an incredible honor.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.240]   The last person Graham asked to collaborate with him
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.760]   on The Intelligent Investor
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.800]   was the great financial writer, Adam Smith.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.880]   That was his pen name.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.400]   His real name was Jerry Goodman.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.520]   And Graham asked Adam Smith
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.160]   only because his first choice turned him down,
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.200]   and that was Warren Buffett.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.320]   To be in the company of those people
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.880]   is just an unbelievable honor.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.360]   My only objective in editing the book
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.240]   is to help Graham speak for himself
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.840]   48 years after he died,
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.840]   to keep the memory of his ideas alive
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.280]   and to keep that flame burning.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.360]   In a time when I think his message
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.720]   is much more important than it ever was.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.440]   - Speaking of Warren Buffett earlier,
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.720]   even though Buffett did not participate in the book,
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.800]   he called it the best book on investing ever written
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.320]   and still does.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:33.000]   - Yeah, and he still advises people to read the book.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.400]   People criticize Graham all the time
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.480]   for being old-fashioned,
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:45.480]   for having these formulaic techniques for valuing stocks,
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.640]   a price earnings ratio of this
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.720]   and a price to book value ratio of that.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   And you should multiply net working capital by X.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.760]   And then people say, "These things are all outmoded.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.840]   "Nobody invests like that anymore.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.280]   "Nobody should."
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.320]   And that completely misses the mark for two reasons.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.440]   First, during his lifetime,
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.120]   Graham revised the book several times.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.800]   And every time he revised it,
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.920]   he changed all those formulas.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   He updated them to reflect the new market realities
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.360]   at the time the new edition of the book was coming out.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.800]   And if he were still around today,
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.640]   of course he'd be 130 years old,
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.880]   but if he were still around today,
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.560]   he would update all those formulas all over again
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.040]   and they would look nothing like what's in the book.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.520]   So that's the first objection.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.400]   But the second objection is much more basic,
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.560]   which is that's not Graham's message.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.560]   Graham's message is that if you're an individual investor,
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:59.800]   you have to identify what is the game I am playing?
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.680]   What playing field am I on?
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.680]   Am I playing against Fidelity and Goldman Sachs
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:14.160]   and Citadel Hedge Fund and Renaissance Technologies
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.480]   and all these other big firms?
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.640]   Or am I playing some other game
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.080]   on some other playing field?
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.880]   And Graham's message is that if you try to play
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.880]   the same game as Wall Street itself,
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.200]   you will lose.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.320]   Why?
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.720]   Because most professional investors lose that game.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.800]   Why would you even wanna try playing that game
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.720]   when people with millions of dollars of resources
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:54.680]   and trillions of dollars of assets can't win that game?
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.760]   Roughly 80% of all professionally managed funds
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.520]   underperform the S&P 500.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.600]   Why would you try to chase other people?
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.280]   What Graham teaches is you win as an individual investor
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.280]   when you set clear objectives for your own needs
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.560]   and you then build a portfolio
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.320]   that's organized around one principle.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.920]   How can I put in place policies and procedures
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.880]   that will maximize my probability
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:34.400]   of reaching my unique financial goals?
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.680]   And if you think the only way you can do that
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.760]   is by beating the S&P 500, that makes no sense.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:47.200]   - I'm gonna go back to the first part of your answer,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.240]   which talked about when the original book was published
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.040]   in 1949, they had different formulas
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.840]   that were appropriate back then,
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.800]   maybe high dividend yield and some sort of ratios
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.720]   based upon dividends, which prior to the 1950s,
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.680]   stocks paid more dividends than...
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.520]   - Oh, yes.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.960]   - More yield than bonds paid.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.800]   - Yep.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.640]   - And so there was this idea that, well,
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.760]   you buy the stocks that have higher dividend yields
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.000]   than bonds, and when they go below it, you sell them,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.440]   and just different things like that.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.600]   But there's something that in the first edition, 1949,
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.640]   first edition of the book that Graham wrote,
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.000]   which he took out in later editions,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.920]   but I wanna read that to you
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.240]   because it really gets back to what you said
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.200]   about these changing formulas.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.640]   Here's what he wrote.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.480]   "Though business conditions may change,
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.560]   "corporations and securities may change,
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:37.040]   "and financial institutions and regulations may change,
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.920]   "human nature remains the same.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.880]   "Thus the important and difficult part of sound investing,
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.800]   "which hinges upon the investor's own temperament
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:50.520]   "and attitude, is not much affected by passing years."
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.800]   And I think it's really appropriate to what you were saying.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.000]   Things change within the markets,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.520]   and different companies change,
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.320]   and we have this rotation at the top,
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.920]   and different industries, and laws, and taxes,
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.280]   and all of that, but what really is important
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.640]   is your own temperament and how you approach it.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.560]   - Exactly, and Rick, Graham does a beautiful thing
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.960]   in the first edition in "The Intelligent Investor,"
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.960]   which he kind of scrunched and made shorter over the years,
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.040]   which is he sort of expounds on what he means
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.320]   by an intelligent investor.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.320]   I mean, it's an interesting term,
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.000]   and he says, and I'm paraphrasing him,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.080]   "I don't mean that you have high intelligence
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.160]   "as it's conventionally measured.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:40.520]   "It's not that you have an IQ of 180 or something like that,
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.840]   "or that you have a PhD in economics or finance,
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.160]   "or that you even have formal training
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.480]   "in economics or finance.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:55.040]   "It doesn't mean that you have a CFA or an MBA
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.920]   "or any other degree or designation
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.760]   "that confers professionally recognized expertise.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.920]   "What I mean," says Graham,
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.680]   "is that you have good judgment,
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.720]   "that you think independently, that you're skeptical,
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.200]   "that you're patient, you're analytical,
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.640]   "and that you cultivate the ability
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.440]   "to separate information from noise."
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.600]   And he makes all this very clear.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.120]   And I think over the years,
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:36.120]   the financial services industry has invested massively
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:41.160]   in complexity that is designed to bewilder
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.440]   the average investor and to make us feel
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.840]   that we're unqualified to manage our own money.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.400]   And the beauty of Jack Bogle
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.000]   and the original Vanguard experiment
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   was what Jack often called the power of simplicity.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Just let's make investing as simple as it possibly can be
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.800]   and see what happens.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.240]   And as the Bogle heads have shown,
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.800]   what happens is you empower people.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.160]   You let them know it's okay to have the confidence
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.920]   to invest your own money in strategies that make sense,
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.800]   that you can understand.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   And Graham was all about clearing the way for that.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.120]   I'm all about this one phrase.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.520]   I think I coined it.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:40.240]   Complexity is job security in the investment industry.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.480]   - Oh, yes.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.240]   I'm not sure I've ever written it down,
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.560]   but somewhere I'm sure I've said the real product
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.440]   of the financial services industry is complexity
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:56.840]   because complexity is where fees come from.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.680]   The simpler you make something,
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.400]   the less willing people are to pay high fees to buy it
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.960]   and the less justification there is
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.280]   for the fees in the first place.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.200]   - Let's move on to one topic that Graham talks about
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.920]   and you also opined on,
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.040]   and that is the difference
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.400]   between investing and speculating.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.960]   - Yeah, so this is something Graham
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.600]   was really passionate about,
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.000]   and it's a topic I care a lot about too.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.760]   His book, "Security Analysis,"
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.080]   which he published with David Dodd in 1934,
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.520]   Graham says, and I think I remember this verbatim.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.200]   We'll find out in a second.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.960]   He says, "An investment operation is one which,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.360]   upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principle
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.920]   and an adequate return."
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.000]   Yeah, I think I did do that right.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.160]   And then he adds,
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.160]   "Operations not meeting this definition are speculative."
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:59.800]   And so Graham has a very clear, simple definition,
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:04.800]   which is if you are buying a stock
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:11.680]   without understanding that it represents a company
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:16.800]   and without knowing anything about the underlying business,
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:21.840]   you're not investing, you're speculating.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.400]   Now, he hastens to add that speculation isn't all bad.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.960]   Everybody likes to go to Las Vegas or Monte Carlo
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.400]   or wherever your favorite gambling place might be.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.040]   Maybe it's a riverboat casino somewhere.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.800]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.800]   If you find it fun, if you limit your losses,
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:51.000]   and if you can afford to lose everything you stake
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.040]   and you don't care because you're there for the music,
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:58.600]   the show, the fun of the drive, back and forth,
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.680]   whatever, the flight, whatever it might be.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.760]   But if you go to a casino thinking
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.520]   that you're gonna make money doing it
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:10.280]   and you lose everything you put up
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.880]   because you don't have a system you just think you do,
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:18.280]   then you're speculating and it's really harmful.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.800]   And so that's the analogy he uses.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   And in my opinion, many people who call themselves investors
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   are really just speculators and we should call them that.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.680]   We should stop calling people investors
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.160]   when what they're doing is guessing.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.560]   - Some people would go further than that
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.880]   as to what's an investment.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.600]   You highlighted this, Seth Klarman,
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.200]   quote your commentary on chapter five.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.320]   And I feel like personally, I fall into this camp.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.120]   This is what Seth says the difference is
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.960]   between speculation and an investment.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.600]   The line I draw in the sand is that
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.000]   if an investment has cashflow
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.280]   or the likelihood of cashflow in the near term,
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.400]   and it is not purely dependent upon
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:10.280]   what a future buyer may pay, then that's an investment.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.840]   If an asset's value is totally dependent
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.080]   on the amount a future buyer might pay,
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.120]   then its purchase is speculation.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.640]   How do you feel about that definition?
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.080]   Obviously, you have some feelings about it
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.760]   because you put it in the book.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.280]   - Yeah, well, I think it's pretty darn good.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:33.280]   I think there might be the occasional exception.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:37.800]   I think if you buy a Rembrandt painting
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.120]   and you hold it for the rest of your life
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.160]   and then you either donate it to a museum
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.520]   or your heirs inherit it,
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:49.320]   I'm not sure that's a speculation.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.000]   It certainly doesn't have positive cashflow.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.800]   Your insurance bills alone would cost you
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.320]   tens of thousands of dollars a year.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   Another example might be if you know your town very well
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.680]   and there's a big piece of land
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.680]   at a key intersection of two roads
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   and you say someday there's gonna be a Walmart
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.040]   or a Costco or whatever it might be
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.720]   on that piece of property and you buy it,
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.200]   you might hold it for 20 years,
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.440]   but eventually some developer comes to you and says,
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.000]   "Rick, we'd really like to build an office park
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   "or a data center for AI or a nuclear power plant."
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.000]   I'm gonna push back a little bit on that
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.280]   because to me, I think a Christmas tree seller
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.080]   and the firework seller.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.320]   I might buy that piece of land on the corner,
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.360]   but while I'm waiting for Walmart to come along
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.240]   and buy it from me or a data center,
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.320]   I can rent it out to a Christmas tree seller.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.120]   I can rent it out to the guy selling fireworks
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.740]   on the 4th of July so I can get revenue from that land
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.240]   or I can just rent it out to a farmer
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.240]   and lease it and get revenue from it.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.040]   So that's my pushback on that.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.080]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.560]   I guess some people might leave it as undeveloped land,
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.540]   but there's always the potential to use it
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:19.920]   to generate cash flow.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.900]   So yeah, I mean, if there are exceptions
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:27.200]   to Seth Klarman's definition, I think they're rare.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.820]   - Yeah, I think so too.
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:31.160]   We've only scratched the surface on this book
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.520]   and our time is coming to an end.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:38.960]   I did want to talk about investment advisors a little bit,
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.520]   and you do write about investment advisors.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.960]   And the area I wanna go to is something
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.720]   that you wrote about that was a story
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.480]   that Alan Roth tells.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   I always found this to be a humorous story, a true story.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:59.220]   And it had to do with obtaining a certain recognition
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.000]   as a top financial planner.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.720]   So, I mean, you told the story in the book.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.000]   Alan has told it many times.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.080]   Could you just, let's just end with this
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.080]   because I think it's so hilarious.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.320]   - Alan was approached by some organization,
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.880]   I forget the exact name of it,
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:18.880]   but that gives out these so-called awards
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.560]   to top financial planners.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.440]   And I think the award is actually called
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.920]   one of America's top financial planners
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.640]   or something like that.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:33.080]   And Alan sort of scrunched up his face
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.080]   as I think you and I can both picture him doing
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.920]   and said, what is this thing?
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:41.120]   And why am I being honored by people I've never heard of?
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.440]   So he submitted an application for somebody else he knew
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.960]   to see whether that person could also be eligible.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:53.080]   And right away, he was told that all he would have to do
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.200]   is send in a check for whatever it was.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.840]   I think it was like $150.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.480]   And this friend of his, Max,
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.520]   could easily also become one of America's
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.120]   top financial planners.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:09.000]   So Alan did and the plaque came in the mail
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.520]   and Alan gave it to Max,
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.760]   who was very proud of becoming
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.560]   one of America's top financial planners.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.680]   Alan said, would you like to put it on your desk
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.080]   in your office?
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:26.080]   And Max didn't really answer because Max was Alan's dog.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:30.040]   - Max Tailwagger.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:30.960]   - That's right.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.840]   And so Alan's little dachshund puppy
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.560]   became one of America's top financial planners
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.560]   because Alan just basically bought honor for his dog.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.920]   Some people call these things trust badges.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.920]   Investors should always be wary in a crowded,
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.680]   actually overcrowded financial marketplace
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:59.040]   where it is very difficult for investment advisors
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:02.720]   and financial planners to distinguish themselves.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:06.720]   And where so many people just charge the same price
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:10.000]   of 1% of assets per year,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.600]   how is a consumer supposed to distinguish
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.600]   good advice from bad?
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:18.000]   Well, these third-party organizations say,
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   oh, well, Max is one of America's top financial planners.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.360]   So he must be good.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.400]   And Alan's point is, well, he is a good dog.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.200]   I say good dog to him all the time,
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.080]   but he's not a good financial planner.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.320]   And it's just a very useful reminder
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.120]   that to get high quality, reliable financial advice,
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.480]   you have to do a little bit of homework.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.960]   And there's really no way around that.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.080]   You need to dig into a person's background and credentials
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:57.680]   and what they do with money when they manage it
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.360]   and how they charge fees on it
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.160]   to make sure you're comfortable with that
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.400]   rather than just going with your gut and saying,
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.320]   oh, he's a top financial planner.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.360]   He has a plaque on his wall.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.240]   - Or he's a vice president.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.480]   - Yes, a vice president, yeah.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:15.440]   - When I first got into the financial services industry
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:18.960]   back in the 1980s and I got a job at a brokerage firm
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   and they made me a junior vice president.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.040]   And I mean, I didn't know anything,
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.880]   but you know, vice president.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:31.400]   We could go on for hours here talking about the book.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.720]   - We could go on for a week.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:37.320]   - But I want to thank you so much for being on the podcast.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.360]   Love to have you on again sometime.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.200]   - Yes, I think now that I've been on,
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.760]   I think that some of the institutional barriers
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.680]   may have fallen away.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.800]   - Well, that's great to hear.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.920]   - I hope so.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:49.920]   - Good luck with the book.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.320]   Thank you again for participating on this podcast.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.200]   - Well, it was an absolute pleasure, Rick, a total joy.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.960]   And thanks for the great questions.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.960]   And I really appreciate the opportunity.
