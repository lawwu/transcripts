[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420]   There's a funny story I read that when you won the Fields Medal, somebody from the internet wrote
[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.560]   you and asked, you know, what are you going to do now that you've won this prestigious award?
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.160]   And then you just quickly, very humbly said that, you know, this
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.620]   shiny medal is not going to solve any of the problems I'm currently working on.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.980]   So I'm just going to keep working on them. First of all, it's funny to me that you would answer
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.520]   an email in that context. It just shows your humility. But anyway, it's another way for me
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.060]   to ask about Gregorio Perlman. What do you think about him famously declining the Fields Medal
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.960]   and the Millennial Prize, which came with a $1 million of prize money? He stated that I'm not
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.080]   interested in money or fame. The prize is completely irrelevant for me. If the proof is correct, then
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.240]   no other recognition is needed. He's somewhat of an outlier, even among mathematicians who tend to have
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.300]   somewhat idealistic views. I've never met him. I'd be interested to meet him one day, but I'd never
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.220]   had the chance. He's always had strong views about certain things. It's not like he was completely
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.480]   isolated from the math community. I mean, he would give talks and write papers and so forth. But at
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.140]   some point, he just decided not to engage with the rest of the community. He was disillusioned.
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.100]   And he decided to peace out and, you know, collect mushrooms in St. Petersburg or something. And that's
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.280]   fine. You can do that. He hasn't published since in this field, but that's fine. There's many,
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.300]   many other people who've done so as well. I guess one thing I didn't realize initially with the Fields Medal
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.280]   is that it sort of makes you part of the establishment. Most mathematicians,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.940]   you know, there's career mathematicians, you know, you just focus on publishing your next paper,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.820]   maybe getting one test to promote one rank and starting a few projects, maybe taking some
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.900]   students or something. Yeah. But then suddenly people want your opinion on things and you have
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.320]   to think a little bit about, you know, things that you might just so foolishly say because you know,
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.160]   no one's going to listen to you. So it's more important now.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.380]   This is where I would probably say that I like the Fields Medal. It does inspire a lot of young
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.100]   people somehow. This is just how human brains work.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.580]   Yeah.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.300]   At the same time, I also want to give sort of respect to somebody like Gregorio Perlman, who
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.180]   is critical of awards in his mind. Those are his principles and any human that's able for their
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.660]   principles to like do the thing that most humans would not be able to do. It's beautiful to see.
