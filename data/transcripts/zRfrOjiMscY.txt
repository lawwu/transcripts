[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   I am reading Psalm 103, a Psalm of David.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.160]   Bless Yahweh, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.960]   Bless Yahweh, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits, who pardons all your iniquities,
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.880]   who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with loving
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.640]   kindness and compassion, who satisfies your years with good things, so that your youth
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.560]   is renewed like the eagle.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.920]   Yahweh performs righteous deeds and judgments for all who are oppressed.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.520]   He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the sons of Israel.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.000]   Yahweh is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in loving kindness.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.560]   He will not always contend with us, and he will not keep his anger forever.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.760]   He has not dealt with us according to our sins, and he has not rewarded us according
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.680]   to our iniquities.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.960]   For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.680]   who fear him.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.160]   As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.200]   As a father has compassion on his children, so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.300]   him.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.880]   For he himself knows our form; he remembers that we are but dust.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.760]   As for man, his days are like grass.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.920]   As a flower of the field, so he flowers.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.920]   When the wind has passed over it, it is no more, and its place acknowledges it no longer.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.880]   Yet the loving kindness of Yahweh is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.040]   him, in his righteousness to children's children, to those who keep his covenant and remember
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.180]   his precepts to do them.
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.840]   Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.320]   Bless Yahweh, you his angels, mighty in strength, who perform his word, obeying the voice of
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.640]   his word.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.760]   Bless Yahweh, all you his hosts, you who serve him, doing his will.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.840]   Bless Yahweh, all you works of his, and all places of his rule.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.160]   Bless Yahweh, O my soul.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.880]   This is God's holy word.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.880]   Amen.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   Amen.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   Amen.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
