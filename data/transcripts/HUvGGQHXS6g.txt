[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180]   All right, let's do a final segment here.
[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.660]   I wanna talk about the books I read in April.
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.860]   All right, Jesse, here's the bad news.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.040]   I lost my list.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.380]   I don't know what happened to it.
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.140]   - You were talking about this before the show
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.100]   and I think you should explain
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.020]   how you finished the book so early.
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.780]   - Yeah, so you might be thinking, well, wait a second,
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.220]   can't you just remember all the books you read in April?
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.220]   That was just last month.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.580]   But here's the thing, I count books by the month
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.460]   I finished them and I'm on a weird rotation.
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.580]   I'm sort of out of sync.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.860]   So I tend to finish the books for a month.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.860]   I start them before the month begins
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.980]   and tend to finish them about halfway through the month.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.780]   So I'm already, for example, a book and a half
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.460]   into my June books, even though it's May, whatever.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.540]   So when I'm trying to remember my April books,
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.760]   a lot of these are books I started reading
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.380]   or maybe started reading, what, back in March.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.060]   So this is just the weirdness
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.820]   of how I've sort of shifted off schedule.
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.380]   So I just walked around my library today
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.500]   and looked at books and, okay,
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.220]   that one I remember, that one I remember.
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.900]   So I was able, Jesse, to reconstruct
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.860]   four out of the five books I read in April.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.660]   I can't remember the fifth.
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.060]   - You had a remarkable notebook.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.260]   - Right now, I would just be hitting the buttons, right?
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.220]   The sun would come in through the window.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.700]   I'd be fashionably dressed with a macchiato
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.200]   and I would see the books.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.720]   And then they're always, always in these videos,
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.220]   they always have like a business chart that they're labeling.
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.780]   In fact, here, switch over to the screen for a second.
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.700]   Here's the Kindle Scribe ad.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.220]   Look at what's in the picture.
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.060]   Am I right?
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.480]   It's a chart that they're labeling.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.720]   That's what always happens in these ads.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.020]   They're always like, what?
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.420]   And they put like an exclamation point
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.840]   and they're drawing on a chart.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.020]   That's what business people do, is they label charts.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.420]   But anyway, yes, my remarkable Scribe
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.240]   would be able to find this.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.100]   All right, but I did remember four of them.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.480]   See, it helped because I went on a vacation
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.500]   during that period.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.860]   So it was easy for me to remember
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.320]   what books I brought on the vacation.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.520]   So that helped me here.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.940]   All right, so I read the book,
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.220]   "The Real Work" by Adam Gopnik.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.220]   Gopnik is a long time staff writer for "The New Yorker."
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.600]   He's known for art criticism.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.060]   So this was his first,
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.460]   the book takes a tentative step
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.540]   towards the pragmatic nonfiction world.
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.280]   So this book is about what really goes into mastery.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.540]   Gopnik's a great writer.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.700]   You'll see that as you read the book.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.940]   And basically he builds reflections about mastery
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.540]   around different, I guess you could think of him as masters
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.220]   he spends time with or different activities he pursues.
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.540]   I was reading this actually in Las Vegas
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.900]   and I went to see David Copperfield.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.180]   And so I appreciated that there's a whole section
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.520]   in this book where he's working with professional magicians.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.740]   And this is where "The Real Work," that term comes from,
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.060]   is the world of professional magicians.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.740]   So anyways, he's a great writer.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.060]   This is not a Gladwell book.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.980]   So it's not gonna, let's break down mastery
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.340]   into the contrarian understanding
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.580]   that you can then apply to your life.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.080]   It's more reflective and philosophical than that,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.660]   but it's very well-written, I enjoyed it.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.680]   Also read John McPhee's "Levels of the Game."
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.020]   It's his book about tennis, Arthur Ashe versus Grabener.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.680]   Brilliant example, it's sort of studied
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.040]   in nonfiction courses, just a brilliant example
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.640]   of what McPhee is known for,
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.920]   which is using sophisticated structure
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.560]   to try to generate insight.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.480]   And so the structure of "Levels of the Game,"
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.720]   this book is from the '60s.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.200]   This has been replicated a lot now,
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.240]   but I think McPhee was at the cornerstone of this,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.120]   is it's built around a single US Open tennis match
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.880]   between Arthur Ashe and David Grabener.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.000]   And it moves seamlessly without even section breaks
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.560]   between they'll be playing this point
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.080]   and then it's a backstory, and then back to the point.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.360]   And so it goes back and forth
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.960]   between these two tennis players' backstories
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.480]   and the game that's going on
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.200]   in a sort of complicated structure
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.120]   where he won't even break, it'll be a return.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.920]   And then next paragraph is Arthur Ashe,
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.400]   15 years earlier.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.040]   And he goes back and forth, back and forth.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.200]   And the idea is as you learn more and more
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.160]   about the backstory of these players,
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.940]   the nuances of their play,
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.800]   which you're also learning more and more about
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.840]   as you hear about the match, become more clear
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.120]   that he's drawing this connection
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.440]   between their style of play
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.680]   and all these different things that went into their history
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.800]   and who they are as a person
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.480]   and what's going on in the culture around them.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.560]   It's just a masterwork in narrative nonfiction.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.080]   And one of the things that caught my attention,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.580]   'cause I read that and I read Gottlieb's book
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.040]   at the same time, two New Yorker writers,
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.200]   obviously different generations, is that McPhee,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.000]   I don't know who's doing this right now,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.560]   but I'm inspired by this.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.240]   McPhee uses simple language, complicated structure
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.020]   to get the truth.
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.880]   And I would say that's probably,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.000]   not a lot of people are doing that now.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.380]   I would say the tone of the New Yorker right now,
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.960]   including my writing for better, for worse,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.160]   also relies on lyricism to try to get at truth
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   more evocative sentences that have some sort of poetry
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.760]   in the writing, that the writing and the rhythms,
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.320]   there's a lot of rhythm of writing work,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.140]   I think is going on a lot now at the New Yorker,
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.740]   that it's almost lyrical nonfiction prose
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.880]   that can extract insights and understanding.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.880]   And Gopnik's great at that,
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.080]   he's a very philosophical, self-reflective writer.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.560]   McPhee was so different.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.760]   I mean, his sentences are simple.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   (imitates music)
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   They read like they come out of one of those
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.680]   mid-century grammar guides, strunken whatever.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.280]   - Or they might read like you speak,
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.680]   like people speak probably, right?
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.400]   - Well, what I meant by the grammar guides,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   and I'm forgetting the classic strunken--
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.720]   - Strunken white.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.540]   - Is it strunken white?
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.640]   Yeah, so in the sense of sometimes it's very formal grammar,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.080]   it's like, oh, this is just perfectly constructed grammar,
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.240]   is what I mean by it.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.600]   Yeah, it's like this comma, this semicolon, this,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.480]   but it's using grammar like you would see
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.040]   in strunken white, like, oh,
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.540]   this is a well-constructed sentence,
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.080]   not like in maybe in like something I might write
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.440]   or a modern New Yorker piece,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.880]   you use grammar to help support something
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.400]   that's more poetic or lyrical or whatever.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.960]   The sentences are just boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.520]   subordinate clause, boom, just very straightforward.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.340]   And yet when combined with complicated structure
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.880]   is incredibly deep.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.480]   So I don't know, not a lot of people are doing that now.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.640]   Maybe a lot of, not a lot of people
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.680]   are doing that back then either,
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.040]   but I just as a writing masterclass exercise,
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.160]   reading 60s era McPhee, it just got me thinking a lot
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.040]   about how I write, about how he wrote, about his effect,
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.840]   made me think about my own writing a little bit.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.600]   So it was cool.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.500]   That's how you form my book group.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.440]   I'm in a book group that just reads sports books.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.280]   - Yeah.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.000]   - Yeah, so that was my turn to pick.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.280]   And so of course I was gonna pick like.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.040]   - Was there a lot of tennis strategy in there?
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.240]   - Yeah, you should read it.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.480]   I'll loan you my copy.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.320]   - I should.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.560]   - Yeah, because you play a lot of tennis these days.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.880]   - I play at least three times a week.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.760]   - Yeah.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.440]   - It's a complicated game, it's like golf.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.280]   - Oh my God.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.940]   The sense I got, yeah, it's like golf.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.800]   That's the sense I got is you gotta be playing
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   since you were five.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.240]   - Not necessarily, but you need to play a lot.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.640]   - You have to play a lot of maintenance.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.280]   Like if you wanna be any good,
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.640]   you gotta put a lot of time in it.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.320]   - So one of the things maybe you would understand this
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.720]   is because you're playing tennis now,
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.800]   I didn't understand it as much.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.840]   So one of the big parts of Ash's game
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.520]   is that when he was being trained coming up as a kid,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.200]   they wanted him,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   they almost exclusively was training his backhand.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.160]   They wanted the backhand to feel
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.520]   as comfortable to him as a forehand, right?
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.480]   So it was just like, I'm very, very comfortable with it.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.200]   - Yeah, 'cause a lot of times people just expose
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.360]   your backhand if it's weak.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.400]   - Yeah, so he's just very comfortable with his backhand.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.160]   And then he was a very innovative, creative player, right?
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.680]   So he was very much risky, exciting shots,
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.200]   cross court drop shots, the winners, that type of thing.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.920]   Whereas Grabener was much more of a mechanical,
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.760]   play the odds.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.800]   There's a lot of statistics in it.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.840]   It was very interesting.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.680]   - Actually in air,
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.360]   there was a cool little commercial with Ash.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.320]   Remember that in the beginning of the movie?
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.280]   - Yep, with the racket.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.120]   Yep, the wooden racket.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.240]   Yep, they get into that because Grabener used to,
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.320]   moved on to metal racket.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.680]   So I think you would like it.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.800]   The thing, the tennis players in my book group were saying,
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.320]   they were surprised by how fast Ash was serving.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.120]   It really is not that far from today's era of monster serves
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.440]   and it was within, I mean, he was serving like 130
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.640]   or something like that.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.480]   - Wow.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.920]   - Or 125, or like he was close with a wooden racket.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.200]   So, you know, it's like now it's supposed to be the age
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.280]   of the monster serve, but you read this match,
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.760]   like they would wanna get,
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.800]   if you could get four aces in a row,
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.480]   you're like, that's kind of what I'm looking for,
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.960]   is like in a lot of these sets,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.560]   it's gonna be all aces for the serve side.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   It's all about making use of the few mistakes that happen.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.320]   - Mm-hmm, it's interesting.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   - All right, other book I read,
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.520]   "The Transcendent Brain" by Alan Lightman.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.680]   I like Alan Lightman a lot, former physicist at MIT
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.320]   that went on to start their science writing
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.400]   master degree program.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.240]   I like him in part, as I've mentioned on the show,
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.440]   because their family has a cabin on this Island up in Maine
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.800]   and they go up there and spend the entire summer.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.920]   I think it has electricity, maybe.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.560]   There's no phone, there's no internet.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.520]   And I always just, you know, I sort of knew,
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.360]   I didn't know him well.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.800]   My wife had crossed paths with him a few times
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.760]   when we lived in Boston and he was at MIT, I was at MIT.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.440]   And, you know, we had friends in common.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.400]   I always loved that about him.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.680]   But anyways, he now just writes these
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.760]   short provocative books for Pantheon,
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.280]   which is cool, which I appreciate.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.280]   And this one was trying to give a materialist explanation
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.720]   for spirituality, trying to say you can appreciate
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.520]   and even organize your life around spiritual experiences
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.760]   while still maintaining a scientific materialist view.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.640]   So he sort of gives a Darwinian explanation
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.680]   for why maybe we feel these senses of connection
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.360]   or moments of transcendent awe
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.960]   and trying to explain that materialistically.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.400]   Typical Alan Lightman book, it's short
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.080]   and it dives into these interesting angles,
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.880]   different history of religion and brain science over here
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.720]   and doesn't write more than he needs to write.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.400]   So I always enjoy a good Alan Lightman book.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.120]   The final book I remember reading in April
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   is called "Finding the Mother Tree" by Suzanne Simard,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.800]   who is a, I don't know what the field is, forestry maybe?
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.680]   Who studied, she did a lot of the innovative work
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.400]   that discovered trees are connected to each other
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.080]   underground through networks of fungus.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.680]   They can not only communicate with each other
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.920]   with these underlying fungus networks,
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.960]   they can actually move resources on it.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.360]   Sugars, for example, from one tree to another.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.160]   And you even have in forest,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.640]   you'll find what she called the mother tree,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.760]   this very old tree that was connected
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.800]   to a lot of younger trees
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.480]   and it helps to redistribute resources to them, et cetera.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.040]   Anyway, she did a lot of work on that.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.000]   And so this book is about that.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.600]   There's been a couple of books in the last 10 years
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.480]   about trees and communicating.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.680]   This one is interesting because it's memoir.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.240]   It's memoir/science.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.760]   So she's actually a very good memoir writer.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.680]   She had a very interesting upbringing in Canada.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.680]   She comes from one generation removed
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.960]   from a Canadian lumbering family
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.640]   and worked actually in the timber industry
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.760]   before she moved over to academia.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.840]   It's actually a pretty astutely drawn self-portrait
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.920]   that's intertwined with her scientific discovery.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.600]   So you learn about her discoveries as they occur in her life
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.200]   as she tells a story of her life.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.720]   And I thought it was a surprisingly well-written book.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.520]   And the science is interesting too.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.360]   Now, there's a bit of a grain of salt
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.480]   that has to be taken with it.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.600]   I mean, there's a, I don't know,
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.480]   a sort of like philosophical or political resonance
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.480]   to this idea that clearly has to be involved
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.560]   in the popularity and the push of these ideas.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.240]   It's like, no, trees don't compete.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.080]   They share resources together.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.320]   They help each other and cooperate.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.280]   They mother each other.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.840]   I mean, there's very much like embedded
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.000]   in these scientific studies,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.720]   also reflections of critiques of aspects
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.680]   of capitalist culture.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.280]   And so it's a complicated field,
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.720]   but she found some really cool things,
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.840]   but the book was really well-written
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.720]   and she has a really, had a really interesting life.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.280]   So I grabbed it randomly.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.280]   This was a politics and prose table, boom.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.120]   Let me just grab it.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.360]   It's not a new book.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.400]   Sometimes when you're traveling,
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.240]   you have to just serendipitously grab something.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.120]   And I'm glad I grabbed that one.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.080]   All right, so that's four books.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.280]   There was a fifth.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.680]   I just can't remember what it is.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.840]   I should just make one up, Jesse.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.160]   What would be the most impressive thing I could have read?
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.840]   - All right, you guys.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   - I was reading "Gravity's Rainbow" or "War and Peace."
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.680]   Let's just make up what it is.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.840]   But there was a fifth in there,
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.680]   but those are the four I can remember.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.140]   (upbeat music)
