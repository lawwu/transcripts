[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.880]   We're honored to be joined by speaker and author Paul Tripp
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.840]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast this week.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.760]   Paul, you are like-minded to our ministry.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.720]   You seem to get Christian hedonism
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.900]   about as well as anyone.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.040]   You understand that life is competing glories.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.200]   You understand the expulsive power of a new affection.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.320]   You get these dynamics.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.580]   And it seems like your contribution to the church
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.520]   is really helping others to apply these realities
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.760]   to everyday life.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.360]   Would you agree with that?
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.640]   Yeah, I think that's true.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.000]   And I think much of what I do
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.880]   in terms of the gospel and everyday life
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.160]   is driven by those glory themes
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.400]   that I think John really influenced for me
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.720]   earlier in my ministry.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.640]   And man, I think life this side of eternity
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.560]   is just one big glory war.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.840]   Yeah, and so you do this with a very concrete application.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.840]   Yeah, and I think that's the piece of the puzzle
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.360]   that God has entrusted to me.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.800]   I think of myself as a theologian,
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.680]   but I do it in the street.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.480]   And you do it with style.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.960]   (Paul laughs)
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.960]   Okay, let's get to work.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.560]   We are grateful to have you on.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.240]   Here's question number one for you.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.980]   The world is full of beauty and pleasure,
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.240]   all by God's design, all by God's intent.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.240]   It's wonderful.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.080]   In one of your more recent books called "Sex and Money,"
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.880]   you make this very perceptive point.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.080]   You say this, quote,
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.760]   "Boundless pleasure is a deception," end quote.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.600]   Explain that.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.440]   What do you mean when you say
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.840]   that boundless pleasure is a deception?
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.680]   Well, pleasure can never be an end in itself.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.160]   I can never just say,
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.280]   "I'm gonna go wherever pleasure leads me,"
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.420]   because pleasure requires boundaries.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.420]   And that is because my heart is always living
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.560]   under the rulership of something,
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.320]   and what controls my heart will control my body.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.480]   And so I must not let pleasure,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.120]   the pursuit of pleasure, be the thing that rules me.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.320]   Now, here's where I think the church has gotten this wrong.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.820]   We have thought the way to solve that
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.680]   is by being pleasure negative.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.840]   And pleasure itself is actually God-glorified.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.000]   God created an incredibly pleasurable world.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.240]   It's just, it greets us every day.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.960]   All the sights and sounds and colors and tastes
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.840]   and textures are just magnificent.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.220]   They're pleasurable.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.400]   And God created our bodies
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.380]   so that we have all kinds of pleasure gates,
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.920]   our eyes, our nose, our mouth, our ears, our hands.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.200]   I mean, those things are not wrong.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.000]   They sing to the glory of God.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.880]   Here's the ticket with pleasure.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.880]   My pursuit of pleasure, my enjoyment of pleasure,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.180]   must submit itself to a greater pleasure
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.840]   than physical pleasure.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.480]   And that's the pleasure of God.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.320]   I think I say in this chapter
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.440]   that pleasure is only protected by pleasure.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.840]   It's the greater pleasure of God
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.160]   that my joy in my relationship with God,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.900]   my joy in pleasing God, my celebration of God's grace,
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.520]   my desire to live the way this beautiful creator made me
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.360]   that protects me from a slavery to pleasure
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.460]   that gets me in trouble.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.720]   So pleasure, pleasure requires boundaries.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.160]   And I think that where our culture is, is this.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.600]   If it's got boundaries, it's not pleasurable.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.960]   And that's dangerous.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.680]   Don't give me any boundaries.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.380]   Because when you give me boundaries, you crush pleasure.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.080]   I think the opposite is true.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.120]   Boundaryless pleasure crushes pleasure
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.800]   because it becomes a slaving, addicting,
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.640]   dark and destructive and hurtful.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.800]   - Yeah, so sin is the lie that unbounded pleasures
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.360]   are the path to true joy.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.960]   - Sure, and where do you see that first?
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.160]   You see that in the garden.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.800]   I mean, you have just incredibly pleasurable place
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.720]   made beautiful by God,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.720]   placing Adam and Eve in the middle of it
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.800]   so they can enjoy its beauty.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.000]   But there were some boundaries.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.520]   And that first act of rebellion
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.420]   is a rebellion against the boundaries that God set.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.480]   They weren't driven, Adam and Eve weren't driven
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.580]   because there was pleasure outside of the boundaries
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.840]   and they long to experience those pleasures.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.720]   There were glories inside the boundaries.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.680]   They didn't want boundaries.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.940]   And we've been pushing against boundaries ever since.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.400]   That's the biblical word for sin called trespass.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.800]   What is a trespass?
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.660]   A trespass is stepping over a boundary.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.800]   When I park in the no parking zone and I see the sign,
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.520]   that's a trespass because it's a willing rebellion
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.300]   against a boundary that has been set for me.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.000]   - Thank you, Paul.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.160]   That's Paul Tripp, the author of the book, "Sex and Money."
