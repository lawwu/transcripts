[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.660]   - Welcome back to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.800]   I'm here with my guy, AG,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.800]   AKA one time champion, AKA Tarzan.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.960]   (laughing)
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.720]   Man, so I wanna start off like in the hoop space,
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.720]   and then we'll kind of transition to off the court stuff.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.240]   But you came to Denver, I wanna say two, three years ago,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.100]   probably three years ago now.
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.240]   You came from Orlando.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.160]   - It's gone quick.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.800]   - Yeah, it really has.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.240]   What was the difference to you from, you know,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.480]   hooping in Orlando?
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.560]   We've talked about it a little bit,
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.000]   but like now playing in Denver,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.360]   playing for a winning team,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.320]   competing for a championship and all that.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.440]   - Man, it felt like,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.800]   well the spacing on the floor was way different.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.800]   Like being able to play between you, Jamal, and Joker.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.600]   - Yeah.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.400]   - Like people have forgot about me.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.880]   Which is cool, yeah.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.560]   So like I'm just getting in where I fit in.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.120]   I'm getting easy layups.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.600]   Everything that I got in Orlando,
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.280]   it was like, yo, that was tough.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.120]   - That's a tough bucket.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.940]   - Tough bucket.
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.840]   Like everyone was like, damn, that's a tough bucket, A.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.880]   That's a tough bucket.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.400]   And that was tough, that was tough.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.240]   - Yeah.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.480]   - When I came to Denver, it was like,
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.840]   okay, that's an easy two, little back cut.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.240]   I felt like playing in between y'all three,
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.440]   we can't lose, bro.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.280]   - Yeah.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.120]   - Like.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.600]   - You over there, you were like, you were the man.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.640]   You know, the go-to scorer.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.920]   That's why everything was so tough.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.520]   You know, teams, you know, game planning for you
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.980]   and you're like the man.
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.400]   And over here, you're obviously a big part
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.560]   of what we got going on,
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.020]   but you got so many good players on our team.
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.620]   So, you know, when they're worried about you,
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.580]   I'm getting an open three.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.520]   When they're worried about me or KCP in the corners,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.620]   you're getting a dunk.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.640]   Was it hard to transition from being the man over there
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.600]   to kind of like filling a role over here or no?
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.620]   - Nah, not at first, not at first.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.280]   Just 'cause, I mean, I get to play my role.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.120]   - Yeah.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.440]   - You know, I get to play the dunker.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.760]   I get run outs, cuts, lobs.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.460]   I can just, you know, shoot like spot ups.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.680]   You know, like I can like fill in the gaps.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.520]   - Yeah.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.360]   - You know what I mean?
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.180]   Which is perfect for me.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.020]   That's how I like to play.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.200]   We move the ball here.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.800]   The open man is the right man.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.160]   And then, like y'all are so talented.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.400]   Y'all are so skilled.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.000]   Like, I'm not even worried like what shots you guys take.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.680]   - Don't say y'all, you got it too.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.040]   - But it's true though, bro.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.000]   Y'all are like, it's different.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.400]   It was just like a different level of talent.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.240]   - Yeah.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.520]   - Coming from Orlando to Denver.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.720]   It just was, the culture was already there.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.040]   The skills that you guys had, the talent.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.400]   It was just different, bro.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.680]   - Yeah, talk a little bit about like the mentality
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.600]   and the difference between being on a winning team
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.440]   versus not.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.680]   'Cause you know, we all grew up,
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.400]   everyone in the league grew up being a man
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.960]   and they probably won tons and tons of games.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.320]   But you get to the NBA and depending on where
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   you get drafted, you might be on one of those teams
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.260]   that really doesn't win like a whole lot of games.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.600]   And I feel like a lot of players kind of develop
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.940]   the mentality of like, man, this is just what it is.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.780]   I'm chilling.
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.320]   Like my team's not probably gonna make the playoffs.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.120]   We definitely not winning the championship.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.840]   I'ma just show up to work and kind of leave.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.920]   And we've talked about that before,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.280]   how, man, y'all weren't even really tripping.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.860]   Y'all would just show up to work and then hop in your whips
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.520]   in the 80 degree weather in Orlando.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.560]   - That's real, bro.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.400]   - That's crazy.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.320]   - That's real.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   Charles Barkley, he was talking to my dad.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.120]   And he was like, you know, if you're gonna lose,
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.160]   Orlando's not a bad place to lose it.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.200]   - Facts.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.240]   - It's 80 degree weather.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.520]   So people were coming in, kind of just like
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.200]   showing up, doing their job,
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.320]   hopping back in there like drop top or whatever.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.880]   Going back home and enjoying the city.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.040]   Orlando's a great city when it comes down to it.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.600]   - You got the crib out there.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.520]   - Yeah, it's underrated city.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.560]   But just like the culture, it just,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.920]   it wasn't a winning culture.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.640]   Like, I think they're getting it together now.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.400]   You know, they're starting to get it together.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.800]   They're a good team now.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.600]   But when I was in Orlando,
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.820]   shoot, it was six different coaches.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.120]   - How many years, every year?
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.480]   - Yeah, I had five different coaches in six years.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.320]   And four different GMs.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.760]   And so there was no stability.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.400]   It was like you were a rookie every year.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.600]   You were having to try and prove yourself.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.360]   - Different plays, different strategies, that's tough.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.920]   - It was tough, bro, it was tough.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.880]   And try and lead the organization in the right direction.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.880]   And it was difficult, bro.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.120]   - Yeah, that's crazy to think about.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.480]   Yeah, so now you in Denver.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.220]   And we just came off of a chip.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.440]   What was your favorite moments in the playoffs?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.380]   Did you always kind of feel like,
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.700]   man, we are for sure winning a championship?
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.140]   Or kind of what was your mentality in the playoffs?
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.100]   For me, it felt like,
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.220]   except for that Suns series when they tied it up 2-2,
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.820]   I was kind of like, man, nobody's touching us right now.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.580]   Like, that's how it felt for the most part.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.020]   Minnesota's a good team and they're balling this year.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.260]   But that series, you know, they got one game.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.300]   I kind of felt like we always were in control a little bit.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.440]   But what was your favorite moments
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.660]   from the playoffs in that championship run?
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.340]   - Man, my favorite moments.
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.060]   I always have to say, that was a great run, man.
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.340]   We were real dominant.
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.180]   - Yeah.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.500]   - We lost four games.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.040]   - One in Minnesota, two Suns, one Miami, yeah.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.140]   And really, like, could have won all those games.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.700]   - We really, yeah, right.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.060]   - Book and KD, like, dominant.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.660]   They were dominant in those two games that they won.
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.020]   Minnesota, that game that they won, it went into overtime.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.740]   That was one of my favorite moments of the playoffs.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.620]   That Minnesota, the game that we lost in.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.020]   We were down like 12 or something like that.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.580]   - We were like a minute and a half, two minutes, yeah.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.420]   - Tied it up.
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.260]   That was crazy.
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.500]   I was like, oh, okay, we're serious.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.700]   Like, we got no quitting us.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.300]   Like, we could really do this.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.820]   That was a, and then like, you know,
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.060]   obviously just winning it, bro.
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.100]   Like, the champagne showers, it's so sick.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.100]   - We was in the locker room.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.940]   Yeah, people don't know.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.340]   We were in the locker room for hours on hours.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.620]   Like, after we won the tip, you know,
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.780]   the celebration's on the court,
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.060]   then you move it to the locker room.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.520]   And we were in there just going crazy for hours.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.940]   Then we went over to the warehouse,
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.660]   had it popping in there.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.860]   But people don't even, it was weird
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.180]   because I don't know if you thought it was weird.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.300]   Like, that night we won the championship, it was so lit.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.220]   And then the next day, we had nothing to do.
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.820]   And then the day after that, there was nothing.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.260]   And then the parade was like, the day after,
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.520]   it was so, it was kind of weird.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.360]   - What was your favorite,
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.060]   just during the whole celebration,
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.520]   what was your favorite part about that?
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.360]   Was it the parade?
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.200]   Was it right after?
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.520]   What was it?
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.840]   - Man, the locker room was cracking.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.720]   - Cracking, it was like a club in there.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.440]   - It was, bro, it was like a club in the locker room.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.880]   It was just drenched, like, soaked in champagne.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.040]   Like, the alcohol, it was like Loki burning my nostrils.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.040]   Like, it was so, like, it was so thick.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.560]   Like, the cigar smoke was so thick.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.520]   And then I was lit.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.360]   I was lit on the way back to the, like, my place.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.520]   So, I jumped out of the car.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.520]   - I forgot about that, bro.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.640]   - I was through the streets.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.480]   - Yeah.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.760]   - And, like, people were double taking.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.920]   They were like, oh, shit, that's eight.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.120]   Yo, it's a G, really?
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.320]   So, it went from, like, 10 people to, like, 30 people
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.480]   to, like, 70 people, and we were in the streets.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.800]   And I'm, like, bodying people, like, trying to get through.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.320]   Like, a little kid walked up and I bodied him.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.080]   It was all bad, bro.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.800]   - You were a doulo, you were bodying someone?
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.160]   - Yeah, I had, like, a couple of my homies,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.120]   but they're, like, they're not, like, built like we are,
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.960]   you know what I mean?
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.520]   So, they're getting, like, kind of, like,
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.760]   moved around in the crowd.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.120]   Like, I'm moving, for real, like,
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.640]   I kicked a little kid over.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.560]   I know, I felt bad.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.400]   He looked up at me.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.000]   His eyes were, like, tearing up.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.320]   - Yo, 'cause you was really in the streets.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.680]   Like, you were out there, like.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.880]   - I was, like, I picked him up.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.000]   I was, like, where are your parents?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.800]   And then, like, kept it moving, you know what I mean?
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.200]   Like, it was nuts.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.520]   It got hectic, like, right as it was about to get, like,
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.840]   overwhelming, where it got to, like, 115 people.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.680]   - Yeah.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.800]   - Like, just, like, mob in the street.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.640]   - Yeah.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.480]   - Like, fireworks going off and stuff.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.200]   A media team, like, picked me up and I, like,
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   jumped in the car and, like, came to the lounge.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.040]   - Oh, for real?
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.880]   - Yeah.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.520]   - Man, bro, when I saw those videos, I was weak.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.240]   'Cause, like, only you would do that.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.400]   Only you, out of all people, would just be in the streets,
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.520]   celebrating with the fans.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.000]   I know, obviously, they really appreciate it.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.800]   AG's a man of the people.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.000]   For those of you that don't know, like,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.480]   that's just your personality.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.320]   So, that was dope.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.600]   But I saw the videos, like, people doing, like,
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.840]   pull-ups on the light poles.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.680]   - That's cracking.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.720]   - Man, it was crazy.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.960]   Like, that definitely was one of those memories.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.960]   It's crazy because, like, the celebration lasted,
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.920]   you get to the parade, and now, since then, it's been,
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.760]   can they repeat?
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.000]   Like, that's the topic, so quick.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.840]   - Yeah.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.160]   - You know, after we just did something so big.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.320]   But I feel like, even though we lost some key pieces,
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.880]   bruised Jeff, we still got a squad, you know?
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.880]   These young guys, we got a lot of young guys who can hoop.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.520]   Kind of, what do you think about our culture,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.320]   about our team, makes our team special?
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   - I mean, you guys have been with Mike Malone
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.000]   pretty much the whole time.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.680]   So, you know how he is.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.040]   So, you guys have an understanding of, like,
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.640]   what he's looking for, like, how he's gonna react,
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.760]   like, what's gonna trigger him, what's gonna set him off,
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.480]   you know, what's gonna keep him cool.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.840]   And then, it gotta come down to a big fella.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.120]   - Yeah, for sure. - Like, Yoke, like,
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.080]   Yoke's, he's a great leader.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.920]   - Yeah.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.760]   - You know what I mean?
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.960]   Like, when it comes down to it, like,
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.880]   he's there on time, every day he's on time,
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.440]   if not early.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.640]   He works out in the morning, he gets his reps in,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.720]   he goes to the game, does what he does in the game,
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.680]   and then, after the game, he lifts weights.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.520]   - Yeah.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.120]   - You know, so, like, he, like, works religiously
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.960]   every single day.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.520]   And he's humble, he shares the ball.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   So, when you have a two-time MVP
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.960]   and a one-time finals MVP that's so selfless,
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.600]   everybody else gotta, I mean, like,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   what else can you ask for?
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.240]   Everybody else gotta be selfless, too.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.960]   Like, if he can do it, everybody can be selfless.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.440]   So, I think, like, big fella is, he's a beast, bro.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.800]   - Man, unbelievable.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.440]   Like, I saw something the other day about, like,
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.400]   the tears of the best NBA players,
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.880]   and they had, like, Joker in a tear of his own.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.840]   I think that's the first time
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.240]   people have really put respect on him.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.600]   Like, that dude is unique, you know what I mean?
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.080]   He may not look the part,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.560]   but you watch him play night in, night out,
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.680]   that dude is the best basketball player
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.880]   I have ever seen in my life.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.520]   Like, from the passing to the, it's so crazy.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.840]   It's crazy what he can do.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.840]   And I think, like, early on in my career with the Nuggets,
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.640]   he really wasn't that into it.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.920]   Like, he was good, but he wasn't, like,
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.280]   he didn't care that much.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.680]   But he has grown every single year.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.080]   Like, even after his MVP year,
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.600]   how do you get better after an MVP year?
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.640]   And he did it.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.800]   Then he was back-to-back MVP,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   and now, how is he better this year,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.840]   after we just won a championship?
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.680]   - He's better.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.440]   - You go back to Serbia, and I just talked to him today,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.800]   he was like, man, brother, I was drinking six beers a day.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.560]   You know, he probably didn't touch a basketball.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.400]   Like, how do you get better from last year to this?
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.120]   And it's just, it's crazy.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.560]   But talking about Joker, you and him,
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.960]   y'all mesh, like, really well.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.760]   Like, as good a chemistry as me and Joker have,
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.720]   as good a chemistry as him and Jamal have.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.040]   You and his chemistry, you know, around the rim,
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.120]   you know, the lobs, when he's catching the pocket,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.400]   throwing you the lobs.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.200]   You compliment each other probably
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.320]   as good as any two players in the league.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.320]   How do you think you guys developed that?
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.440]   And is it just, like, your games,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.240]   or did it happen over time?
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.320]   Are you guys having conversations?
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.760]   I know y'all sit right next to each other in the locker room, so.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.480]   - I just like to play the right way,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.760]   and I think he likes to play the right way, too.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.080]   So that's like a mutual understanding.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.520]   Right off the rip, like, okay,
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.280]   if you're open, I'ma hit you.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.800]   You know, if you make this cut, I'll find you.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.760]   You know, if you don't shoot this, you be patient,
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.880]   the ball will come back around to you.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.680]   Stay open, keep your hands ready.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.400]   And I think that helped.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.080]   I used to play point when I was growing up.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.360]   He's, like, basically a point center.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.680]   So, you know, you got, like, your front court,
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.240]   kinda think like a back court.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.520]   - Yeah, in fact, that's true.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.200]   - So we're kinda, like, on the same page,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.560]   like, on the same wave when it comes to that.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.440]   And that helps out a lot.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.880]   - That makes sense, that makes sense.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.480]   One thing about you is you stay off of Instagram
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.720]   for the most part, you know.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.880]   Me and you both kinda do that in spurts.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.200]   You get on, you get off.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   What's your reasoning for that?
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.720]   And then my follow-up question is,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.400]   how do you deal with the criticism versus the praise?
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.600]   Like, there's so much now that we have to deal with
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.000]   in the NBA now, even more than guys in the past
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.840]   had to deal with.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.440]   Like, if I go through my DMs right now,
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.200]   half of 'em are people that do the sports better.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.040]   - That parlay, huh?
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.760]   - And it's, like, it's either,
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.520]   bro, you just made me so much money, thank you,
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.360]   you're my favorite player now, da-da-da-da-da.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.840]   Or it's, go kill yourself, I hope you tear an ACL,
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.600]   I hope you never, like, it's the craziest,
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.560]   I'm both sides of the, I'm both sides of the scale.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.520]   - You're not joking, that's not an over-exaggeration.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.840]   - I hope you tear your ACL, I hope you never--
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.680]   - I hope you die.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.480]   - It's the craziest of, like, I'm looking at my DMs,
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.160]   I'm like, yo, so for a lot of people that can make you
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.080]   kinda, like, wanna stay out the spotlight,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.800]   kinda get off of the 'gram, like,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   what's your reasoning for that?
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.000]   And then how do you deal with people like that?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.160]   Because I really think the sports betting stuff
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.520]   is a bad place our game is going,
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.440]   because these people would really be mad, bro.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.120]   Like, you, if you, you may have a great game, 25 and 10,
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.000]   but they had you getting, you know, 25 and 11 or something,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.120]   and now they're really hot, like,
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.560]   they really lost some money 'cause of you,
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.400]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.160]   So how do you deal with all that?
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.320]   - Man, that's, that's big, man, that's really big,
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   it's a part of it now, it's a part of today's game.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.220]   Like, somebody was like, yo, I lost my apartment on you.
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.640]   Today, I was, or after the Knicks game,
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.080]   I like, I played really bad.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.920]   - Yeah.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.720]   - I seen that, and I was like,
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   ain't nobody tell you to bet your apartment on me
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.560]   in the first place.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.400]   - So it don't faze you for real.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.220]   - Doubt me.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.060]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, for real.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.560]   - Why you putting where you live up on a basketball game?
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.400]   - Yeah.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.840]   - Nah, figure out, first off,
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.440]   figure out a better hustle than that.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.280]   - Yeah.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.120]   - Well, I think of it like, like the trolls,
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.520]   like you said, like the criticism and like the praise.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.280]   - Yeah, how do you balance it out and how do you,
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.200]   is that why you stay off of social media a lot?
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.120]   - I think of it like, I think of it like salt and sugar.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.840]   Too much of either will kill you.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.680]   - Yeah.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.760]   - You know what I mean?
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.880]   So people will tell you, you're the best, you're the best,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.240]   you're the best, you're the best, you're the best,
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.320]   you're gonna get soft.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.360]   - Yeah.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.840]   - If you buy into that, if people say,
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.160]   you're the worst, you're the worst, you're the worst,
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.920]   you're the worst, you're gonna get like cynical,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.600]   or you're gonna get like discouraged.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.580]   - Yeah.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.380]   - That's kinda why I stay off of Instagram.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.220]   - Yeah.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.440]   - Just because, you know, Instagram allows
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.760]   people that don't know you, don't care about you,
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.260]   really idolize you.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.100]   - Yeah.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.960]   - It gives them access to you to say whatever
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.160]   they'd like to say to you.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.000]   - Right.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.080]   - And you know, you go through that and you read it.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.760]   You know, I, I don't know, bro,
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.800]   I'm not really rocking with IG like that.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.640]   - Yeah.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.520]   - But it's good for like, you know,
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.120]   it's good for like marketing.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.400]   You know, my agency wants me to be on there,
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.640]   but it's like really distracting.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.200]   I see things that aren't for me.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.760]   - It's distracting and it's like,
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.000]   people think because you making all this money
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.800]   and you live a good life and you live in a nice place,
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.920]   that certain things don't affect you,
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.280]   but everybody is human.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.580]   And when people, you know, it could be a nobody.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.320]   When they're praising you, you know, you appreciate that.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.320]   If someone on the street, good game, Mike,
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.300]   like I appreciate that.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.160]   But also on the flip side, when people,
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.920]   even if they have nothing to do with your life,
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.360]   if you're reading enough of the negative stuff,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.760]   it affects you, bro, we're all human.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.720]   So I totally agree with you.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.280]   - Plus like the trolls on the same side,
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.400]   like the same person, like the internet gangster,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.000]   like they're just gonna like say something like,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   "Man, you suck, you're the worst basketball player ever."
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.840]   - Yeah.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.660]   - Over the keyboard.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.500]   If they see you in person, they're gonna be like,
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.920]   "Oh my God, Michael Porter, please,
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.200]   can I get an autograph?"
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.040]   So it's like, it's a little phony, bro.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.580]   There's a facade, there's a facade to social media.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.960]   - Big facade, and it's crazy 'cause that's such a big part
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.040]   of the world we live in now.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.440]   But speaking of social media, one of your last posts was,
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.180]   you know, you on your birthday, you was in a helicopter.
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.940]   Man, in some place, but off of the court,
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.480]   people don't know how dope of a dude you are,
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.880]   but you're one of a kind, you know,
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.040]   out of all the guys on our teams,
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.660]   you're one of those dudes who really lives life
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.500]   to the fullest, you know?
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.840]   - I appreciate that, Mike.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.040]   - In the off season, you traveling, you know,
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.080]   you're riding your motorcycle around town,
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.520]   you've got the warehouses that is some of the dopest spots
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.800]   I've ever seen, but like, who are you as a person
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.640]   off the court that people probably don't know about?
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.560]   Like, what's some of your hobbies?
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.040]   - Man, the motorcycle.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.880]   - Yeah.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.920]   - I love riding the bikes. - You be on there.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.760]   - That's fun.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.360]   You know, I don't do it too much during the wintertime.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.600]   I'll ride a little bit during the summertime.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.160]   I mean, I just, I want to experience what life has to offer.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.000]   - Yeah.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.880]   - You know, and be grateful doing it,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.120]   and like, you know, just experience.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.400]   I guess that's what it comes down to.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.880]   I love to travel, like you said,
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.560]   go see different cultures, eat different foods.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.600]   - Yeah.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.880]   - Go turn up at different spots around the world.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.500]   - And you sometimes go, like, solo.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.080]   - Yeah, yeah, I'll go dolo or meet somebody out there.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.920]   - Yeah.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.640]   - You know, like, I just spent,
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.120]   I spent, like, maybe six weeks in Spain this past summer.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.480]   I just got, like, a little house out there.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.920]   It was working out,
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.960]   and just immersing myself in the culture.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.200]   I don't know, man.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.160]   I just like to have fun, you know.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.000]   - That's dope.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.320]   - I like to have fun.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.320]   - You, where were you in that picture
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.680]   with the helicopter, and how did that even,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.920]   'cause some people seen that, and I'm like,
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.240]   man, how did he even arrange that?
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.360]   Where were you, and what was that all about?
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.040]   - I'm gonna give you the play, bro.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.880]   Give you the whole play.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.800]   You go to Geneva, right?
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.640]   - Yeah.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:49.200]   - Go get you a couple watches in Geneva, it's clean.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.160]   I picked up a couple of Pateks and a Rollie.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.480]   - They real, or they fake?
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.320]   - Nah, they real.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.560]   - Oh, okay, okay.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.160]   - China boys, though.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.600]   - China boys be having a fake one?
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.920]   - China boys be a little suspect.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.600]   But, yeah, you go to Geneva,
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.640]   and then there's a hotel in a place called Val's.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.240]   I forget exactly what the hotel's called,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.320]   but they'll send you a helicopter to Geneva,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   pick you up in Geneva, fly you to basically the Swiss Alps,
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.000]   and then it's a hotel that's tucked in the Swiss Alps.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.520]   Just spent my birthday there, 'cause I had been working,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.920]   so I wanted to go to a spa, basically.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.040]   - Yeah, and relax.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.680]   - Yeah, and just relax, so we kicked it,
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.880]   and then we took the helicopter.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.480]   When we landed in Val's, there was a black car
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.680]   waiting for us, it was clean.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.240]   Like, the helicopter just landed off the pad,
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.040]   hopped in the black car, and then later that day,
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.280]   or the next day, actually, we hopped back in the helicopter,
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.480]   and we went up to the Alps and had a little picnic
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.560]   on the Swiss Alps.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.760]   - You and who?
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.400]   (laughing)
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.240]   - Me and--
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.400]   - And your homeboy?
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.440]   - Me and the Jane of my Tarzan.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.080]   - Okay, that's tough.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.640]   Is she still the Jane D. of Tarzan?
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.480]   - Yes, she is.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.800]   - Okay, that's lit.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.520]   Man, so now that you've been around the world
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.280]   and you've seen so much, experienced so much,
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.000]   what do you wanna do after hoop?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.900]   I mean, this isn't gonna last forever.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.560]   You know, you made a ton of money hooping,
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.400]   we won a championship, you know.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.920]   You've accomplished a lot in your career,
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.360]   and we got a lot more to accomplish,
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.480]   but it's not gonna last forever.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.800]   So, after this, what you think you wanna do?
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.520]   I feel like you'd probably just be one of them dudes
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.360]   that's just gonna be chilling, traveling, enjoying life.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.400]   But correct me if I'm wrong, what do you wanna do?
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.760]   - Well, I still want to, I mean,
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.400]   between now and the time I retire,
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.280]   I wanna continue to acquire skills, you know,
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.460]   for off the court.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.760]   Whether it be learning a different language,
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.880]   or learn how to code, or finance, or law, you know.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.400]   So learn different languages that can open doors
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   and pathways in different respected careers.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.040]   Yeah, I mean, the traveling and the chilling,
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.760]   I feel like it's gonna get boring.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.600]   - You think so?
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.360]   - After like, maybe like two years, three years.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.200]   - Yeah.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.920]   - You know, we're competitive, we like stuff.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.520]   We like to like, go get it, you know what I mean?
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.840]   We like to hustle, you know, that's why we've gotten
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.840]   to the place that we're at, is 'cause we like to hustle.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.600]   So I feel like that hustle is gonna trigger.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   So, you know, right now, my brother and my sister,
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.640]   they've created a sports agency,
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.280]   and a media agency, a conglomerate.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:41.200]   And it's a startup, so they're starting to build that out.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.640]   Hopefully by the time I retire, you know,
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.760]   there'll be a place for me in that company.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.600]   - Yeah.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.760]   - And I can do like, sports and entertainment,
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.780]   marketing and media conglomerate.
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.920]   I think that's a way to stay around the game.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.760]   - Yeah.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.360]   - And also help up and coming kids that may not have
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.800]   the right representation, or might not have
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.400]   the right people around them.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.800]   And then put the right people around them
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.120]   so that they can succeed, and that they can in turn
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.840]   make buku bread in the NBA, and give back to their family,
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.680]   and pay it forward.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.080]   So, good way to stay around the game,
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.960]   and help kids coming up.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.800]   - 100%.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.720]   - That's what I'm thinking.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.560]   - That's dope, yeah.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.800]   I wanna talk to your brother more about that agency.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.120]   In five, no, I'm gonna say in 10 years.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.200]   'Cause for people that don't know AG,
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.160]   he's a young player, you know what I'm saying?
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.760]   He kinda, he got the juice, he be,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.600]   he's the dude, you know, around Denver, but everywhere.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.120]   You know, he's the dude everywhere we go.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.520]   This is the dude, you know, the females love him, all that.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.160]   In 10 years, do you see yourself settled down with a girl?
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.680]   Do you, what's your views on marriage?
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.200]   Do you think you'll ever settle down or not?
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.840]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.400]   I don't know, man.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.560]   - I'ma settle down.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.760]   I'll definitely settle down.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.000]   - In 10 years, you think you'll be married?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.320]   - Yeah, in 10 years.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.840]   I think I'll be married in five years.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.440]   - You the type, if you meet a girl,
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.720]   and you really clicking with her,
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.840]   like, it probably wouldn't take you long to be like,
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.000]   nah, I just wanna marry this girl.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.600]   - Yeah, I'll lock in.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.960]   I mean, I've been in the NBA since I was 18.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.800]   - Yeah.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.640]   - You know what I mean?
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.480]   So, I grew up in this.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.560]   I've seen the ins and outs.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.120]   I've done this, that, the third.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:20.960]   - Yeah.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.320]   - You know, all of that, it's exhausting.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.160]   - Yeah.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.000]   - You in a different page.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.920]   - Being in the streets, being in the streets is exhausting.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.000]   - I'm sure.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.120]   - Being outside, it's tiring.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.120]   - I'm not saying marriage isn't tiring and exhausting
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.920]   in its own right, you know?
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.160]   It is work.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.320]   But if you find the right woman,
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.480]   it can be completely empowering.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.840]   - Yeah.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.480]   - What's a king without a queen?
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.600]   (laughing)
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.440]   It's real.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.280]   - Dude.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.120]   - It's real.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.160]   - Dude got some knowledge on him, don't he?
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.920]   So like, what would it take for you
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.880]   to settle down with a girl?
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.400]   Like, what is your ideal type of a woman?
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.240]   - Mm, mm.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.360]   Very like, caring.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.200]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.400]   - Very nice.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.480]   Very intelligent.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.720]   Very real, down to earth.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.440]   Good head on her shoulder, good family background.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:20.720]   Beautiful, and would make a good mother, you know?
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.560]   - Good facts.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.960]   - I think that's what it comes down to.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.720]   - It's crazy, 'cause most of the dudes in the league,
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.640]   like, it get hard because most of the dudes
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.880]   that are married, kind of in our profession,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.640]   they kind of met their girl in high school,
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.120]   and it was their childhood sweetheart
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.840]   who they got married to.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.560]   Guys in our position, it's hard, like,
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.880]   once you have what you have and you are who you are,
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.120]   to meet a female who you can like, trust and who you--
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.400]   - Man, check this out.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.640]   - But look, he be going overseas,
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.240]   and he told me you gotta go find one overseas.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.320]   - Yeah, they know football over there,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.160]   you know what I mean?
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.320]   They know soccer players, they don't really know
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.160]   basketball players like that.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.080]   - Yeah.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.320]   - Check this out, I went on a date
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.560]   with this girl one time.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.160]   I forget where we were going.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.000]   Where was it at?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.160]   Might've been in like, Chicago or something like that.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.760]   We went on a date.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.360]   I got to the spot, right?
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.800]   We were just sitting at the bar,
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.600]   waiting for our table, getting drinks, whatever.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.000]   She opened up her phone.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.360]   The last thing she had on her phone
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.720]   was Aaron Gordon's network.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.680]   - You know what I'm saying?
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.720]   See what I'm saying, bro?
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.560]   - You feel me?
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.240]   I was like, yo, this is wild, yo.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.360]   - And females are smart these days
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.160]   because they can put off an image
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.200]   to where like, they don't care about that,
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.160]   they're not in it for the bread.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.680]   They just have your best interest at heart,
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.840]   but man, deep down somewhere,
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.000]   like, if you was just a regular dude,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.560]   who knows if she'd be messing with you.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.320]   So how do you think you can tell them?
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.880]   - Like, I'm trying to tell you this right now.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.320]   Just like you said, like, when you get to this level,
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.840]   there's certain girls that mess with you just for,
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.640]   you know, like, the clout, the money,
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.000]   that thing, the security.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.480]   But no, there are real ones.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.800]   You know, there's real ones out there.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.680]   - I'm going overseas.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.200]   I'm traveling with you.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.120]   Yourself coming summer.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:10.960]   We going overseas.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   - Come on.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.320]   - We going to find us some twins.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.760]   (laughing)
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.320]   - Are you getting married?
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.400]   - I'm going to be married.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.920]   If I had to predict it,
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.480]   I'd probably get married before you.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.880]   I'd probably be married, if I had to guess,
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.520]   in, what am I, 25?
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.320]   I'll be married by the time I'm 29.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.160]   - You think so?
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.000]   - I'll meet a girl.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.840]   - That's good.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.600]   - I'll meet a girl in the next couple of years.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.440]   - That's good.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.440]   - And then call it a day.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.280]   - Yeah.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.120]   - And I think so.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.240]   'Cause my younger brothers, like Jontae,
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.120]   my younger brother, Jontae,
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:45.960]   he's married.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.600]   He's 22.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.440]   He's 23.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.320]   He just had his birthday today.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.680]   And then--
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.520]   - Happy birthday.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.840]   - No, I think he's 24 now, right?
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.000]   He's 24.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.760]   And then my other brother, who's even younger than him,
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.920]   I think he's 22.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.960]   He's 22?
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.280]   COVID?
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.560]   He's about to get married.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.400]   So I'm 25.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.720]   I'm the older brother and I'm, you know,
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.120]   I feel like I'm the most immature.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.200]   'Cause they found their lady.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.320]   - I know, but they don't got access like you.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.280]   - They do though.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.600]   They be having Jonts.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.440]   - Yeah.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.280]   - Yeah.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.400]   - They got access like you though, bro.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.560]   - Nah, probably not access like me.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.680]   But still, I gotta settle down, man.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.600]   I'm on the same page as you.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.720]   You know, this year we kind of locked in a little bit more.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.360]   We're not going out as much.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.880]   We're not staying out as late.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.080]   - It's true.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.120]   - I asked you before the podcast what you was doing today.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.560]   You said you're going back to the crib
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.440]   and getting in some, what was it called?
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.280]   Me time?
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.120]   Me work?
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.800]   - It's just like, I don't know.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.000]   I guess I call it my work.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.120]   You know, it's called like man's work.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.960]   That's like what the OG used to say back in the day.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.080]   Like, I gotta do the man's work today.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.480]   But the man's work, it's not man's work.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.640]   It's everybody work.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.200]   It's like reading, writing, prayer, meditation.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.080]   Like just making sure that you're doing the work,
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.840]   the internal work, you know?
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.120]   You gotta do the internal work.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.160]   That's how you win on the outside.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.480]   Everything else like comes to fruition
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.640]   when you like take care of the inside.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.480]   - 100%.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.600]   Yeah, that's something I'm really realizing too.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.360]   I'm paying attention more internally,
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.120]   emotionally, mentally more than I ever have in my life.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.040]   'Cause everybody needs to do it.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.560]   But especially in the day and age we live in,
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.760]   you know, you gotta find yourself and find your purpose.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.560]   So that's my last question for you, bro.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.160]   What do you feel like your purpose is on this earth?
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.360]   You know, besides being a great basketball player,
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.920]   what do you feel like all-encompassing is your purpose?
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.760]   Why are you here?
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.720]   - Man, this is like the pageantry question right here.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.400]   (both laughing)
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   Honestly, it would have to be education,
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:54.040]   education reform, like the curriculum in America.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.280]   That's probably what I'll probably concert my efforts to
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   when I'm done.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.680]   Like I'll take all my money,
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.520]   try and make like a private school or something like that.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.120]   Like how LeBron did with the I Promise.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.560]   Like he set like a great foundation,
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.160]   a great blueprint for the rest of us.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.360]   I'll probably do something like that
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.120]   and create a curriculum where you're teaching kids like
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.880]   to know themselves, you know?
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.120]   To know themselves from a young age,
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.200]   to be independent thinkers from a young age,
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.320]   law, finance, all the things that you need in real life
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.320]   so you're not just like drifting through life.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.200]   - Yeah, you making life happen
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.120]   instead of letting life happen to you.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.200]   - Facts, exactly.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.800]   So just trying to figure out a different way
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.000]   for kids to be educated.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.840]   - That's dope, bro.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.680]   I feel that for sure.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.520]   And if I can ever invest in what you got going on,
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.760]   let me know 'cause that's dope.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.520]   I've got some other stuff that I,
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.120]   but that's a dope vision.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.520]   And I feel like out of anyone,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.720]   you make that crack, you know?
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.440]   - Yeah, my grandpa was like a superintendent of a school
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.200]   or of a school district after he left the military.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.000]   So, you know, it's in the DNA, you know?
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.120]   It's like as a teacher and as an educator.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.920]   So I don't know, maybe bring that back around.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.760]   - That's dope.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.400]   What about you?
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.320]   - Man, my purpose?
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.520]   I don't know, I ask everybody else this question
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   and I don't even know for sure what mine is.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.640]   That's why I'm doing some of the journaling stuff.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.640]   I'm trying to figure it out.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.880]   Like, man, every day,
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.880]   regardless of a good game or bad game,
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.920]   what can I cling on to as like my purpose?
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.080]   Like what's gonna make me wanna wake up in the morning
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.120]   and motivate me besides just being a great basketball player?
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.760]   And you know, I got passions.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.560]   I think it's, man, just being like real authentic
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.920]   and inspiring people to,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.320]   I just feel like that's one of my gifts is like,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.960]   is just being like authentic
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.160]   and like not being afraid to speak my mind in certain areas.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.480]   And I think, I mean, you know me, I'm a man of faith.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.320]   You know, I believe in God.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.320]   I feel like through all of our different people's talents,
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.840]   at the end of the day, like our goal,
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.280]   like our purpose should be to point people, you know,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.240]   to God and inspire people in that way.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.280]   So that's my purpose.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.200]   I just don't know how to really execute it all the way.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.720]   Like we got all this money, you know what I mean?
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.320]   And it's great, but what can I do with this money
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.360]   to actually make a difference?
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.920]   Like, I don't need 10 cards.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.600]   I don't need 10 cards.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   It's fun to, for me, it's fun to experience things.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.840]   It's fun to make sure my family's straight,
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.160]   but what can I actually do?
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.040]   That's why, like I always tell you,
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.240]   like I appreciate how you actually make something happen
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.080]   with your money.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.840]   You know, you went and did the,
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.680]   sorry, I'm messing up the mic.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.920]   You went and did something.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.080]   You did the warehouses.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.360]   You know, you want to open up the lounge.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.480]   You want to do the school.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.320]   Like for me, I'm trying to figure out
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.440]   what can I actually do to like make a difference?
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.840]   So, you know, you a couple of years older than me,
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.400]   but that's kind of what I'm working on.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.280]   That's why I'm spending time doing the journaling
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.600]   and all that, 'cause that's why I ask people.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   Every episode, I ask people like,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.720]   what do you feel like your purpose is?
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.560]   'Cause I'm trying to,
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.720]   that's what I'm trying to figure out right now.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.040]   - That's a deep question, man.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.560]   I think if you ask God, God'll give you the answer.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.160]   - Facts. - You know.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.080]   - Facts.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.240]   - He's gonna tell you right every time.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.080]   Ask for that clarity.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:12.920]   Ask for the answer today.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.880]   He's gonna tell you right.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.720]   - 100%, man.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.480]   Well, you know I appreciate you hopping on.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.680]   I know you don't do the podcast too often,
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.200]   but this has been good.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.200]   It's been insightful.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.840]   People don't know AG off of the court,
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.000]   but this is the man right here.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.520]   Probably my best friend on the team.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.920]   My light-skinned brother, so.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.920]   - This my twin right here.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.760]   - You know what I'm saying?
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.600]   So I appreciate you.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.440]   Curious Mike out.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.600]   (upbeat music)
