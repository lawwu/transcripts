[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.640]   - Welcome back to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.740]   I'm here with my guy, A.G.
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.840]   A.K.A. one time champion, A.K.A. Tarzan.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.920]   (laughing)
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.680]   Man, so I want to start off like in the hoop space
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.680]   and then we'll kind of transition to off the court stuff.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.200]   But you came to Denver, I want to say two, three years ago,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.080]   probably three years ago now.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.200]   You came from Orlando.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.120]   - It's gone quick.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.760]   - Yeah, it really has.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.200]   What was the difference to you from, you know,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.440]   hooping in Orlando?
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.520]   We've talked about it a little bit,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.960]   but like now playing in Denver,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.320]   playing for a winning team,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.280]   competing for a championship and all that.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400]   - Man, it was felt, it felt like,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.780]   well the spacing on the floor was way different.
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.780]   Like being able to play between you, Jamal and Joker.
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.560]   - Yeah.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.440]   - And like people have forgot about me.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.880]   Which is cool, yeah.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.560]   So like I'm just getting in where I fit in.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.120]   I'm getting easy layups.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.600]   Everything that I got in Orlando,
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.280]   it was like, yo, that was tough.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.120]   - That's a tough bucket.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.940]   - Tough bucket.
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.840]   Like everyone was like, damn, that's a tough bucket, A.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.880]   That's a tough bucket.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.760]   And that was tough.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.600]   That was tough.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.440]   - Yeah.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.480]   - When I came to Denver, it was like,
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.840]   okay, that's an easy, easy two, little back cut.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.240]   I felt like playing in between y'all three,
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.440]   we can't lose, bro.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.280]   - Yeah.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.120]   - Like.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.560]   - You over there, you were like, you were the man.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.600]   You know, the go-to scorer.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.880]   That's why everything was so tough.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.480]   You know, teams, you know, game planning for you
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.940]   and you're like the man.
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.360]   And over here, you're obviously a big part
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.520]   of what we got going on,
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.000]   but you got so many good players on our team.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.600]   So, you know, when they're worried about you,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.540]   I'm getting an open three.
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.480]   When they're worried about me or KCP in the corners,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.580]   you're getting a dunk.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.600]   Was it hard to transition from being the man over there
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.560]   to kind of like filling a role over here or no?
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.580]   - Nah, not at first, not at first.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.240]   Just 'cause, I mean, I get to play my role.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.080]   - Yeah.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.400]   - You know, I get to play the dunker.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.720]   I get run outs, cuts, lobs.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.420]   I can just, you know, shoot like spot ups.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.620]   You know, like I can like fill in the gaps.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.460]   - Yeah.
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.300]   - You know what I mean?
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.120]   Which is perfect for me.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.960]   That's how I like to play.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.160]   We move the ball here.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.760]   The open man is the right man.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.160]   And then, like y'all are so talented.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.380]   Y'all are so skilled.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.960]   Like, I'm not even worried like what shots you guys take.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.680]   - Don't say y'all, you got it too.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.040]   - But it's true though, bro.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.000]   Y'all are like, it's different.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.400]   It was just like a different level of talent.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.240]   - Yeah.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.520]   - Coming from Orlando to Denver.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.720]   It just was, the culture was already there.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.040]   The skills that you guys had, the talent.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.400]   It was just different, bro.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.680]   - Yeah, talk a little bit about like the mentality
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.600]   and the difference between being on a winning team
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.440]   versus not.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.680]   'Cause you know, we all grew up,
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.400]   everyone in the league grew up being a man
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.960]   and they probably won tons and tons of games.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.320]   But you get to the NBA and depending on where
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   you get drafted, you might be on one of those teams
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.260]   that really doesn't win like a whole lot of games.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.600]   And I feel like a lot of players kind of develop
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.940]   the mentality of like, man, this is just what it is.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.780]   I'm chilling.
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.320]   Like my team's not probably gonna make the playoffs.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.120]   We definitely not winning the championship.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.840]   I'm gonna just show up to work and kind of leave.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.940]   And we've talked about that before,
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.320]   how, man, y'all weren't even really tripping.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.880]   Y'all would just show up to work and then hop in your whips
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.560]   in the 80 degree weather in Orlando.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.560]   - That's real, bro.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.400]   - That's crazy.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.320]   - That's real.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   Charles Barkley, he was talking to my dad.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.120]   And he was like, you know, if you're gonna lose,
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.160]   Orlando's not a bad place to lose it.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.240]   - Facts.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   - It's 80 degree weather.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.520]   So people were coming in, kind of just like
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.200]   showing up, doing their job,
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.320]   hopping back in there like drop top or whatever,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.160]   you know what I mean?
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.880]   Going back home and enjoying the city.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.920]   Orlando's a great city when it comes down to it.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.600]   - You got the crib out there.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.520]   - Yeah, it's an underrated city.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.560]   But just like the culture, it just,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.920]   it wasn't a winning culture.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.640]   Like I think they're getting it together now.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.400]   You know, they're starting to get it together.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.800]   They're a good team now.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.600]   But when I was in Orlando,
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.820]   shoot, it was six different coaches.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.640]   - How many years?
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.460]   Every year?
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.480]   - Yeah, I had five different coaches in six years.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.440]   And four different GMs.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.760]   And so there was no stability.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.400]   It was like you were a rookie every year.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.600]   You were having to like try and prove yourself.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.360]   - Different plays, different strategies, that's tough.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.960]   - It was tough, bro, it was tough.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.520]   And try and like lead the organization
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.880]   in the right direction.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.880]   And it was difficult, bro.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.120]   - Yeah, that's crazy to think about.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.480]   Yeah, so now you in Denver,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.200]   and we, you know, just came off of a chip.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.440]   What was your favorite, you know, moments in the playoffs?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.360]   Did you always kind of feel like,
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.680]   man, like we are for sure winning a championship?
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.160]   Or kind of what was your like mentality in the playoffs?
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.080]   For me, it felt like,
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.200]   except for that Suns series when they tied it up 2-2,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.800]   I was kind of like, man, like nobody's touching us right now.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.560]   Like that's how it felt for the most part.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.000]   Minnesota's a good team and they're balling this year.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.240]   But that series, you know, they got one game.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.280]   I kind of felt like we always were in control a little bit.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.440]   But what was your favorite moments
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.640]   from the playoffs in that championship run?
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.320]   - Man, my favorite moments?
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.040]   I always have to say that was a great run, man.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.320]   We were real dominant.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.240]   - Yeah.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.480]   - We lost four games.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.000]   - One in Minnesota, two Suns, one Miami, yeah.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.120]   And really like could have won all those games.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.680]   - We really, yeah, right.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.040]   - Book and KD like dominant,
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.640]   they were dominant in those two games that they won.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.040]   Minnesota, that game that they won, it went into overtime.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.720]   That was one of my favorite moments of the playoffs.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.600]   That Minnesota, the game that we lost in,
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.160]   we were down like 12 or something like that.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.560]   - We were like a minute and a half, two minutes.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.400]   - Tied it up.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.240]   That was crazy.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.440]   I was like, oh, okay, we're serious.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.680]   Like we got no quitting us.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.280]   Like we could really do this.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.760]   That was a, and then like, you know,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.000]   obviously just winning it, bro.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.080]   Like the champagne showers is so sick.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.040]   - We was in the locker room.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.880]   Yeah, people don't know.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.320]   We were in the locker room for hours on hours.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.600]   Like after we won the tip, you know,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.800]   the celebration's on the court,
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.040]   then you move it to the locker room.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.520]   And we were in there just going crazy for hours.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.920]   Then we went over to the warehouse,
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.680]   had it popping in there.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.880]   But people don't even, it was weird
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.160]   because I don't know if you thought it was weird.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.280]   Like that night we won the championship, it was so lit.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.200]   And then the next day we had nothing to do.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.800]   And then the day after that, there was nothing.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.280]   And then the parade was like, the day after,
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.520]   it was so, it was kind of weird.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.360]   - What was your favorite,
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.080]   just during the whole celebration,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.520]   what was your favorite part about that?
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.360]   Was it the parade?
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.200]   Was it right after?
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.600]   What was it?
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.840]   - Man, the locker room was cracking.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.720]   - Cracking, it was like a club in there.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.440]   - It was, bro, it was like a club in the locker room.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.880]   It was just drenched, like soaked in champagne.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.040]   Like the alcohol, it was like Loki burning my nostrils.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.800]   Like it was so-- - Yeah, in the air, bro.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.040]   - It was so thick.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.560]   Like the cigar smoke was so thick.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.520]   And then I was lit.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.360]   I was lit on the way back to my place.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.520]   So I jumped out of the car.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.640]   And I was through the streets. - I forgot about that, bro.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.480]   - Yeah.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.760]   - And like people were double-taking.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.920]   They were like, "Oh shit, that's eight."
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.120]   I was like, "Gee, really?"
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.320]   So it went from like 10 people to like 30 people
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.720]   to like 70 people.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.760]   We were in the streets and I'm like bodying people,
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.760]   like trying to get through.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.320]   Like a little kid walked up and I bodied him.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.080]   It was all bad, bro.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.760]   - You were a dolo, you bodied yourself?
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.160]   - Yeah, I had like a couple of my homies,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.720]   but they're not like built like we are, you know what I mean?
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.760]   So they're getting kind of like moved around in the crowd.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.600]   Like I'm moving.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.680]   For real, like I kicked a little kid over.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.520]   I know I felt bad.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.360]   He looked up at me.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.120]   His eyes were like tearing up.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.320]   - Yo, 'cause you was really in the streets.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.640]   Like you were out there.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.880]   - I was like, I picked him up.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.000]   I was like, "Where are your parents?"
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.800]   And then like kept it moving, you know what I mean?
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.200]   Like it was nuts.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   It got hectic.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.640]   Like right as it was about to get like overwhelming,
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.840]   where it got to like 115 people,
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.480]   like just like mob in the street,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.480]   like fireworks going off and stuff,
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.920]   a media team like picked me up
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.200]   and I like jumped in the car and like came to the lounge.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.040]   - Oh, for real?
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.880]   - Yeah.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.520]   - Man, bro, when I saw those videos, I was weak.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.240]   'Cause like only you would do that.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.400]   Only you out of all people would just be in the streets,
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.520]   celebrating with the fans.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.000]   I know obviously they really appreciate it.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.800]   AG is a man of the people.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.760]   For those of you that don't know,
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.480]   like that's just your personality.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.320]   So that was dope.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.360]   But I saw the videos.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.880]   Like people doing like pull-ups on the light post.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.720]   - That's cracking.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.760]   - Man, it was crazy.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.120]   Like that definitely was one of those memories.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.000]   It's crazy because like the celebration lasted,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   you get to the parade and now,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.760]   since then it's been, can they repeat?
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.000]   Like that's the topic so quick.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.840]   - Yeah.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.200]   - You know, after we just did something so big.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.360]   But I feel like even though we lost some key pieces,
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.600]   Bruce, Jeff, we still got a squad.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.960]   You know, these young guys are,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.960]   we got a lot of young guys who can hoop.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.600]   Kind of what do you think about our culture,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.400]   about our team, makes our team special?
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   - I mean, you guys have been with Mike Malone
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.120]   pretty much the whole time.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.760]   So you know how he is.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.120]   So you guys have an understanding of like
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.720]   what he's looking for, like how he's gonna react,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.920]   like what's gonna trigger him,
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.120]   what's gonna set him off, you know,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.600]   what's gonna keep him cool.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.960]   And then it gotta come down to a big fella.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.800]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.120]   - Like he's a great leader.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.960]   - Yeah.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.800]   - You know what I mean?
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.920]   When it comes down to it, like he's there on time,
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.520]   every day he's on time, if not early.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.720]   He works out in the morning, he gets his reps in,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.800]   he goes to the game, does what he does in the game,
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.720]   and then after the game he lifts weights.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.560]   - Yeah.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.000]   - You know, so like he works religiously every single day.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.560]   And he's humble, he shares the ball.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.640]   So when you have a two-time MVP and a one-time finals MVP
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.240]   that's so selfless, everybody else gotta,
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.640]   I mean like what else can you ask for?
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.280]   Everybody else gotta be selfless too.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.000]   Like if he can do it, everybody can be selfless.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.440]   So I think like big fella, he's a beast, bro.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.840]   - Man, unbelievable.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.200]   Like I saw something the other day about like the tears
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.720]   of the best NBA players and they had like Joker
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.920]   in a tear of his own.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.400]   I think that's the first time people have really
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   put respect on him, like that dude is unique.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.920]   He may not look the part, but you watch him play
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.680]   night in, night out, that dude is the best basketball player
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.920]   I have ever seen in my life.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.560]   Like from the passing to the, it's so crazy.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.880]   It's crazy what he can do.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.880]   And I think like early on in my career with the Nuggets,
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.680]   he really wasn't that into it.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.960]   Like he was good, but he wasn't like,
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.280]   he didn't care that much.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.720]   But he has grown every single year,
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.120]   like even after his MVP year.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.680]   How do you get better after an MVP year?
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   And he did it.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.840]   Then he was back to back MVP.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.840]   And now how is he better this year?
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.920]   After we just won a championship.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.760]   - He's better.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.480]   - You go back to Serbia and I just talked to him today.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.840]   He was like, man, brother, I was drinking six beers a day.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.600]   You know, he probably didn't touch a basketball.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.480]   Like how do you get better from last year to this?
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.160]   And it's just, it's crazy.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.600]   But talking about Joker, you and him,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.960]   y'all mesh like really well.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.800]   Like as good a chemistry as me and Joke have,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.760]   as good a chemistry as him and Jamal have.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.080]   You and his chemistry, you know, around the rim,
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.160]   you know, the lobs, when he's catching the pocket,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.440]   throwing you the lobs.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.240]   You compliment each other probably
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.360]   as good as any two players in the league.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.240]   How do you think you guys developed that?
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.480]   And is it just like your games?
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.280]   Or did it happen over time?
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.360]   Are you guys having conversations?
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.720]   I know y'all sit right next to each other in the locker room.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.520]   - I just like to play the right way.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.800]   And I think he likes to play the right way too.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.120]   So that's like a, like a mutual understanding.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.360]   Right off the rip, like, okay, if you're open,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   I'm gonna hit you.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.840]   You know, if you make this cut, I'll find you.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.800]   You know, if you don't shoot this, you be patient,
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.920]   the ball will come back around to you.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.720]   Stay open, keep your hands ready.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.440]   And I think that, I think that helped.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.120]   I used to play point when I was growing up.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.400]   He's like basically a point center.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.760]   So, you know, you got like your front court,
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.280]   kind of think like a back court.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.560]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.240]   - So we're kind of like on the same page,
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.200]   like on the same wave when it comes to that.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.040]   - Yeah.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.480]   - And that helps out a lot.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.520]   - That makes sense.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.920]   That makes sense.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.520]   One thing about you is you stay off of Instagram
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.360]   for the most part.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.920]   You know, me and you both kind of do that in spurts.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.200]   You get on, you get off.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.240]   What's your reasoning for that?
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.760]   And then my follow-up question is,
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.440]   how do you deal with the criticism versus the praise?
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.600]   Like there's so much now that we have to deal with
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.040]   in the NBA now, even more than guys in the past
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.880]   had to deal with.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.480]   Like if I go through my DMs right now,
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.240]   half of them are people that do the sports better.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.080]   - That parlay, huh?
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.560]   - And it's like, it's either, bro, you just made me
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   so much money, thank you.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.400]   You're my favorite player now, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.480]   Or it's, go kill yourself.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.080]   I hope you tear an ACL, I hope you never,
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.080]   like it's the craziest on both sides of the scale.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.520]   - That's not an over-exaggeration.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.960]   - I hope you tear your ACL.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.520]   I hope you never-- - I hope you die.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.480]   - It's the craziest, like I'm looking at my DMs,
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.680]   I'm like, yo.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.640]   So for a lot of people, that can make you kind of like,
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.080]   want to stay out the spotlight,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.420]   kind of get off of the 'gram.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.760]   Like what's your reasoning for that?
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.000]   And then how do you deal with people like that?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.160]   Because I really think the sports betting stuff
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.520]   is a bad place our game is going
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.440]   because these people would really be mad, bro.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.120]   Like you, if you, you may have a great game, 25 and 10,
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.040]   but they had you getting, you know, 25 and 11 or something,
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.000]   and now they're really hot.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.560]   Like they really lost some money 'cause of you,
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.400]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.160]   So how do you deal with all that?
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.320]   - Man, that's big, man, that's really big.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   It's a part of it now, it's a part of today's game.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.760]   Like somebody who's like, yo, I lost my apartment on you.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.640]   Today, I was, or after the Knicks game,
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.040]   I played really bad.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.960]   - Yeah.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.760]   - I seen that, and I was like,
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.720]   ain't nobody tell you to bet your apartment on me
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.560]   in the first place.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.380]   - So it don't faze you for real?
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.220]   - Yeah, me?
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.040]   - Yeah, for real.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.560]   - Why you putting where you live up on a basketball game?
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.400]   - Yeah.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.840]   - Nah, figure out, first off,
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.440]   figure out a better hustle than that.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.280]   - Yeah.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.120]   - Well, I think of it like, like the trolls,
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.520]   like you said, like the criticism and like the praise.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.280]   - Yeah, how do you balance it out and how do you,
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.120]   is that why you stay off of social media a lot?
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.140]   - I think of it like, I think of it like salt and sugar.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.840]   Too much of either will kill you.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.680]   - Yeah.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.760]   - You know what I mean?
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.880]   So people will tell you, you're the best, you're the best,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.240]   you're the best, you're the best, you're the best,
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.880]   you're gonna get soft, you know?
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.300]   If you buy into that, if people say you're the worst,
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.620]   you're the worst, you're the worst, you're the worst,
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.920]   you're gonna get like cynical,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.600]   or you're gonna get like discouraged.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.580]   - Yeah.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.360]   - That's kind of why I stay off of Instagram.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.200]   - Yeah.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.000]   - Because, you know, Instagram allows people
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.760]   that don't know you, don't care about you,
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.240]   really idolize you.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.080]   - Yeah.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.960]   - It gives them access to you to say whatever
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.180]   they'd like to say to you.
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.020]   - Right.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.120]   - And you know, you go through that and you read it.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.760]   You know, I, I don't know, bro.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.800]   I'm not really rocking with IG like that.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.640]   - Yeah.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.520]   - But it's good for like, you know,
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.120]   it's good for like marketing.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.400]   You know, my agency wants me to be on there,
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.640]   but it's like really distracting.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.200]   I see things that aren't for me.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.760]   - It's distracting, and it's like,
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.000]   people think because you're making all this money
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.800]   and you live a good life and you live in a nice place,
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.920]   that certain things don't affect you.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.920]   But everybody is human, and when people, you know,
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.600]   it could be a nobody.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.320]   When they're praising you, you know, you appreciate that.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.360]   If someone on the street, good game, Mike,
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.300]   like I appreciate that.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.160]   But also on the flip side, when people,
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.920]   even if they have nothing to do with your life,
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.360]   if you're reading enough of the negative stuff,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.200]   it affects you, bro.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.020]   We're all human.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.680]   So I totally agree with you.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.200]   - Plus like the trolls on the same side,
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.360]   like the same person, like the internet gangster,
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.000]   like they're just gonna like say something like,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.840]   "Man, you suck.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.000]   "Like you're the worst basketball player ever."
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.840]   - Yeah.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.660]   - "Over the keyboard."
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.500]   If they see you in person, they're gonna be like,
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.840]   "Oh my God, Michael Porter, please.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.160]   "Can I get an autograph?"
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   So it's like, it's a little phony, bro.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.320]   There's a facade.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.560]   There's a facade to social media.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.400]   - Big facade.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.920]   That's crazy 'cause that's such a big part
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.000]   of the world we live in now.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.560]   But speaking of social media,
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.760]   one of your last posts was you on your birthday.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.140]   You was in the helicopter.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.540]   Man, in some place.
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.400]   But off of the court, people don't know
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.440]   how dope of a dude you are,
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.840]   but you're one of a kind.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.000]   Out of all the guys on our teams,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.640]   you're one of those dudes who really lives life
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.600]   to the fullest.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.800]   - I appreciate that, Mike.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.000]   - In the off season, you're traveling.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.040]   You're riding your motorcycle around town.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.440]   You've got the warehouses.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.920]   That is some of the dopest spots I've ever seen.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.640]   But who are you as a person off the court
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.720]   that people probably don't know about?
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.520]   What's some of your hobbies?
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.360]   - Man, the motorcycle.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.880]   I love riding the bikes.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.720]   That's fun.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.340]   I don't do it too much during the wintertime.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.640]   I'll ride a little bit during the summertime.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.160]   I mean, I just, I want to experience what life has to offer.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.000]   - Yeah.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.880]   - And be grateful doing it,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.120]   and just experience.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.400]   I guess that's what it comes down to.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.880]   I love to travel, like you said.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.440]   Go see different cultures, eat different foods.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.880]   Go turn up at different spots around the world.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.480]   - And you sometimes go solo.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.080]   I'll go dolo or meet somebody out there.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.920]   - Yeah.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.760]   - I just spent maybe six weeks in Spain this past summer.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.880]   I just got a little house out there and was working out,
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.880]   and just immersing myself in the culture.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.680]   I don't know, man.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.160]   I just like to have fun.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.000]   - That's dope.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.820]   - I like to have fun.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:30.200]   - Where were you in that picture with the helicopter?
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.560]   How did that even, 'cause some people seen that,
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.200]   and I'm like, man, how did he even arrange that?
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.320]   Where were you, and what was that all about?
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.980]   - I'm gonna give you the play, bro.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.920]   I'll give you the whole play.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.800]   You go to Geneva, right?
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.640]   - Yeah.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.640]   - Go get you a couple of watches in Geneva.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.200]   It's clean.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.180]   I picked up a couple of Pateks and a Roli.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.480]   - They real or they fake?
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.320]   - Nah, they real.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.560]   - Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.480]   - China boys.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.600]   - China boys be having a fake one?
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.920]   - China boys be a little suspect.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.600]   But yeah, you go to Geneva,
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.640]   and then there's a hotel in a place called Val's.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.220]   I forget exactly what the hotel's called,
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.320]   but they'll send you a helicopter to Geneva,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   pick you up in Geneva, fly you to basically the Swiss Alps,
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.000]   and then it's a hotel that's tucked in the Swiss Alps.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.520]   Just spent my birthday there, 'cause I had been working,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.960]   so I wanted to go to a spa, basically.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.040]   - Yeah, relax.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.680]   - Yeah, just relax, so we kicked it,
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.880]   and then we took the helicopter.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.720]   When we landed in Val's,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.680]   there was a black car waiting for us, it was clean.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.240]   Like the helicopter just landed on the pad,
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.040]   hopped on the black car, and then later that day,
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.280]   or the next day, actually, we hopped back in the helicopter,
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.600]   and we went up to the Alps
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.560]   and had like a little picnic on the Swiss Alps.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.800]   - You and who?
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.400]   (both laughing)
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.240]   - Me and--
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.400]   - And your homeboy?
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.480]   - Me and the Jane of my Tarzan.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.120]   - Okay, that's tough.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.640]   Is she still the Jane of your Tarzan?
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.800]   - Yeah. - Okay, that's lit.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.520]   Man, so now that you've been around the world
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.280]   and you've seen so much, experienced so much,
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.000]   what do you wanna do after Hoop?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.880]   I mean, this isn't gonna last forever.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.560]   You know, you made a ton of money Hooping,
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.400]   we won a championship, you know.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.920]   You've accomplished a lot in your career,
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.360]   and we got a lot more to accomplish,
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.480]   but it's not gonna last forever,
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.800]   so after this, what you think you wanna do?
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.520]   I feel like you'd probably just be one of them dudes
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.360]   that's just gonna be chilling, traveling, enjoying life,
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.280]   but correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.560]   what do you wanna do?
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.760]   - Well, I still want to, I mean,
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.400]   between now and the time I retire,
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.400]   I wanna continue to acquire skills for off the court,
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.760]   whether it be learning a different language,
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.880]   or learn how to code, or finance, or law,
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.400]   so learn different languages that can open doors
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   and pathways in different respected careers.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.040]   Yeah, I mean, the traveling and the chilling,
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.800]   I feel like it's gonna get boring.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.640]   - You think so?
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.360]   - After maybe like two years, three years.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.200]   - Yeah.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.920]   - You know, we're competitive, we like stuff,
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.520]   we like to go get it, you know what I mean?
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.000]   We like to hustle, you know?
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.960]   That's why we've gotten to the place that we're at,
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.840]   is 'cause we like to hustle,
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.600]   so I feel like that hustle is gonna trigger.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   So, you know, right now, my brother and my sister,
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.600]   they've created a sports agency and a media agency,
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.920]   a conglomerate, and it's a startup,
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.760]   so they're starting to build that out.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.680]   Hopefully by the time I retire, you know,
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.280]   there'll be a place for me in that company,
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.800]   and I can do like a sports and entertainment,
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.820]   marketing and media conglomerate.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.960]   I think that's a way to stay around the game.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.800]   - Yeah.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.440]   - You know, help up-and-coming kids
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.800]   that may not have the right representation,
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.400]   or might not have the right people around them,
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.800]   and then put the right people around them
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.120]   so that they can succeed and that they can, in turn,
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.840]   make buku bread in the NBA and give back to their family
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.080]   and pay it forward, so good way to stay around the game
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.960]   and help kids coming up.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.800]   - 100%.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.720]   - That's what I'm thinking.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.560]   - That's dope, yeah.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.800]   I wanna talk to your brother more about that agency.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.120]   In five, no, I'ma say in 10 years,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.200]   'cause for people that don't know AG,
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.160]   he's a young player, you know what I'm saying?
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.760]   He kinda, he got the juice, he be,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.600]   he's the dude, you know, around Denver, but everywhere,
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.120]   you know, he's the dude, everywhere we go,
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.520]   this is the dude, you know, the females love him, all that.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.140]   In 10 years, do you see yourself settled down with a girl?
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.680]   Do you, what's your views on marriage?
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.200]   Do you think you'll ever settle down or not?
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.800]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.640]   (laughing)
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.480]   I don't know, man.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.760]   - I'ma settle down, I'll definitely settle down.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.000]   - In 10 years, you think you'll be married?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.320]   - Yeah, in 10 years.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.840]   I think I'll be married in five years.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.440]   - You the type, if you meet a girl
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.720]   and you really clicking with her,
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.840]   like, it probably wouldn't take you long to be like,
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.040]   nah, I just wanna marry this girl.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.600]   - Yeah, I'll lock in.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.980]   I mean, I've been in the NBA since I was 18.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.820]   - Yeah.
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.640]   - You know what I mean?
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.560]   So I grew up in this, I've seen the ins and outs,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.120]   I've done this, that, the third.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:20.960]   - Yeah.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.320]   - You know, all of that, it's exhausting.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.160]   - Yeah.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:24.980]   - You in a different page.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.880]   - Being in the streets, being in the streets is exhausting.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.720]   (laughing)
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.540]   - I'm sure.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.140]   - Being outside, it's tiring.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.120]   - I'm not saying marriage isn't tiring and exhausting
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.160]   in its own right, you know, it is work.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.320]   But if you find the right woman,
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.520]   it can be completely empowering.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.840]   - Yeah.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.480]   - What's a king without a queen?
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.680]   (laughing)
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.520]   It's real.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.340]   - Dude.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.180]   - It's real.
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.160]   - Dude got some knowledge on him, don't he?
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.920]   So like, what would it take for you
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.880]   to settle down with a girl?
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.080]   Like, what is your ideal type of a woman?
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:04.720]   - Very like, caring.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.400]   Very nice.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.480]   Very intelligent.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.720]   Very real, down to earth.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.420]   Good head on her shoulder, good family background.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:20.720]   Beautiful, and would make a good mother, you know?
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.560]   - Good facts.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.960]   - I think that's what it comes down to.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.760]   - It's crazy 'cause most of the dudes in the league,
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.680]   like, it get hard because most of the dudes
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.920]   that are married, kind of in our profession,
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.680]   they kind of met their girl in high school
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.160]   and it was their childhood sweetheart
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.880]   who they got married to.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.600]   Guys in our position, it's hard, like,
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.960]   once you have what you have and you are who you are
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.200]   to meet a female who you can like, trust and who you--
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.440]   - Man, check this out.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.680]   - But look, he be going overseas
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.240]   and he told me you gotta go find one overseas.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.360]   - Yeah, they know football over there,
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.200]   you know what I mean?
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.360]   They know soccer players, they don't really know
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.120]   basketball players like that.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.960]   Check this out, I went on a date with this girl one time.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.200]   I forget where we were going.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.040]   Where was it at?
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.200]   Might have been in like, Chicago or something like that.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.800]   We went on a date.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.400]   I got to the spot, right?
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.840]   We were just sitting at the bar,
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.640]   waiting for our table, getting drinks, whatever.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.000]   She opened up her phone.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.400]   The last thing she had on her phone
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.760]   was Aaron Gordon's network.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.720]   - You know what I'm saying?
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.800]   See what I'm saying, bro?
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.640]   - You feel me?
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.240]   I was like, yo, this is wild, yo.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.400]   - And females are smart these days
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.200]   because they can put off an image
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.240]   to where like, they don't care about that,
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.200]   they're not in it for the bread.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.720]   They just have your best interest at heart,
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.880]   but man, deep down somewhere,
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.040]   like, if you was just a regular dude,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.560]   who knows if she'd be messing with you.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.320]   So how do you think you can tell them?
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.880]   - Like, I'm trying to tell you this right now.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.320]   Just like you said, like, when you get to this level,
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.840]   there's certain girls that mess with you just for,
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.640]   you know, like, the clout, the money,
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.000]   that thing, the security.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.480]   But no, there are real ones.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.800]   You know, there's real ones out there.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.680]   - I'm going overseas.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.320]   I'm traveling with you.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.160]   Yourself coming summer.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.000]   We going overseas.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.960]   - Come on.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.320]   - We going to find us some twins.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.560]   (laughing)
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.320]   - Are you getting married?
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.400]   - I'm going to be married.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.920]   If I had to predict it,
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.480]   I'd probably get married before you.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.880]   I'd probably be married, if I had to guess,
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.520]   in, what am I, 25?
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.320]   I'll be married by the time I'm 29.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.160]   - You think so?
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.000]   - I'll meet a girl.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.840]   - That's good.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.600]   - I'll meet a girl in the next couple years.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.440]   - That's good.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.440]   - And then call it a day.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.280]   - Yeah.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.120]   - And I think so.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.240]   'Cause my younger brothers, like Jontae,
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.120]   my younger brother, Jontae,
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.400]   he's married, he's 22, he's 23.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.320]   He just had his birthday today.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.680]   And then--
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.520]   - Happy birthday.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.840]   - No, I think he's 24 now, right?
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.840]   He's 24.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.760]   And then my other brother, who's even younger than him,
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.280]   I think he's 22, he's 22, COVID?
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.560]   He's about to get married.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.040]   So I'm 25, I'm the older brother.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.120]   And I'm, you know, I feel like I'm the most immature.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.760]   'Cause they found their lady.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.320]   - I know, but they don't got access like you.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.280]   - They do though.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.600]   They be having Jonts.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.440]   - Yeah.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.280]   - Yeah.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.440]   - They got access like you though, bro.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.600]   - Nah, probably not access like me.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.480]   But still, I gotta settle down, man.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.640]   I'm on the same page as you.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.760]   You know, this year, we kinda locked in a little bit more.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.400]   We're not going out as much.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.920]   We're not staying out as late.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.120]   - It's true.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.160]   - I asked you before the podcast what you was doing today.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.600]   You said you're going back to the crib
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.480]   and getting in some, what was it called?
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.320]   Me time?
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.160]   Me work?
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.840]   - It's just like, I don't know.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.040]   I guess I call it my work.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.160]   You know, it's called like man's work.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.000]   That's like what the OG used to say back in the day.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.120]   Like, I gotta do the man's work today.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.520]   But the man's work, it's not man's work.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.680]   It's everybody work.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.240]   It's like reading, writing, prayer, meditation.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.120]   Like just making sure that you're doing the work,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.560]   the internal work.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.880]   - Yeah.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.160]   - You gotta do the internal work.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.200]   That's how you win on the outside.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.520]   Everything else comes to fruition
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.680]   when you take care of the inside.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.520]   - 100%.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.680]   Yeah, that's something I'm really realizing too.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.440]   I'm paying attention more internally,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.080]   emotionally, mentally, more than I ever have in my life.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.120]   Everybody needs to do it,
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.640]   but especially in the day and age we live in,
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.840]   you know, you gotta find yourself and find your purpose.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.640]   So that's my last question for you, bro.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.240]   What do you feel like your purpose is on this earth?
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.440]   You know, besides being a great basketball player,
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.000]   what do you feel like all-encompassing is your purpose?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.840]   Why are you here?
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.560]   - Man, this is like the pageantry question right here.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.400]   (both laughing)
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:51.200]   Honestly, it would have to be education, education reform.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.040]   Like the curriculum in America.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.280]   That's probably what I'll probably conserve my efforts to
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   when I'm done.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.720]   Like I'll take all my money,
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.560]   try and make like a private school or something like that.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.160]   Like how LeBron did, like with the I Promise.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.560]   Like he set like a great foundation,
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.200]   a great blueprint for the rest of us.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.400]   I'll probably do something like that and create a curriculum
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.200]   where you're teaching kids like to know themselves,
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.160]   you know, to know themselves from a young age,
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.240]   to be independent thinkers from a young age,
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.840]   law, finances, all that,
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.320]   all the things that you need in real life.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.360]   So you're not just like drifting through life.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.240]   - Yeah, you making life happen
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.160]   instead of letting life happen to you.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.240]   - Facts, exactly.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.840]   So just trying to figure out a different way
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.040]   for kids to be educated.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:39.880]   - That's dope, bro.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.720]   I feel that for sure.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.520]   And if I can ever invest in what you got going on,
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.800]   let me know, 'cause that's dope.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.560]   I've got some other stuff that I,
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.160]   but that's a dope vision.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.760]   And I feel like out of anyone you make that crack, you know?
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.480]   - Yeah, my grandpa was like a superintendent of a school
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.240]   or of a school district after he left the military.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.040]   So, you know, it's in the DNA, you know?
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.160]   It's like as a teacher and as an educator.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.960]   So I don't know, maybe bring that back around.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.800]   It's dope.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.400]   - What about you?
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.360]   - Man, my purpose?
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.520]   I don't know, I ask everybody else this question.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   And I don't even know for sure what mine is.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.640]   That's why I'm doing some of the journaling stuff.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.640]   I'm trying to figure it out.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.880]   Like, man, every day, regardless of a good game or bad game,
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.920]   what can I cling on to as like my purpose?
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.120]   Like what's gonna make me wanna wake up in the morning
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.120]   and motivate me besides just being a great basketball player?
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.760]   And you know, I got passions.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.560]   I think it's, man, just being like real authentic
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.920]   and inspiring people to,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.320]   I just feel like that's one of my gifts is like,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.560]   is just being like authentic and like not being afraid
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.320]   to speak my mind in certain areas.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.480]   And I think, I mean, you know me, I'm a man of faith.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.320]   You know, I believe in God.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.360]   I feel like through all of our different people's talents,
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.840]   at the end of the day, like our goal,
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.280]   like our purpose should be to point people, you know,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.280]   to God and inspire people in that way.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.320]   So that's my purpose.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.200]   I just don't know how to really execute it all the way.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.720]   Like we got all this money, you know what I mean?
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.800]   And it's great.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.360]   But what can I do with this money
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.400]   to actually make a difference?
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.960]   Like, I don't need 10 cards.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.080]   I don't need 10, it's fun to,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.640]   for me, it's fun to experience things.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.880]   It's fun to make sure my family's straight,
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.200]   but what can I actually do?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.080]   That's why, like I always tell you,
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.240]   like I appreciate how you actually make something happen
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.080]   with your money.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.840]   You know, you went and did the,
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.720]   sorry, I'm messing up the mic.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.960]   You went and did something.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.120]   You did the warehouses.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.360]   You know, you want to open up the lounge.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.520]   You want to do the school.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.360]   Like for me, I'm trying to figure out
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.480]   what can I actually do to like make a difference?
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.840]   So, you know, you a couple of years older than me,
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.440]   but that's kind of what I'm working on.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.320]   That's why I'm spending time doing the journaling
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.280]   and all that.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.160]   'Cause that's why I ask people every episode.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.760]   I ask people like, what do you feel like your purpose is?
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.600]   'Cause I'm trying to,
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.760]   that's what I'm trying to figure out right now.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.080]   - That's a deep question, man.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.600]   I think if you ask God, God will give you the answer.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.160]   - Facts.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.080]   Facts.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.240]   - He's going to tell you right every time.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.080]   Ask for that clarity.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:12.920]   Ask for the answer today.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.880]   He's going to tell you right.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.720]   - 100%, man.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.520]   Well, you know, I appreciate you hopping on.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.680]   I know you don't do the podcast too often,
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.200]   but this has been good.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.240]   It's been insightful.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.200]   People don't know AG.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.000]   Off of the court, but this is the man right here.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.520]   Probably my best friend on the team.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.920]   My light-skinned brother, so.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.920]   - This my twin right here.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.760]   - You know what I'm saying?
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.600]   So, I appreciate you.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.440]   Curious Mike out.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.600]   (upbeat music)
