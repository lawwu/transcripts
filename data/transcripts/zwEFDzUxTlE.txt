[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   I absolutely do practice my question techniques in private.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.880]   When there's somebody that I meet and I don't think I'm ever going to meet them
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.480]   again, I just throw out a question approach to see how will they respond?
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.560]   I try to direct them.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.080]   Tell me what you were doing this weekend instead of, so what
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.040]   were you doing this weekend?
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.400]   I try it and see what happens.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.880]   If I try it on someone in person and it doesn't feel awkward and I don't see a
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.360]   distance in the conversation, I think it's a good technique.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.880]   Keep it in my, in my Google doc full of techniques for having better conversations.
