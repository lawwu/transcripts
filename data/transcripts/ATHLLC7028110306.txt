[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.700]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.440]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.540]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.340]   and each week I sit down with the world's best experts
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.440]   to learn the strategies, tactics, and frameworks
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.040]   that have shaped their success.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.440]   There's a common expression
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.840]   called drinking from the fire hose
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.840]   that sums up the way many of us experience information
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.140]   in today's world.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.340]   There's just way too much content to consume,
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.240]   whether it's videos, movies, podcasts, articles,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.400]   blogs, books, it keeps going.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.100]   And what do we do with all of this?
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.500]   How are we supposed to remember
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.700]   and use all of this information?
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.040]   David Allen, creator of Getting Things Done,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.460]   is famous for saying, "Your mind is for having ideas,
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.440]   "not for holding them."
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.300]   But how do we do that?
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.600]   So today I'm talking with Tiago Forte,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.740]   who's got a way for us to get those ideas out of our brain
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.240]   and into a reliable system for retrieval,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.240]   what he calls a second brain.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.340]   Tiago's become one of the world's foremost experts
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.900]   on productivity, teaching cohort-based courses
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.740]   on building a second brain for years.
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.000]   And now he put that information into a new book
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500]   that I loved called "Building a Second Brain,
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.640]   "A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.840]   "and Unlock Your Creative Potential."
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.100]   We're gonna talk about the four steps
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.260]   to having a highly effective second brain,
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.640]   why it's important to become more of a maker than a consumer,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.000]   why the most common way people categorize information
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.300]   might not be best,
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.400]   why you might not need to change the tools you're using
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.800]   to get started, and a whole lot more.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.860]   So let's get started.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.440]   Tiago, welcome to the show, and thanks for being here.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.600]   - Thank you, good to be here, Chris.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.440]   - So I already know that I'm a suboptimal note-taker,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.640]   but I did just scroll through my Evernote history
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.840]   this morning, and it looks like I've been doing it wrong
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.200]   since about July 4th, 2010.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.140]   So needless to say, I am very excited
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.740]   about this conversation, as much work as might be
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.640]   on the back half of this to try to put in a better system.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.480]   - Let's talk.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.180]   That's kind of how this all started.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.680]   In the early years, it wasn't about building a business,
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.800]   it wasn't about writing a book,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.100]   even having a course, it was just one very specific problem,
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.100]   which is what do you do with all this stuff
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.280]   in your Evernote inbox?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.880]   That was like the very, very first problem
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.380]   I was trying to solve.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.600]   - But before we get started, I just have to ask,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.300]   you worked with Kevin Chin on your studio, correct?
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.180]   - Yes.
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.080]   - It looks great.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.040]   For anyone unfamiliar, the Kevin we're discussing
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.640]   started this company called Dream Studio Course.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.100]   They have a course and optional hands-on support
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.040]   to help you build your home office into a studio
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.680]   that looks like Tiago's, it looks and sounds incredible,
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.380]   on video calls or meetings.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.100]   In fact, I'm about to swap offices
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.580]   with another room in our house,
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.300]   and I'm gonna use the course that Kevin created
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.300]   to make my setup 10 times better.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.780]   So if you're watching on YouTube,
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.780]   hopefully you'll see that upgrade in the future.
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.840]   And if that's interesting,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.900]   you should definitely check it out, DreamStudioCourse.com.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.700]   But I wanna start by sharing
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.700]   one of my favorite takeaways from the book.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.240]   You said, "To be able to make use
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.480]   "of the information we value,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.980]   "you need a way to package it up
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.540]   "and send it through time to our future self."
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.840]   So I think we're gonna talk a lot about the tactics,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.300]   but to kick us off, I'd love to talk about the why
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.600]   behind a second brain and what it might unlock
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.240]   for those future selves.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.500]   - Yeah, there's sort of three stages
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.640]   that people move through.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.600]   In the first one, they're just trying to solve a problem,
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.040]   and that problem is called information overload.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.340]   It's like a crisis, it's like a survival thing.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.800]   They are just trying to keep their head above water.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.100]   They're getting more emails, messages,
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.540]   seeing more social media posts,
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.980]   listening to more podcasts than they can even make sense of.
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.240]   It's, like you said, drinking from a fire hose.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.180]   And it is affecting their mental health,
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.100]   their ability to focus, their attention span,
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.980]   even their relationships, their career prospects.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.640]   It's like a real problem.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.500]   That is the beginning point, but not the end point.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.540]   That's just like the gateway.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.840]   That's like the doorway that leads to everything.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.580]   The other two stages, basically,
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.700]   they move on from there
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.640]   to just wanting to do their best work.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.980]   Once the background noise and the static
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.540]   of information overload starts to subside,
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.600]   well, what do you do with this newfound freedom,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.380]   this newfound bandwidth?
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.280]   You wanna do work that is more persuasive,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.800]   impactful, original, effective, profitable.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.240]   Like, whatever dimension you're measuring
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.040]   the quality of your work on, you wanna increase it.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.940]   And that's where having notes starts to become
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.380]   not just a way to offload stuff from your mind,
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.400]   but then to selectively re-onload,
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.640]   like take back some of the knowledge,
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.880]   some of the ideas that you actually wanna use
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.280]   to create things, to build, to write,
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.780]   to speak, to create.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.300]   And then eventually, when they really start to leverage
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.840]   and start to feel the second brain
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.340]   almost as like a cognitive exoskeleton,
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.240]   I almost think of like a mech warrior.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.640]   You get up in it, you put your feet in the boots,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.500]   and then you put your hands into the exoskeleton arms,
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.540]   and you're like, "Oh my gosh, the power!"
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.780]   Then what they really start to do
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.040]   is to advance their most important projects and goals,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.640]   like things that they say
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.540]   they've been wanting to do for a long time,
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.140]   goals that they've said they've been working on for years,
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.640]   but not really making any progress.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.040]   They start to make serious progress on those things.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.040]   That's the arc, the three-part arc
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.780]   that I see people move through as they build a second brain.
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.840]   - Promise this whole thing isn't me reading a quote.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.940]   I actually just have two,
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.200]   but I'm gonna read the second one.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.300]   And I think this sets the framework up for all of this.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.440]   You said the consumerist attitude towards information,
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.400]   that more is better, that we never have enough,
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.240]   and that what we already have isn't good enough,
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.080]   is at the heart of people's dissatisfaction
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.800]   with how they spend time online.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.640]   Instead of trying to find the best content,
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.280]   I recommend instead switching your focus to making things,
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.240]   which is far more satisfying.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.800]   There's a lot to unpack there,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.900]   but if I take what you just said and that,
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.640]   I have to wonder how much of this is valuable
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.540]   as a superpower for bloggers and podcasters and creators,
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.000]   or how much of that creation
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.140]   is something that applies to anyone in any profession?
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.480]   - Such a good question.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.840]   I think those groups you mentioned,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.400]   who I'll just call content creators, are the leading edge.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.380]   They're the leading edge.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.540]   They're the ones that they hear about a system like this one,
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.980]   they go, "Oh my gosh, this is what I needed yesterday."
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.000]   They're more aware.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.040]   They're more sensitive to what this would do for them.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.920]   But I guess my assertion, my hypothesis,
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   is that it's gonna spread.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.520]   That those are just the early adopters.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.040]   Those are the frontier people.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.200]   But that essentially the category of content creator,
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.460]   I think in the near future is gonna be meaningless.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.260]   Everyone is going to be a content creator.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.680]   Even the category of freelancer or entrepreneur
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.960]   is gonna start to become meaningless.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.740]   Even people in big organizations
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.820]   are gonna need the agency, the autonomy,
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.700]   the sort of self-determination
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.420]   that today entrepreneurs have.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.940]   I guess that's my view of the future,
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.420]   is a lot of these categories that we fit into today
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.860]   are gonna dissolve.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.020]   What I'm confident of is that we're gonna need
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.860]   to intake information, filter and curate it,
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.320]   the parts that actually enrich our lives and make us better,
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.560]   and then use it to either tell a story,
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.720]   send a message, create a document or a product or service.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.680]   I had this quote in my book too.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.200]   I think the process of creation
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.040]   is actually timeless and fundamentally human.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.120]   The medium changes.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.520]   Like today it's podcasting, tomorrow it's YouTube,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.960]   the next day it's TikTok.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.440]   But all humans are creators.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.880]   All humans are inherently creative, I think.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.840]   And eventually we're all going to use technology
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.320]   to do that more effectively.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.320]   - It's funny, as you were talking,
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.000]   I was just thinking, okay,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.240]   before I was officially a creator as a podcaster,
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.800]   I can think of all kinds of things from,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.320]   I put together a slide show
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.160]   at my grandparents' like 50th anniversary.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.300]   And it's like, that was something
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.160]   that was a collection of memories and emails and stories
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.520]   that I'd been collecting over time, but no organized way.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.520]   Or I've had professional jobs
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.560]   where you've given presentations
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.800]   about things that you've become an expert on.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.200]   When I was an investor, I became the ed tech investor
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.400]   'cause I'd invested in a handful of education tech companies.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.640]   And there were blog posts, there were articles
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   that only later I had to go back and be like,
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.400]   where was that thing that was so interesting?
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.160]   Because the partners were like,
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.560]   hey, can you talk about that industry?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.680]   So it made me realize there's full-time creator
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.720]   where creating content is the sole thing
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.080]   that is your income.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.220]   And then there's, I have a job to do X, Y, or Z,
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.520]   but within that job, I'm creating content,
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.160]   whether it's a sales pitch
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.000]   or whether it's a presentation to other employees.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.320]   I started realizing that
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.800]   even when I wasn't a creator per se,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.000]   I actually was in many areas of life
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.960]   and it would have been way more beneficial
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.320]   for me to have thought, where is this note?
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.400]   Where is this line from this book that I read?
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.840]   Where is this blog post or email going to go
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.040]   so that I can make the most value of it in the future?
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.880]   Sometimes known and sometimes unknown.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.080]   - Couldn't have said it better myself.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.280]   That's exactly how I think.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.760]   If you've ever given a presentation,
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.440]   made a PowerPoint and presented it to a few people,
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.320]   to me, right in that very common situation
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.000]   that almost everyone has faced,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.160]   all the elements are there.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160]   You had to capture, you had to organize information,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.440]   you had to distill it into a message, a point, an argument.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.520]   You had to express it, you had to present it.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.520]   Even if that was the only context
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.560]   that you ever used any of this,
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.320]   if your presentations to other people
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.040]   were 10 times more effective,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.280]   wouldn't that make a difference?
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.240]   Wouldn't that lead to better outcomes
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.280]   in whatever you happen to be doing?
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.560]   I can't imagine it wouldn't, it has to.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.560]   I really try to remove the emphasis on,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.400]   yeah, like you said,
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.560]   full-time professional content creators.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.840]   Those are very few in numbers
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.440]   and I wouldn't even recommend it to most people.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.080]   But we are all expressing ourselves.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.280]   That's the fundamental thing is self-expression.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.440]   - A big concept in the book is this code framework
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.520]   that you just glazed over very quickly.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.240]   But can we maybe walk through those four steps
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.560]   and maybe just start by just defining
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.680]   how you think of the definition of a second brain
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.840]   so people can have that before we step through it?
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.680]   - Sure.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.520]   Yeah, code is really the heart and soul
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.360]   of the building a second brain world.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.720]   It describes the creative process.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.960]   That's really what we're talking about here
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.240]   is your creative process
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.800]   and making it digital and technological.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.160]   Code was a discovery.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.800]   Like I remember I was in my apartment in Mexico City
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.000]   where I was living with my wife at the time
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.720]   and I wasn't even trying to like fit it into an acronym
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.560]   or into a word.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.200]   I was just like on a big sketch pad,
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.040]   I was just like writing different words
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.880]   and moving them around
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.160]   and then I suddenly saw code just pop out at me.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.400]   And I was like, oh wow, like it seemed to emerge.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.800]   And in my work it basically describes
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.760]   what is universal about the creative process.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.280]   A lot is particular.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.720]   There's a lot that changes person to person.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.600]   But any creative medium, any creative profession,
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.720]   any creative output that I see
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.680]   in some shape or form does four things
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.880]   which are the four letters of code.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.280]   Capturing information, which just means writing it down,
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.560]   documenting it, organizing it,
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.800]   which simply means adding some structure,
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.240]   some prioritization, some container.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.080]   Distilling, which just means boiling it down,
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.360]   refining it to its essence, to the takeaway,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.440]   to the action steps, to the punchline
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   and then expressing it through writing, through speaking,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.320]   through designing, through art, through music,
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.720]   some form of putting it back out into the world
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.040]   as your own interpretation.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.800]   - I have a bunch of questions on each of them.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.320]   But if we start in Capture,
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.200]   one of the things that I found fascinating
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.640]   when I first came across your work,
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.120]   I was like, oh, I am sure that Tiago's gonna have a,
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.680]   if you wanna capture, you've gotta use this tool.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.880]   And I was, I would say, pleasantly surprised
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.360]   that you said there's not a perfect app
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.720]   or software system that works
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.120]   and people shouldn't even necessarily maintain
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.040]   everything in one place.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.840]   That makes me think, okay, well, that's great
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.360]   because I probably have some already
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.000]   and it doesn't mean I'm doing it totally wrong.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.120]   But I think it can also be hard for someone listening
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.960]   to say, okay, I wanna do this.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.080]   I want a second brain.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.920]   What should I do?
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.600]   And it's kinda like, well, you can kinda pick and choose.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.400]   So maybe we start off with someone
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.920]   who's never really thought about this.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.640]   They've got a couple notes in Apple Notes
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.280]   or a Google Doc here or there.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.840]   And they're like, okay, I want a place to store information
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.800]   that I can access and benefit from
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.000]   through creative processes in the future.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.760]   Where do I start if I haven't even thought
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.120]   through this process in terms of tools?
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.440]   It doesn't have to be a specific one,
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.640]   but it seems it almost would be easier
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.520]   if you were like, the answer is download
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.760]   the Building a Second Brain note-taking app and here it is.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.280]   - I wish I could just say, you just download this app.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.400]   Now you have a second brain.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.600]   You don't even need to read the book.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.680]   Maybe one day we'll get there.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.880]   But yeah, with Capture.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.000]   I think the main thing here is people, for some reason,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.080]   always think about Capture as doing something new.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.080]   Okay, what is the new, new thing I'm going to do?
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.000]   But everything that I recommend that I teach, it's empirical.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.080]   It doesn't come from academia.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.360]   It doesn't come from a theory.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.600]   It doesn't start with sort of a concept.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.280]   It starts from coaching.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.720]   I just coach people, sit with them, talk with them,
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.560]   see what they're already doing that works.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.800]   And we sort of make small tweaks and changes and bottom up.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.280]   Instead of me coming in with this top-down framework
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.040]   saying you need to follow the framework.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.880]   And so what I would really recommend people do
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:36.880]   is just please look at the content you're already consuming.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.960]   If you changed nothing, how could you simply Capture,
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.960]   save the 1% most insightful ideas, quotes, takeaways,
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.240]   thoughts from what you're already consuming?
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.280]   Like no change.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.120]   Like what are you doing?
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.960]   Do you read books?
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.920]   Do you read articles, podcasts, audio books,
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.240]   conversations with people?
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.760]   You are consuming,
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.280]   even if you're the most anti-tech person ever,
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.640]   you have no social media accounts, you're a recluse.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.960]   You are consuming gigabytes of data per day in some way.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.440]   Capture that, start there.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.560]   And honestly, most people can stop there.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.280]   It's like the sheer volume is already so high of consumption.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.560]   You can just focus on capturing the 1%
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.080]   and never add any consumption ever.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.560]   In fact, most people should reduce it.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.280]   - It's interesting because I've heard you talk before
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.520]   and someone might listen to this and say, "Oh man."
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.840]   So Tiago is probably sitting there
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.960]   and throughout an entire day
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.080]   generating 10,000 notes of everything.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.400]   And I actually feel like you might capture less notes
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.280]   than many people doing this.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.320]   So how do you decide what is relevant enough
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.560]   or important enough to store?
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.760]   Because like you said,
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.720]   if we're all being exposed to gigabytes of information a day,
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.640]   it could be very easy to take that book you read
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.200]   and store a thousand quotes.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.560]   It could be very easy to take every post you read
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.720]   and store that.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.040]   Which I think honestly, looking back at my old Evernote,
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.880]   I was scrolling through it.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.640]   I was like, "Gosh, every time I read an article,
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.200]   I would clip the whole article."
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.040]   And I would just save this article to Evernote.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.600]   And then I just had a database of articles.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.960]   I didn't know what they were for.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.040]   And I think I was probably overzealous
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.960]   in my storing of information.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.240]   In an early day where like,
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.960]   "Oh, I didn't even know this was possible."
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.040]   For some reason, I guess in 2010,
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.120]   maybe I thought the article would be gone in the future.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.080]   So yeah, how do you decide what is relevant
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.440]   to put in a second brain?
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.520]   Because I guess the storage capacity is infinite.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.160]   So you could put everything.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.160]   - This is a real issue.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.040]   For the kind of person who is prone
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.280]   to this kind of behavior in the first place,
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.320]   they far more likely are saving far too much.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.800]   They're digital hoarding.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.400]   They're doing the digital equivalent
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.120]   of like those hoarding TV shows
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.760]   where you can't even open the front door
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.200]   because there's pizza boxes
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.960]   and just like crap piled in every spare place.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.760]   What's interesting is in the physical world,
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.200]   there's clear negative impacts
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.320]   like the ones I just mentioned.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.240]   In the digital world, you can actually convince yourself,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.520]   "No, this is good.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.800]   "I'm creating value.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.800]   "I'm acquiring real evergreen assets."
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   You're not, you're just like stockpiling a resource
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.080]   that the more you stockpile when it comes to information,
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.600]   the less valuable it is 'cause you can't find anything.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.960]   What is the point of 1,000 terabytes of data
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   if you can't even make use of it,
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.120]   if it's all just an endless sea of stuff?
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.160]   And so most of my techniques and my rules of thumb
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.440]   that I teach people are how to capture less,
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.120]   how to capture less, be more discerning, more picky.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.800]   Most people don't have a high enough standard.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.000]   They read something that sounds halfway interesting
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.120]   and they save it.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.400]   I try to save, and this is the end of a long journey.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.840]   I went through a period of hoarding
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.480]   and I think that's actually probably good.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.600]   Try to capture all the stuff.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.800]   See how that goes for you.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.560]   (laughs)
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.920]   When you discover, as I did,
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.480]   that it's hurting more than it's helping,
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.240]   you start to become so picky
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.560]   where I'll be reading a book and I'm like,
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.360]   is this a life-changing idea?
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.720]   Does this quote shatter my conceptions
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.560]   of how the world works?
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.200]   That is a high bar.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.560]   But the great result of that is I'll read an entire book,
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.560]   I'll think the book is great.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.840]   Five stars on Amazon, I'll have like five quotes from it.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.000]   That's how it should be.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.600]   The quotes are not everything
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.600]   that was even a little bit good in the book.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.360]   The quotes are just like a bookmark.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.480]   They're the digital equivalent
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.120]   of like having a book on your shelf.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.880]   I have one over here where there's like a little Post-it
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.280]   and you go, hey, I think there's something in that book
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.880]   because you can always go back to the book
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.160]   and then have all the details there.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.480]   All the notes, the quotes that you're saving,
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.560]   the only problem those are trying to solve
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.800]   is discoverability, is helping you rediscover
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.880]   and even remember that you once read a book about this.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.760]   On my same computer, as I'm working,
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.080]   I'll just do Spotlight, open up the Kindle app,
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.280]   go straight to that book,
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.920]   open the passage that I'm looking at
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.800]   and go right back to where I read that book
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.360]   like five years in the past
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.480]   and pick up where I left off five years later.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.040]   - One thing I obviously think I did poorly
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.280]   was saving articles.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.960]   I imagine if you're reading a blog post
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.080]   that's really life-changing, let's say,
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.440]   it would be save the quote, not the whole thing.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.280]   - Yes.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.320]   - And you can link back to the quote.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.760]   What are the tools, whether they're platform agnostic,
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.000]   meaning where the information's stored,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.120]   but they're just collection tools
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.520]   or platform tools that you think are
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.360]   maybe in the consideration set for people to know about?
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.600]   - I've tried countless capture tools
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.680]   and I've settled on just a few very simple ones
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.600]   that have just stood the test of time.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.560]   It comes down to paper notebooks.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.000]   There's some use cases that they simply can't be beat,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.760]   right, but then the second one,
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.160]   which is also the key to the first one,
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.120]   is a mobile app, right?
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.720]   After I take those notes on paper,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.080]   at the end of the day or the end of the week,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.800]   I use the Evernote mobile app,
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.560]   which has OCR, optical character recognition,
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.960]   snap a photo of that page,
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.520]   and now the paper notes have now become digital notes.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.640]   So that part is essential.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.640]   The notes app you use has to have a mobile app.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.000]   I'd say probably 30 to 40% of the total notes I take
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.440]   are opening on my iPhone, going into the mobile app,
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.040]   just typing an idea, typing a thought I had,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.400]   typing something I heard in a conversation.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.760]   A third one is if you can automate,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.960]   especially like long form reading is really powerful.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.520]   I use an app called Readwise.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.680]   Do you know Readwise?
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.520]   - I do.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.080]   It's funny 'cause I sometimes have read
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.520]   all across different platforms
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.400]   and it's not the best until you're like,
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.920]   Readwise is actually the first reason I said,
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.720]   you know what, I should just only read in the Kindle app.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.560]   - It's amazing.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.560]   I mean, nothing like this existed when I started.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.080]   Now it's a virtually completely automated solution.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   It's like a connector,
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.000]   like a bridge for anyone who doesn't know.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.120]   I'm reading on my Kindle on any device, by the way.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.560]   Sometimes I'm reading on the Kindle app on my phone,
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.240]   Kindle app on my iPad or an actual Kindle device.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.400]   I have three Kindles.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.960]   Anywhere that I make a single highlight within minutes,
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.960]   that highlight is routed.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.520]   It's imported from the book into my notes
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.800]   with no further action on my part.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.640]   It's like a miracle.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.480]   It's amazing.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.080]   And then that Readwise also works with the fourth one
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.680]   I was gonna mention, which is a Read Later app,
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.240]   which is really, really key.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.680]   This is kind of a surprise for people.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.520]   You do not wanna save anything to your second brain
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.600]   that you haven't consumed,
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.680]   that you haven't actually paid attention to,
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.040]   read and digested.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.160]   And the reason for that is when you encounter it later,
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.520]   you don't wanna come across a thing you'd say to be like,
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.360]   what the heck is this?
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.960]   I've never seen this in my life.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.520]   You wanna have a preexisting familiarity.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.120]   So what you wanna do is almost have like
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.960]   a little waiting room, like a little holding area
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.040]   before things get to your second brain.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.440]   And that is your Read Later app.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.040]   Something where you can keep a reading list
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.560]   of everything you say you wanna consume
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.000]   for later consumption.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.240]   - One of the ways I've done this,
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.320]   and I just implemented half of it this morning.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.400]   The first half was just bookmarking things on Twitter
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.280]   if I found something I wanted to follow up on,
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.700]   but I didn't wanna read now.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.600]   Now I have bookmark it to follow up on it
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.120]   and then like it.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.920]   And then I just set up a Zapier Zap
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.080]   that if I like something,
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.160]   it will auto import it into a database in Notion
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.200]   where I store a lot of my personal information.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.100]   I was like, getting ready for this interview.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.360]   I set this thing up this morning,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.480]   I hit the like button.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.880]   And then all of a sudden I was like, ooh.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.800]   And I was like, now I need to go process all the old ones.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.420]   'Cause a lot of my likes are things
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.960]   that I wanna follow up on and go back and see in the future.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.600]   So second process, I can't remember the browser.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.560]   There's a Chrome extension.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.760]   I wanna call it like Twittler or something
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.280]   that lets you basically download your likes on Twitter
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.800]   or your tweets as a CSV for importing somewhere.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.960]   So a lot of these tools work great in the future,
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.320]   but they don't work great for history.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.520]   So that was one that I found.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.560]   I wouldn't say it's like the most professional product,
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.200]   but it worked for exporting my likes into a CSV.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.020]   So I love that.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.200]   Yeah, Readwise is something that I feel like I need to adopt
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.440]   after thinking more heavily about this.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.920]   - Hey everyone, Amy here, Chris's wife.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.600]   I convinced him to let me do this today
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.040]   because I am truly obsessed with Viore
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.640]   and I'm so excited they're partnering for this episode.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.360]   Viore makes performance apparel
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.680]   that's designed to work out in,
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.900]   but also looks great in everyday life outside of the gym.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.300]   It is so versatile, buttery soft, and stylish
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.360]   that I wear it out to drinks with friends,
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.140]   on morning runs, to work meetings, and when I'm traveling.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.280]   Honestly, I'm decked out in Viore every single day
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.560]   because why choose between comfort and style
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.800]   when you can have both?
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.120]   Some of my favorites are the daily leggings,
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.600]   the mudra fitted tee, and the Sunday performance joggers.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.080]   In fact, if y'all do nothing else,
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.480]   get their Sunday performance joggers.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.640]   Hands down, they're incredible.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.240]   They come in men's and women's
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.940]   and they are the best article of clothing I own.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.640]   I've also gifted Viore to friends and family enough now
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.280]   to know that it's my go-to gift
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.500]   because it's always going to be a winner.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.360]   Pro tip with the holidays coming up.

[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.880]   - Science has shown that being charitable
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.880]   can actually have a huge impact on your happiness,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.240]   which is why I'm excited to be partnering with Daffy today.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.720]   They're a not-for-profit community
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.840]   built around a new modern way to give,
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.780]   and they have a mission I think we can all get behind,
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.880]   helping people be more generous more often.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.360]   Amy and I use Daffy for all of our giving
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.600]   because they offer an account
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   that makes it easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.620]   You can make a one-time contribution
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.120]   or you can set a little aside each week or month,
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.280]   and all your contributions are tax deductible,
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.300]   except you don't actually have to know
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.020]   exactly where you want to give the money right away.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.460]   In fact, you can make your tax deductible contribution now
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.700]   and invest that money into stocks or even crypto
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.380]   so it can grow tax-free
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.960]   and let you have more impact in the future.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.600]   Then, whenever you're ready,
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.340]   you can give to any of more than 1 1/2 million charities,
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.540]   schools, or faith-based organizations
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.360]   in a matter of seconds.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.880]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.820]   if you wanna start giving today,
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.500]   and for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.620]   you can get a free $25
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.960]   to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.960]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.900]   - Is your second brain Evernote
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.620]   or is Evernote a component of it?
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.380]   I think it's an interesting distinction
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.220]   between is one place the brain
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.320]   or is the brain the concept that has many pieces?
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.300]   - Your second brain
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.980]   is the complete ecosystem of apps that you use.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.540]   I think that is an important distinction.
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.380]   There never has been, never will be one app to rule them all.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.680]   It's just simply not realistic,
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.620]   and I don't think ever will be.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.620]   In fact, over time, both on an individual level
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.940]   and a society level,
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.540]   I think we're using ever more specialized tools.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.060]   As technology advances,
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.720]   you wanna use the right tool for the job.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.980]   Every tool is just a download in an app store away,
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.100]   so I think we're gonna use more things over time, not less.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.900]   So the technical definition,
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.040]   I almost think of it like a solar system.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.140]   The sun is your Notes app.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.660]   That is the central, the neural center.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.220]   That is the gold mine.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.420]   That is where the long-term repository
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.580]   of the most interesting, high-potential ideas.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.400]   But then orbiting the Notes app might be any number.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.060]   You might have task managers, cloud storage drives,
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.700]   drawing apps, voice memo apps like Otter.ai.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.860]   There's a whole ever-evolving cast of characters,
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.760]   but I would say your Notes app is the central one.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.580]   - You just mentioned Otter, which is a fantastic app.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.760]   Open it up, turn on transcription,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.780]   it basically records and transcribes
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.700]   everything you're talking about.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.460]   Obviously, maybe depending on your state,
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.260]   but I would encourage you to let everyone know
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.260]   that you're recording them
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.860]   and you might legally be required to,
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.340]   but it's been really valuable in a lot of cases for me.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.900]   Are there other apps that you've found
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.380]   that maybe not everyone knows about
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.500]   that are like, look, you might not need this,
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.960]   but ReadWise Otter, worth sharing
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.940]   because it kind of is an unlock
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.460]   that most people haven't tried before.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.300]   - Yeah, there is.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.740]   We have on our website a free,
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.940]   I think it's called the Second Brain Resource Guide
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.400]   that has this little embedded Airtable database
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.500]   with like all the apps that we like.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.540]   And it's by category.
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.980]   So you can filter like show me only read later apps,
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.100]   show me only database apps like Airtable.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.100]   You can kind of filter it.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.520]   But let's see a few that I use.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.900]   Otter is a great one.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:11.220]   Air, A-I-R-R for capturing snippets of podcasts
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.220]   is another excellent one.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.940]   I really like Miro, which is a mind map.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.500]   It's a mind map app that also has collaboration features.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.260]   So like once you've created your mind map
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.460]   and you wanna just share it, it's like two clicks.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.300]   Let's see what else.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.100]   Procreate, I really like to draw,
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.420]   but I like to draw digitally so that I can save it.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.460]   Procreate is like the most powerful,
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.340]   full feature drawing app for the iPad.
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.460]   I think it works primarily with the Apple Pencil.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.660]   I think if I made the full list,
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.180]   there's probably like 25 apps
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.260]   that are in the knowledge management category that I use,
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.300]   which is kind of wild.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.300]   That may sound like a lot,
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.020]   but go through those multiple screens of your iPhone,
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.780]   look in the applications folder of your computer,
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.420]   and most people listening to this
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.940]   are probably not far off from that.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.580]   - I'll definitely link to that page
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.620]   in the show notes for sure.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.900]   Are there any tools you've found
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.300]   that make it easy to search across these?
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.980]   I've got Evernote, I've got Google Drive.
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.380]   A friend of mine started this company
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.060]   and then very quickly ended up getting acquired somewhere
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:06.900]   and it didn't go anywhere.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.940]   But it's like, gosh, I got these Dropbox files,
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.100]   I've got Apple Notes.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.420]   Is there any way to find things amongst all of them?
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:18.100]   - So this is one of the longest standing kind of needs.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.420]   And what's so interesting about it
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.420]   is there's been a number of very strong contenders.
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.180]   There was one called Found that I really liked
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.220]   'cause basically you hit a shortcut on your keyboard,
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:33.140]   this panel slid in from the left side of your screen,
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.180]   and then you could connect.
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.660]   It was like Evernote, Google Drive, Gmail, Dropbox.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.580]   You know, at the time, all the things I was using.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.820]   And then with one search, it was kind of like Spotlight,
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.340]   but for your entire digital life.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.820]   But they got shut down.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.780]   Then there was another one called CloudHQ
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.500]   that got like acquired.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.140]   It's like there's been this series of things.
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.460]   I think the issue with it is
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.180]   it's so dependent on other apps.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.660]   It's the webbing, it's the missing links between them
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.460]   that is what this tool is adding.
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.820]   I think for that reason, they have trouble raising funding.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.580]   They have trouble building a real business behind it.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.900]   It kind of stays as this like background utility
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.740]   that is super useful for a small number of people
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.660]   that actually care about things like knowledge management,
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.540]   but it never quite seems to take off.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.220]   - The one I just looked up that a friend of mine started
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.780]   was called Command E.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.580]   And that was like his vision was like building an Alfred
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.380]   or a Spotlight search for everything.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.100]   And then they were acquired by Dropbox.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.860]   And it says they might relaunch soon.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.700]   I hope they do.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.780]   I will say one that's worked not across everything,
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.260]   but I found that the Apple Files app on the iPhone,
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.900]   you can actually, I think sync to Google Drive and Dropbox.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.860]   So in the Files app, you can authorize the Files app
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.820]   to load into Google Drive and Dropbox.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.580]   I can't remember how well the search works
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.300]   because if you wanna attach a file on your iPhone,
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.300]   it's like you go through the Files interface
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.300]   and the Files interface can interface with other services
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.900]   and search amongst them.
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.820]   But it doesn't search within Notes and within Evernote
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.100]   and within all these things.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.660]   So there's not a perfect solution.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.500]   If anyone listening wants to start that company,
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.380]   let me know, I would love to be involved.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.700]   It sounds like Tiago would love this to exist as well.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.300]   How do you feel about in this kind of new world
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.100]   where you said in the future, we'll have people that,
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.700]   you're not gonna call yourself an entrepreneur
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.340]   because everyone will have that component of their life
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:25.140]   or a creator, merging business and personal knowledge.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.660]   Do you keep separate personal and work emails,
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.220]   separate personal and work notes,
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.620]   or are they all merged together
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.940]   become kind of one second brain or two?
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.180]   - Yeah, they're mostly merged together,
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.940]   but there is what I would call sort of a porous border.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.940]   There is a little bit of separation.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.140]   It's not because there's anything so sensitive or anything,
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.140]   it's just so that I can be in a different state of mind.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.300]   What I really think of is the areas of responsibility,
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.940]   which is one of the organizational categories I have.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.380]   I'm in such a different state of mind
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.900]   when I'm looking at the areas of the business,
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.960]   finance, legal, marketing, operations,
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.220]   versus the areas of my life,
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.220]   which are like the dog, the kid, the wife,
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.280]   health, personal finances.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.100]   They're similar in that they're like the departments
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.500]   of the business versus the departments of life,
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.060]   but I just wanna be in very different places.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.980]   The only thing I do is I just add a little FL,
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.660]   which is Forte Labs, the name of my company,
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.880]   as a little prefix before the business areas.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.900]   And that just serves as a signal to me
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.140]   that if I'm in personal life mode, I just ignore those.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:29.160]   And if I'm in business mindset, I just ignore everything else.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.340]   - And that brings me to another question,
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.140]   which is about the way you organize this.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.340]   I think one of the things that makes my notes,
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.420]   and I saw, I think it was you and Ali Abdaal
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.180]   were talking about your systems,
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.280]   and I think you were going through his second brain,
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.660]   which included a bunch of folders on Apple Notes.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.100]   And I was like, oh my gosh,
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.500]   it never even crossed my mind to create folders.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.700]   And that led me down this,
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.500]   okay, my new thing is I need to start organizing better.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.820]   And you mentioned how a library
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.340]   is often organizing their books by subject,
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.660]   and that that's probably not the most optimal way
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.800]   to organize the information you're collecting.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.440]   Talk me through the optimal way,
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.900]   or at least a optimal way
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.140]   to organize information you are collecting.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.600]   And I guess that's the O.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.660]   - Yeah, this is the O.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.580]   So my solution, my recommendation
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.480]   for how to do the O, organize, is called PARA.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.000]   It's P-A-R-A.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.320]   I'm a big fan of four letter frameworks, as you can see,
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.480]   which is really the heart and soul
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.520]   of the building of second brain methodology,
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.620]   like how this all started.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.360]   The first thing that I created,
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.560]   the first technique that really did well, was PARA,
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.500]   which is a solution to how to organize,
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.500]   at the time, Evernote, and since then has expanded
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.280]   to how to organize really any digital place,
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.720]   any digital location.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.200]   We can get into those letters if you want,
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.260]   but the main principle is what you said.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.520]   For some reason, I think it's because of our exposure
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.760]   to libraries or to school,
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.200]   where you organize things in notebooks,
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:53.080]   like history, English, French, by subject.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.920]   When we enter the professional world
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.180]   and we go to organize information,
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.020]   that's what we do.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.680]   A big insight that I had was that that is pointless.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.680]   There's really no point to that.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.440]   What is the point to categorizing
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.760]   hundreds of things you've read about psychology?
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.600]   Psychology is far too vast.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.880]   It makes sense in a library.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.760]   There's a few rows on the shelf that are psychology,
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.000]   but in your personal life,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.660]   that is far too broad of a category to be useful.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.100]   You have to be more narrow.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.320]   You have to be more use-specific.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.640]   And it turns out the context of use
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.080]   that is most relevant to most people is projects,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.120]   project-based work.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.480]   That's the future that we're all heading towards
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.120]   as a society, as an economy, is project-based work.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.080]   So I say organize your notes and files digitally
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.440]   according to your active projects.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.580]   - The A is areas.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.680]   Would an area be a place where you're not yet sure
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.000]   if there's a project, like my kids?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.280]   It's like, I don't necessarily have a project.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.760]   I know one of the things that I enjoyed reading
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.460]   was you gave an example of your second brain.
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.960]   I'll even link to this in the show notes,
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   as it related to sleep training.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.280]   And it's funny because in preparation,
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.280]   I was researching this and while I'm reading it,
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.440]   my wife's texting me and she's like,
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.680]   we need to start sleep training our second daughter.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.640]   And I tried to play it off.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.760]   Like, I was like, oh, I'm actually reading
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.280]   about sleep training right now.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.200]   It turns out I'm actually preparing for an interview,
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   but I'm doing two things at the same time.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.320]   Would parenting be an area
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.600]   or would you try to create a project like sleep training
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.520]   or can you start with one and then branch off within it?
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.560]   - That's exactly right.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.400]   Projects don't really emerge from nothing.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.300]   They don't just like appear out of the blue.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.000]   They tend to emerge from areas of like interest
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.560]   or activity in your life.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.840]   You have just things going on.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.280]   You're kind of paying attention to some aspect of your life
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.280]   or your job or your business,
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.120]   and then a project emerges, right?
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.260]   You realize, oh, we need to do X.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.640]   We need to accomplish X.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.920]   And that's the moment that you need
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.280]   a little bit more structure.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.040]   You need a little bit of scaffolding
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.100]   to actually produce an outcome.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.560]   And that is when a project emerges,
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.360]   like you said, from ongoing areas of your life.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.960]   - I don't wanna spend too much time on everything
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.140]   'cause there's an entire book and it's really good.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.160]   So just hit quickly maybe on resources and archives.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.500]   I actually have a question about archives,
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.240]   but I feel like if we're gonna mention all three,
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.120]   we should just at least explain the other one.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.960]   So resources and archives.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.240]   - So projects and areas,
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.280]   the P and the first A of Para are all about your life.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.120]   Those are completely mapping
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.760]   to what matters to you right now.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.280]   The resources is kind of everything else.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.760]   It's like almost like miscellaneous.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.840]   Everything you are just reading about,
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.800]   learning about, topics you're exploring,
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.100]   things you're keeping an eye on, trends.
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.720]   It's like I'm proactively saying all of that matters,
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.680]   keep it, but it is third place.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.000]   It is third priority after both your projects and your areas.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.920]   So it could be topics, coffee, gardening,
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.880]   artificial intelligence, productivity, just anything.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.080]   And then the archives is like the cold storage.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.520]   It's like the basement.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.400]   Anything from the previous three categories
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.760]   that is no longer active, that is no longer relevant,
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.160]   don't delete it.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.380]   You have effectively infinite storage space these days.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.760]   You never need to delete anything,
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.040]   but you don't want it cluttering
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.240]   and confusing your active priorities.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.680]   So just demote it all the way down to archives,
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.160]   which you never look at
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.600]   unless you specifically want to see something.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.920]   - I was going through Evernote and I was like,
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.020]   gosh, what are all these notes?
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.280]   Over a thousand notes, what are they?
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.360]   And I came across, I think it was like maybe 2014,
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.880]   which is a window of time in my life
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.420]   where someone asked me to join a fantasy football team,
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.720]   which was a huge mistake
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.000]   for someone who loves spreadsheets and optimization.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.040]   And for two years, every time football season rolled around,
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.560]   I was like, I could not consume enough content.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.960]   I didn't actually care about any of the teams,
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.440]   whether they won, whether they lost, it didn't matter.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.880]   But I was interested in every aspect of fantasy football.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.760]   I'd be sitting down with my father-in-law
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.420]   who loves football, not for fantasy sake.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.640]   And I'd be like, oh, this is so awesome.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.800]   And then he'd be like, yeah, that's great.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.620]   And then like the next minute,
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.880]   the other team would do something.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.880]   I'm like, this is awesome too.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.560]   He's like, I don't understand what's going on.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.840]   You're rooting for both teams.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.800]   I'm like, I just care that this guy catches this ball.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.040]   Everything else in the game is useless.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.960]   That needs to be in the archives,
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.760]   which is all I could think of scrolling through Evernote
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.020]   was that I didn't have it organized in any place.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.840]   And at the time it was a project
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.200]   and now it needs to be set off in cold storage.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.440]   Is there a process by which you go through all of this,
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.040]   maybe weekly, monthly, annually to try to decide,
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.480]   okay, this needs to move around.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   Is there a way you maintain things
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.200]   before going on to any other projects?
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.240]   - There is, yeah.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.280]   There's almost like second brain maintenance,
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.880]   the same way you scheduled maintenance for your car
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.120]   to keep it operating.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.440]   There is similar things you should do for your second brain.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.080]   There's different ways we could approach it.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.560]   Some of those are on the calendar, like scheduled.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.960]   Weekly review, I think is a fundamental practice
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.960]   that everyone needs to just maintain perspective
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.800]   on their week.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.880]   Something like a monthly review or an annual review
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.160]   where you're like zooming out to the big picture,
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.000]   long-term goals, values, your why, your mission,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.840]   things like that.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.720]   So that's part of it.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.840]   That also predates second brain stuff, right?
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.480]   That goes back 20, 30 years,
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.520]   the idea of a weekly review.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.080]   Most of the actual maintenance of let's say para
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.400]   in your second brain comes down
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.000]   to just how you manage projects.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.480]   To me, projects really are the first class citizen.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.560]   So when do you create that project folder
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.480]   that is gonna contain all the project-related material?
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.040]   When the project starts.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:35:59.920]   Then you execute it.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.040]   When does that get archived?
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.440]   When the project ends.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.280]   I have these kind of two moments in time.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.480]   What's so nice about projects
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.880]   is that they beginning and end, right?
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.960]   Areas, resources, and archives are kind of,
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.400]   it's fuzzy, their relationship to time.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.720]   Projects are discrete.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.960]   They're like sprints.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.480]   You start, you do, you end.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.200]   And therefore, I like to link
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.280]   and sort of schedule most of my maintenance activities
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.400]   to when projects begin and when they end.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.560]   Which by the way, also is how I justify the effort.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.220]   It's like the return on investment,
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.000]   your ability to justify going in
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.740]   and just reorganizing stuff,
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.760]   that's not a very good use of your time.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.840]   But if I'm going in specifically to manage a project,
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.520]   suddenly that time is very easily justifiable
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.080]   and is actually part of the project itself.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.960]   - If someone's hearing this and thinking,
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.080]   I have a horrible organization system,
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.440]   maybe it would make sense in an upfront way
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.000]   to kind of organize everything.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.780]   But on an ongoing basis, it's like,
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.280]   maybe don't get too crazy about organizing it.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.120]   But right now I'm like,
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.480]   gotta get these fantasy football notes.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.800]   I gotta get them to the archives, which doesn't exist yet.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.640]   - Anyone listening to this, you included,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.080]   I really do not recommend going in
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.000]   and sort of implementing para by trying to move
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.080]   hundreds or even thousands of files individually.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.680]   Just treat the past as the past.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.160]   Get every single thing, every single note,
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.640]   in Evernote or wherever you've kept things,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.320]   put it in one single folder called archive and today's date.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.560]   That is the past.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.680]   That is everything that happened before now.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.080]   And then start over, start with a clean slate
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.720]   with just the P.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.080]   Just create a folder for each of your active projects
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.120]   and be honest about what is active,
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.680]   not things you wish are active
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.400]   or that you're pretending are active.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.080]   Most people really don't have more
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.520]   than about five to 10 active projects.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.200]   So create a folder for each one of those.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.360]   Then from this point, only going forward,
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.600]   start putting the notes that you create into those folders.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.900]   - Where does email fit into this?
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.840]   I have like an email folder that's saved
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.480]   and it's like, oh, someone sent me this thing,
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.120]   it's super valuable.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.160]   Is your inbox part of your second brain
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.400]   or do you take emails out of your inbox
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.800]   and put them somewhere else?
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.680]   - Yeah, so the way I think about this
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.200]   is you have in your life several inboxes.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.160]   Email is kind of the most obvious one,
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.040]   but you have a notes inbox probably.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.000]   You have a task manager or to-do list
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.680]   where things get recorded.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.640]   You have even a mailbox, which is just another,
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:22.440]   like there's probably five to eight separate inboxes.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.120]   So when you think about a weekly review,
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.560]   often people think, oh, weekly review,
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.960]   I have to like review and evaluate my entire life.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.120]   What are my goals?
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.320]   What is my purpose in life?
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.520]   These like huge questions.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.000]   That's not what it's for.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.180]   I only do that like once a year, if that, right?
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.520]   That is really a lot of time and effort.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.120]   All a weekly review is for me
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.440]   is just going through my inboxes one at a time,
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.840]   deciding what can be deleted, what can be archived,
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   or just like put somewhere,
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.280]   and what needs to be taken action on.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.200]   That is all a weekly review is
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.220]   and how a weekly review takes no more
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.440]   than about 15 or 20 minutes every time.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.880]   - Let me ask you a very, very practical example.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.200]   I have a gift card that someone sent me
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.520]   for an online retailer
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.280]   that I'm not ready to buy anything from me now.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   Is that something that if you got that in your email,
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.240]   you would leave it as an email in some place
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.080]   or would save it somewhere else?
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.720]   Or what would you do with your own system,
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.200]   which may not be the best for me,
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.880]   but it's an example of something that I'm like,
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.920]   I feel like it's the kind of thing
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.600]   that always sits in someone's inbox
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.560]   and no one ever knows what to do with it.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.120]   - So great example.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.400]   The first question I always ask,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.980]   is this actionable or not actionable?
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.920]   So that is actually actionable.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.480]   When you think to the future time
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.120]   that you are actually acting on this,
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.180]   it is something you're doing.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.740]   You're going and spending the gift card on something.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.960]   What that tells me is
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.760]   there's always one of two places it can go,
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.760]   either Evernote or Things, which is my task manager.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.560]   So I know that's an action, so it's gonna go with Things.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.320]   And then the key feature of Things
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.400]   that is honestly, it's like the greatest,
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.760]   best kept secret in like the productivity world.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.480]   By far the most important feature of any task manager
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.080]   is a keyboard shortcut.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   So on Things, it's control option space bar.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.280]   It pops up a little window,
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.640]   like a tiny little window where I can write a task
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.480]   with a link to that specific email
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.160]   in the little comment section.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.420]   That little tiny thing is life changing
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:20.420]   because what I write in the task is spend $15 at Target,
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.880]   hit enter, that goes into my task manager.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.640]   And then I hit E on the keyboard,
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.200]   the email's archived forever.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.720]   I never need to organize it, sort it, do anything.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.040]   That is now something that I'm going to find again
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.000]   through my task manager, not through email.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.960]   - I'm not sure whether I like that system more
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.780]   or I'm more impressed that the email in my inbox
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.360]   is you've got a Target eGift card for $15.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.960]   I feel like we're on like a magic show
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.320]   where you're like, ah, I figured it out.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.560]   That's actually the gift card that I have sitting in my inbox.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.400]   - Really?
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.920]   - Yeah, it's literally a $15 Target gift card.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.760]   - No way.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.000]   - There was a promotion last night.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.400]   We forgot to buy diapers.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.480]   My wife was like, "Hey, we only have four diapers right now,"
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.640]   which is a problem.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.080]   And so fun hack for anyone listening,
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.160]   there's a product called Shipt, S-H-I-P-T,
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.120]   and you get a free membership as a Chase card holder.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.400]   I put in my Chase information.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.920]   I got a membership through December, 2024.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.420]   And with Shipt, you get free home delivery from Target.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.120]   And we ordered at like 5 p.m.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.520]   and we had diapers by 7 p.m.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.480]   And the delivery was free.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.680]   And it was buy two types of diapers.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.560]   So I just bought two orders of diapers
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.040]   and you get a free $15 gift card,
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.080]   which is why I have the $15 Target gift card.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.360]   So hack for free delivery.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.280]   - I think I have a $15 Target gift card
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.120]   around here somewhere.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.520]   That's why that came to mind.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.600]   - I don't know if you're buying diapers,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.700]   but that was mine. - Oh, I am, I am.
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.600]   - So little derailed there, but that is helpful.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.800]   I feel like my to-do process
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.080]   is probably the next upgrade.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.320]   Right now, I'm like a keep one note
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.840]   with a list of bullets for to-dos.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.440]   I haven't really gotten serious about that.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.880]   I know Things is an Apple only app,
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.120]   but I've heard great things.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.960]   Being a parent can be scary,
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.480]   whether it's watching your toddler
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.360]   jump on your new couch naked during potty training
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.600]   or the indescribable pain of stepping
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.480]   on tiny plastic dinosaurs in your bare feet,
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.300]   both of which happened to me recently.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.160]   Well, one thing that doesn't have to be scary
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.760]   is getting life insurance,
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.520]   especially when you do it with Fabric,
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.040]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.240]   Fabric by Gerber Life was designed by parents
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.240]   for parents to help you get a high quality,
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.360]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.800]   in less than 10 minutes.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.960]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.320]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.320]   and found Fabric to be highly competitive

[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.620]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.180]   With over a hundred classes
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.380]   from a range of world-class instructors

[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.860]   is way closer than you think.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.300]   When I signed up a few years ago,
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.860]   I jumped straight into an amazing cooking class
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.720]   by Thomas Keller that has totally leveled up my skills
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.660]   in the kitchen.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.460]   I also really enjoyed FBI hostage negotiator,
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:50.220]   Chris Voss' class on the art of negotiation.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.900]   And with every class I've taken,
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.880]   I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.060]   the instructors have and the quality of the experience.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.640]   And a Masterclass membership makes such a good gift

[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.020]   I wanna come back to one random macro question,
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.460]   which is there's this book called "Wayfinding,"
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.160]   where the author Maura O'Connor says
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.400]   that over-reliance on GPS, for example,
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.560]   has made us less able to navigate the world.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.260]   Do you have any concerns about over-reliance
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.660]   on a second brain and what that might do
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.260]   to our primary brain?
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.320]   Or are there times where it's like,
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.300]   you know what, this is something for not offloading?
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.860]   - I don't have concerns.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:03.700]   I don't have concerns.
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.860]   When I go back and read in ancient Greek times,
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:08.160]   pundits basically saying,
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.780]   "Oh, writing has corrupted the youth.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.420]   Their memory is now atrophied
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.400]   because this darned new invention of writing
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.460]   is going to lead to the downfall of society."
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.120]   I'm just like, this has been going on forever
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.200]   and will always go on.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.360]   The story of civilization is us offloading
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.200]   what used to require our bodies and minds to technology.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.040]   So I don't have concerns on that front.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.480]   But for the second part,
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.080]   part of what you're doing with a second brain
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:35.080]   is simply vacating your first brain of trivia,
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:39.600]   just mundane, mindless details
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.960]   that you are keeping track of.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.200]   Think about things you're supposed to buy
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.680]   at the grocery store today,
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.040]   things on your to-do list,
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.740]   details of a project you're working on.
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.020]   I think most of the time,
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.080]   most people's minds are just filled
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.360]   with stuff that can be offloaded,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.760]   that can be remembered far more precisely
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:58.320]   for far longer by machines than the human mind.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.700]   So I'm always thinking,
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.200]   if a job can be done by machines, it should be.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.700]   That intellect is free.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.360]   I have this vast intellect called software at my disposal.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.680]   Why not use it?
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.900]   Why not just give away that job?
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.660]   And I find over time that leaves space in my first brain
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.280]   for things that only the human mind can do.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.640]   That includes creativity, includes intuition,
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.880]   includes relationships, includes having novel experiences.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.680]   Like the average person is underwater.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.200]   The average person has no bandwidth.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.400]   So if you wanna make any change in your life whatsoever,
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.520]   where you have to start is by offloading something.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.420]   Because there's no space to even consider a new option
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.040]   until you offload that stuff.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.560]   (laughs)
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.120]   - It reminds me of in grade school,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.400]   you like memorize things.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.120]   Let's memorize this poem.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.680]   I still have a French poem that I could recite
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.080]   in like record speed because I had to memorize it.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.320]   Is there any benefit for that kind of memorized knowledge
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.560]   or does that find its way departing out of society
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.220]   as technology becomes more pervasive
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.960]   through educational practice?
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.920]   - There's ever less use cases for that.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.160]   Sometimes people bring up,
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.360]   oh, how about learning a language?
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.600]   I lived in Ukraine for two years in the Peace Corps,
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.080]   served in the Peace Corps.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.840]   And I studied Russian 'cause I was in the East.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.760]   And I did spaced repetition.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.880]   One of the most research-based,
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.320]   evidence-based ways to memorize something.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.280]   I had like several thousand Russian flashcards.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.360]   And I thought I was learning the language
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.180]   by just, you know, in a systematic way
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.040]   where you like review flashcards
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.360]   until you can memorize them
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.320]   and then you review them less and less.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.680]   Looking back, I wish I had spent zero time on that.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.960]   It would have been such a superior use of my time
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.240]   to just go do things, go out into the community,
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.560]   go grocery shopping, go to my students' dachas
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.900]   and just like hang out with their babushka.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.320]   Even in the case of language learning,
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.480]   which might be the prime example of first brain memory,
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.120]   doing, acting is superior, I think, to rote memorization.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.160]   The memorization of the words
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.720]   should better come as a side effect of just living,
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.000]   having interesting experiences
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.540]   rather than trying to cram things into your first brain.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.920]   - I guess that's a great tee up
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.880]   for what are the primary use cases
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.120]   for someone to be thinking about for their first brain?
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.800]   - So it's a funny thing because
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.240]   this book is in the self-improvement category or business,
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.400]   but you might think, "Oh, this is about optimizing."
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.080]   Like, you know, a word you use a lot,
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.120]   optimizing productivity efficiency,
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.200]   but I really see it as the exact opposite.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.060]   When I think about my life, my first brain, myself,
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.140]   I want to be ever less optimized over time.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.640]   I don't want to have any structure.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   I want to have less and less routine.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.600]   I want to just follow my curiosity and my passion
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.160]   completely spontaneously with no preconception,
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.520]   but I have responsibilities
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.400]   and things that I have to manage in the world.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.560]   So it's almost like I spend my time
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.640]   optimizing my second brain,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.760]   making it this well-oiled machine
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.440]   so that my first brain can be almost like a child.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.520]   I look at my two-year-old.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.200]   I'm like, I aspire to be like this kid.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.820]   He just goes after what he wants and what he loves
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.060]   like 100% of the time.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.700]   He's just so carefree, so spontaneous,
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.180]   so enlivened, so present.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.500]   That's the kind of stuff that I aspire to over time,
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.460]   and I can get away with it
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:18.260]   because I have my second brain over here.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.660]   - Well, that's a perfect segue.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.940]   I know you've talked about, you know,
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.060]   we each have two-year-olds.
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.620]   That really changes the way you operate and function.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.860]   As someone who plays in this space,
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.100]   even if you don't necessarily want to optimize your time
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.280]   in the way maybe I often think about doing,
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.620]   have you found ways or have you approached your day
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.640]   or how you get things done differently
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.980]   now that you probably, I'm guessing,
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.020]   have a big chunk of free time
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.320]   that you used to be able to spend working and doing things
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.920]   that you want to spend differently with your family?
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.200]   How has that changed?
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.840]   - Honestly, not much has changed
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.760]   because in a sense, I had already prepared for it.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:58.160]   When I look at what has changed for me having a kid
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.640]   is that the capabilities of this first brain,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.660]   I don't know how else to put it,
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.180]   but have just seriously deteriorated.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.500]   There's no other way to put it.
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.300]   Just my memory, my ability to focus,
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.920]   my attention span, my endurance, all of it.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.880]   I feel like in the past two years since having a kid
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.200]   is like less than half of what it was.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.440]   I hate to say that, but it's just true.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.780]   This is a common thing with smart people.
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.580]   It's sort of like their intellect,
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.100]   their mind is the hammer with which
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.300]   they approach everything like a nail.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.580]   Everything is about the intellect.
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.540]   They're just hammering in every problem
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:34.720]   in their life with the intellect,
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.980]   which is fine until the intellect fails.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.780]   I had this experience about 15 years ago
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:41.400]   with a chronic illness, the medication for which
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.500]   seriously hampered my short-term memory.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.880]   Looking back, that was almost like a gift.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.460]   I had like a window into what it would be like
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.780]   when my mind failed me, and I had that
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.460]   starting when I was 22, so I didn't have the option
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.060]   of relying too much on my intellect.
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:58.900]   I had to very early on find kind of an external system,
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.740]   and the result of that is I didn't have to change much
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.020]   once the kid arrived.
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.540]   I just relied ever more on these kind of external systems.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.060]   - Well, I know you have a second kid coming,
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.060]   and I have some unfortunate news for you
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.500]   that whatever deterioration I felt after child one
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.940]   now feels like nothing compared
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.020]   to the second child deterioration.
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.200]   You are very fortunate that you have put together
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.300]   your second brain to prepare for this,
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.040]   but if that comes and you find a way to do anything,
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.220]   let's do a follow-up.
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.220]   We're kind of running out of time,
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:30.020]   so I wanna jump on two or three quick things
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.380]   to just close us out.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.020]   While we're still on family,
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.460]   there was something you posted the other day.
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.700]   You shared an acknowledgement hack you use
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.940]   to avoid fights in your relationship,
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.100]   and I would love to just have you share that
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.300]   because I read it and I was like,
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.780]   I'm gonna start doing this.
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.700]   - Yeah, my wife and I have done a lot of programs
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.520]   and courses.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.280]   We're kind of course junkies.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.440]   We did a couples retreat, the first one ever,
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.300]   about maybe 18 months ago,
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:58.220]   and I'm just kind of amazed how many useful tools there are,
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.320]   which you would never hear about.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.920]   No one ever told me about these things.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.240]   Definitely not my parents, not my friends,
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:06.680]   haven't seen it modeled in culture, in TV, movies.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.280]   In fact, most of those sources
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.160]   were sort of negative influences,
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.040]   but we practice this at our couples retreat.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.400]   You can just go up to your spouse,
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.000]   look them in the eye and say,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.160]   I want to be acknowledged for doing the dishes
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.080]   last night when I was tired,
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.820]   and the other person can say,
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.300]   oh, look you in the eyes,
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.180]   I acknowledge you for doing the dishes last night,
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.440]   even when you were tired,
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.560]   and the commitment that it shows
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:35.460]   to the cleanliness, safety, and health of our family,
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.740]   and you just have a little moment,
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.180]   and that's it, and it's done,
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.060]   and as the receiver of that,
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.620]   the assumption is asking for it cheapens it.
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.460]   They're like, oh, they should just notice.
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.020]   It should spontaneously occur to them.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.620]   First of all, it won't,
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.680]   'cause they're doing their own things
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.180]   that then they want to be acknowledged for,
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.840]   but somehow asking for it does not in any way,
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.080]   in fact, it even lessens the experience,
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.520]   'cause you're simply asking for what you need
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.360]   and receiving it right then and there.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.280]   - Yeah, so I love that,
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.000]   and it's only been a few days since I've seen it,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.800]   so I don't have a ton of evidence yet of how it's worked,
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.400]   but I'm very excited to put that into use.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.480]   Any other things you've learned in those processes
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.580]   in your relationship that, you know,
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.360]   you said you wish that more were shared?
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.640]   - So much, so much.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.760]   The person who ran that couples retreat,
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.840]   his name is Joe Hudson.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.980]   He's become a great friend and mentor of mine,
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:23.960]   so much so that I helped him launch his own online course,
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.080]   because I took his program
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.120]   in this random house in San Francisco,
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.120]   and that was the only way to access it.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.460]   You had to like be in this one room in this one city,
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.820]   and I partnered with him to launch it to the world.
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:36.180]   It's called The Art of Accomplishment.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.820]   It's a cohort-based live course that you can sign up for,
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.260]   but I believe his work,
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.100]   which has to do with couples and relationships,
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.820]   but also emotional fluency and self-awareness
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.540]   is the category that I would put it in.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:51.020]   It's so rich, so subtle and complex.
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.420]   It's all about treating emotions
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:57.940]   as just important signals of information,
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.580]   as opportunities to learn and grow,
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:03.460]   rather than as these annoying sort of internal forces
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:05.320]   to avoid and suppress.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.420]   It's like the tweet-sized version of what he does.
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.540]   - I'll share that in the show notes.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:12.620]   Earlier, we talked about going back to the Greek times
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:14.820]   about productivity and knowledge management.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.380]   If we fast forward,
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:20.100]   what role do you think AI might end up playing
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.680]   in our second brains,
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.660]   and do you think it has a big impact on all this?
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:24.580]   - It does, yeah.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.140]   The way I see it is it's going to automate
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.380]   and substitute almost different links in the chain, right?
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.900]   So if you think of the creative process of code
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:35.820]   as like a supply chain, it's really a supply chain.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.980]   There's raw materials, which is like quotes,
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:41.260]   passages, images that you get from the outside world
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.700]   or the internal world,
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.060]   and then just like a manufacturing line,
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:49.140]   it gets refined, processed, enriched,
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.900]   manipulated in some way to become like a finished product.
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.120]   What AI is going to do,
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.340]   just as all kinds of technology has always done,
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.980]   is come in, get like one at a time
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.240]   different links in that chain
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.420]   that human minds previously had to do,
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:04.460]   and then just substitute it with machines.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:05.580]   And I think, honestly,
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.380]   that will be a boon to human creativity.
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:09.820]   It will allow us to move faster,
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:12.820]   spend more time on more value-added things,
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:17.340]   and ultimately just create better work faster.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.260]   I guess I'm a huge techno-optimist.
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.260]   (laughs)
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.460]   - I threw an episode I did last week
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:26.220]   into this AI chapter summarization tool.
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:27.500]   I uploaded the audio,
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.380]   and in a couple of minutes, it produced chapters.
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:31.820]   The summaries of those chapters
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.140]   was not something I want to publish,
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:39.020]   but it, in two minutes, took an hour-long conversation
[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.620]   and gave me the highlights
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.700]   of the key moments of the conversation,
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:44.040]   and it blew my mind.
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:44.880]   (laughs)
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.860]   It was called assembly.ai, I think.
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.780]   And I was just like, "This is crazy."
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.780]   Now, it's not ready to be published,
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.900]   but if I were sitting here trying to think...
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:53.740]   Let's take example.
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:54.560]   If I, at the end of the year,
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:57.540]   I want to do top lessons from 2022,
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:00.980]   I could, in an hour, run 52 episodes through,
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:03.860]   get the highlights of all the summaries of all of them,
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.260]   and start to pull things together.
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:06.900]   So I'm very optimistic,
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:10.520]   especially as it comes to distilling a lot of content
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:13.620]   that you have into even quicker things,
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.940]   and who knows where it goes from there.
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:17.300]   - Incredible. I love that.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.920]   Yeah, why should humans spend their time creating chapters?
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.340]   Like, let's give these jobs to machines, please.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.180]   (laughs)
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.740]   - So the last thing, I should have prepared you,
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:27.860]   so you're gonna be on the spot.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.500]   I always like to ask people,
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:32.140]   is there a city that you're really familiar with
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:33.700]   that, if anyone listening,
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:36.980]   is gonna adventure to sometime in the next few years,
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.320]   where you have some recommendations
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.540]   of either a place to eat, a thing to do,
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:43.380]   favorite place to grab a drink that they can check out?
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.220]   - I do, yeah.
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.540]   It's become super trendy now about Mexico City.
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.580]   My wife and I lived there all of 2019,
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.940]   just before the pandemic.
[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:51.100]   We thought it was popular then.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:53.060]   Now, there was just a New York Times article
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.380]   how Americans are overrunning Mexico City.
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.620]   It is just a gem.
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:59.820]   The way I describe it is it's the best of Latin America,
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:02.380]   North America, and Europe, all in one city.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.540]   And in terms of where to go,
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:05.060]   so in a year there,
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.720]   we tried a stupid number of restaurants.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.380]   Our favorite one, and I almost hesitate to give this away,
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:13.300]   because I feel like a semi-undiscovered secret.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.980]   It's actually a hotel restaurant.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.300]   It's the restaurant in the Hotel Carlotta,
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.140]   which is up there.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:18.960]   I forget which neighborhood,
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.340]   but if you just Google Hotel Carlotta,
[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:24.500]   there is a chef there that we actually got to know
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.100]   who makes food that I just haven't experienced
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:27.940]   anywhere else.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:30.620]   It's our number one recommendation for Mexico City.
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:31.440]   - I love it.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.780]   Maybe I'll leave it out of the show notes.
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:33.620]   You can only get it
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.220]   if you make it to the end of the episode.
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.660]   And now I'm ready to take another trip to Mexico City
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.500]   and check it out.
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.280]   Tiago, thank you so much for being here.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.540]   I thought I was gonna come in and leave with a lot of work.
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.940]   Now I have a simple job of throwing everything
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:48.780]   in the archive and a work of just creating a few projects
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:49.980]   and kind of starting anew.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:53.740]   So I feel much less overwhelmed about something
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:56.040]   that I'm very excited to make practice in my life.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.380]   So thank you so much for being here
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.380]   and sharing everything with all the listeners.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.200]   - It's my pleasure.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.040]   Thank you so much.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:03.240]   It was a great conversation, great questions.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.260]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.020]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.140]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.900]   for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,

[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:18.460]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,

[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:31.060]   (electronic beeping)
[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:34.140]   (electronic buzzing)
