[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.300]   He died forgiving those who killed him, and he drew into eternal life a hellbound criminal.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.840]   He never was off mission, even in the most disastrous of circumstances in his life.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.200]   He died as he lived, completely trusting the faithfulness of his Father.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.140]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.620]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:01:00.600]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:16.660]   And we from the heart honor the Lord with our repentance, confession, faith and trust, and obedience as we partake.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:24.340]   But before we do that, I want to take a look at the cross, maybe from a different perspective.
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.640]   So if you want to look in your Bible, it's 1 Peter 2.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:39.160]   1 Peter 2, and I'll just make a few remarks with regard to this passage.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:47.780]   1 Peter 2, of course, 1 Peter is written to believers who are scattered in a hostile world,
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.800]   and they are, in the very outset of this epistle, identified as aliens in the world.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.540]   They're suffering insults and persecution.
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.940]   And Peter writes this to encourage them.
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.040]   In chapter 2, we'll look at verse 20: "What credit is there if when you sin and are harshly
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.800]   treated you endure it with patience?
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:26.620]   But if when you do what is right and suffer for it, you patiently endure it, this finds
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.620]   grace with God."
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:37.560]   "For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.820]   you an example for you to follow in His steps, who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.120]   in His mouth.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.380]   And while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.820]   threats but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously.
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.700]   And He did not revile in return, while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.700]   Himself to Him who judges righteously.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:08.380]   And He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:16.060]   live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed."
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.380]   Marvelous portion of Scripture, one that is one of my very favorites.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.780]   Of course, verse 24 is the central truth of the gospel.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.860]   "That He bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.400]   to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed."
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.620]   That is the central truth of the gospel, the substitutionary, vicarious, atoning death
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.600]   of Christ, by which our sins were imputed to Him, and in return by faith in Him, His
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.800]   righteousness is imputed to us.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.660]   We acknowledge Christ as our Savior, our Redeemer, the sacrifice for sin.
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:04.640]   The Lamb of God, providing in His death redemption, ransom, deliverance, justification, adoption
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.860]   for all who believe.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.060]   Through His death, the one sacrificial death that satisfied divine justice, the once for
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.840]   all death of Christ that provided eternal salvation to all who believe and confess Jesus
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.940]   as Lord and Savior.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.540]   But there's something more in the death of Christ.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:33.060]   Beyond the substitutionary atonement that He provided, which of course is the most monumental
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.160]   of all features in His death.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.840]   But there is something more.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.900]   You might say, "Well, is that even possible?"
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.780]   The answer is yes.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.540]   Look at verse 21.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.460]   "For you have been called for this purpose," what purpose?
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.420]   "To suffer for doing right," as in verse 24.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:06.060]   Verse 20, "to suffer patiently with endurance, and thereby in such enduring righteous suffering
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.660]   find grace with God."
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.520]   You've been called to suffer in this world.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.900]   Since Christ also suffered for you, you have the privilege of now suffering for Him.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.300]   As Paul said, "I bear in my body the marks of Christ."
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.860]   You suffer for His name's sake.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:38.680]   And in His dying, verse 21, He left you an example for you to follow in His steps in
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.680]   your suffering.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.500]   It is right, of course, to look at the cross as the vicarious substitutionary atoning death
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:55.180]   of Christ, the once for all death for sin in which He purchased redemption for all.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:03.460]   For all who would believe through all of human history, we understand the cross to be the
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.460]   very validation of God's salvation plan.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.940]   But we're told here that there was something else going on on the cross.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:25.060]   Jesus who suffered for us was leaving us an example for how we should suffer.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.840]   Obviously, we can't suffer for our own sins, so this is not some kind of vicarious suffering
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.100]   which purchases redemption for us or anyone else.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:45.440]   But clearly, since we are in the world suffering for Christ's sake, suffering for righteousness,
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:53.540]   patiently enduring it, which finds grace with God, we need to know how to deal with that
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.940]   suffering.
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.340]   "Follow Me."
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:05.720]   And the apostle Paul said, "Follow Me as I follow Christ."
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.220]   Peter's not talking here about his living.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.360]   Yes, we follow Him in His living.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.020]   We endeavor to walk as He walked.
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:24.820]   Peter is saying in His dying He is an example, a hupagramon , a copy, something
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:36.560]   that we set down and trace over to make as exact a replica as possible.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:44.240]   He gave us a pattern for how to face unjust suffering.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:51.400]   In His dying, He gave us a pattern for living in a hostile world.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.700]   He taught us how to face injustice.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:02.340]   Injustice, rejection, persecution.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.780]   He is the sinless example.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:14.120]   In verse 22 we read, "Who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth."
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.440]   In His suffering, He was sinless.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.640]   He was sinless in every aspect of His life.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.580]   But the most severe tests, obviously, He was sinless.
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.160]   And the most severe test that we see in His life as a man would be the same
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:36.460]   as the most severe tests in our lives, and that would be the test that relentless,
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:44.020]   undeserved, brutal suffering puts us through.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:52.280]   But in His suffering, which from a human standpoint was unjust, undeserved, He was
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.460]   reviled and scorned and blasphemed and mocked.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:00.640]   And mocked and spit on and beaten and whipped and you know the rest.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.660]   And in all of that, He is an example for us of how to handle suffering because He never
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.220]   committed a sin.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:16.740]   A sin like questioning God, doubting God, debating with God.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.180]   Nor was there any deceit found in His mouth.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:24.340]   Nothing came out of His mouth that indicated an evil heart.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.300]   He never did anything unholy.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:41.580]   He never said anything unholy, even in the worst possible conditions.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:48.980]   And He became our example, so that when we are persecuted for righteousness' sake, we
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.620]   follow Him.
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.060]   We do nothing sinful.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.220]   We say nothing sinful.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:10:06.580]   Verse 23 says, "And while being reviled, He did not revile in return."
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:16.500]   The word "revile" means to abuse, vile speech cast at someone.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:22.160]   It's a present passive participle which means it was happening over and over and over and
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.200]   over and over and over.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:30.940]   "And while being reviled, He did not revile in return.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:43.500]   And while suffering in this reviling circumstance, He uttered no threats."
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.780]   He didn't strike back.
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.820]   And again, the verb is a verb of continuous action.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.160]   It came at Him over and over and over.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.460]   You know the story.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.180]   We read you a portion of it.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:01.200]   "He was mistreated long before that and frequently through His life and ministry.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.620]   And in His trial and all the events leading up to the final crucifixion, He was abused
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.160]   and maligned.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:20.260]   He never retaliated, never gave abuse for abuse, never gave threats for threats given
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.180]   to Him."
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.180]   That's the word.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.180]   "He was mistreated."
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.180]   That's the word.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.180]   That's the negative.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.180]   The positive is at the end of verse 23.
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:33.760]   "But kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously."
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:40.080]   The hardest thing for us in life, I think, is to endure unjust suffering.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   Back at the beginning of verse 20, we're told by Peter that - and it's obvious - if
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.940]   you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience, you don't get any credit
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.060]   for that.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.180]   You deserve that.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:59.120]   But we know when we're guilty, and we know when what's happening to us is the chastening
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.520]   of the Lord.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:12.120]   But when we are suffering for righteousness, there's a tendency to want to fight back,
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.440]   but Jesus becomes our example.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:21.000]   He just kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.160]   The verb means to turn Himself over.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.500]   He just kept saying, "I'm going to turn myself over to Him who judges righteously."
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.500]   He just kept saying, "I'm going to turn myself over to Him who judges righteously."
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.500]   He just kept saying, "I'm going to turn myself over to Him who judges righteously."
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.500]   He just kept saying, "I'm going to turn myself over to Him who judges righteously."
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.500]   He just kept saying, "I'm going to turn myself over to Him who judges righteously."
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:44.500]   He just kept saying, "I'm going to turn myself over to Him who judges righteously."
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.500]   He just kept saying, "I'm going to turn myself over to Him who judges righteously."
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.500]   He just kept saying, "I'm going to turn myself over to Him who judges righteously."
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.500]   He just kept saying, "I'm going to turn myself over to Him who judges righteously."
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.460]   He just kept saying, "I'm going to turn myself over to Him who judges righteously."
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.580]   And it's revealed in His seven last sayings on the cross.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:02.120]   In His dying, He shows what it is to entrust yourself to God.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:15.420]   In His unjust treatment, He shows us an example of one who never gave back abuse, never threatened,
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.840]   but committed himself to God.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.840]   Let me just review them.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.480]   I read them earlier.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:26.360]   In His dying, He shows us really how to live.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.080]   First of all, the first thing He said on the cross, Luke 23:34, "Father, forgive them,
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.020]   for they do not know what they are doing."
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.040]   This is the first principle you see in an example.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   He died seeking forgiveness for the very people who were harming Him.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.460]   This is an example of how we are to respond to those who treat us.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:58.800]   He didn't treat us with revulsion and abuse when we don't deserve it.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.460]   He knew they were ignorant.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.200]   He knew they didn't understand the reality of their monstrous sin.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.760]   He knew they didn't know who He was.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.180]   They didn't know they were murdering the Prince of life, the Creator and Savior.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.440]   And He knew they needed forgiveness, and that's what He prayed for.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:28.740]   The forgiveness He prayed for was actually made possible by the very suffering He was
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:35.640]   undergoing, not at the hands of men, but at the hands of God.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.960]   He is the perfect pattern of forgiveness, because He can forgive the people who are
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:47.940]   doing the most dastardly thing that's ever been done in the history of the world.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.940]   He's an example of how you respond to the people who are doing the most dastardly thing
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.420]   that's ever been done in the history of the world.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:15:01.800]   He's an example of how you respond to being treated with fierce evil when you don't deserve
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.340]   it.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:10.420]   You seek God's forgiveness for the ones who are doing it to you.
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:17.040]   The second thing He said on the cross is in Luke 23:43: "Truly I say to you, today you
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.400]   shall be with Me in paradise."
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.860]   It's amazing.
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:26.780]   With all that is going on and all that He is experiencing, and He's experiencing things
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:33.480]   on a human level, and He's experiencing even greater things on the divine level, He is
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:40.780]   in a position He's never been in, and He is an eternal person.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:46.780]   This is horror inconceivable to Him.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.360]   But He turns to a thief beside Him and says, "Truly I say to you, today you shall be with
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   Me in paradise."
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.360]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.080]   He's not going to be a thief.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:18:00.340]   He demonstrates in His dying an example of expressing selfless love.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.360]   If ever there was a moment when He might have been preoccupied with His own situation, when
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:13.300]   He would have had a right to call on somebody to offer comfort for Him, standing near the
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.100]   cross He sees Mary.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.840]   Her heart is now pierced.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.880]   She's in pain.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:29.360]   She's seeing the son she loved nailed to a cross.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:35.200]   She's experiencing weakness, silence, confusion.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.300]   Joseph is dead, far as we know.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.000]   Crowds are jostling.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.360]   Soldiers are gambling.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.080]   Jesus is bleeding and dying.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.320]   She has no husband.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.560]   She has no son.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:56.380]   And the rest of her children didn't believe in Jesus, according to John 7:5.
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.960]   They didn't until after the resurrection.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.440]   So what's going to happen to her?
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:09.180]   She's a widow, no one to care for her.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:14.660]   And then there's John, that most intimate of all disciples, that most tender disciple,
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.800]   who is crushed and fearful and massively disillusioned.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:26.080]   And Jesus knows the pain of Mary, and He knows the pain of John.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:33.480]   And unconcerned with His own pain and His own agony, He puts the two of them together
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:41.800]   and says, "John, take care of Mary.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.280]   Mary, you have a new son, John."
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:56.560]   This is the selflessness of Christ, which is an example to us in the direst circumstance.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.880]   What are you preoccupied with?
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.680]   You should be seeking the forgiveness of the people who are harming you.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.700]   You should stay on mission and never lose sight of the fact that you're here to lead
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.220]   people to salvation.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.520]   And you should be completely absorbed in the needs of others, no matter how difficult your
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.160]   life might appear.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.280]   All right.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.160]   Let's go.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   Let's go.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.760]   But He's an example in His fourth words as well.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:27.800]   The fourth thing from the cross is Matthew 27:46: "My God, My God, why have You forsaken
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   Me?"
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.120]   What does that show?
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:40.160]   I think it tells us this, that He died understanding the horror of sin.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.960]   He died understanding the horror of sin.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.040]   He knew what it did.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.040]   Whatever the mystery of that separation is, He knew what it did.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.660]   The question is, and it's unfathomable to me, He felt the horrors of sin.
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:58.180]   In Matthew 26, He feels the judgment coming.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:03.800]   In the garden He sweats, as it were, great drops of blood.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:10.080]   The apostle Paul said He became a curse.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.520]   And the fierceness of His hatred of sin caused Him to say to the Father, "If there's any
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.040]   way to take this cup and give it to Me, I will do it."
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   He said, "If there's any way to take this cup and remove it, do that.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.040]   Nevertheless, Your will, not Mine."
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.900]   He's a perfect example of forgiving those who persecute Him.
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:33.980]   He's a perfect example of evangelizing those even in the most difficult circumstance.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:39.820]   He's the perfect example of loving others when you're suffering more than they are.
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:45.920]   He's the perfect example of resisting sin.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:58.120]   We are more susceptible to sinning when we are under the assault and attack of sin.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.420]   He shows His hatred of sin.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.920]   The fifth thing He said is in John 19:28.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.720]   He said, "I thirst."
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.640]   What does that tell us?
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.180]   That He died experiencing suffering so He could sympathize.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.800]   He died experiencing suffering, human suffering.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   He was thirsty.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   He knew what it was to be thirsty, hungry, sleepless, weary, weak, tempted.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:30.820]   In fact, He was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.820]   What was the point of that?
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:38.760]   So that He might be a merciful and faithful high priest who could come to us in our suffering
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:45.680]   and offer us comfort, because He had been there.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:55.680]   And the sixth thing He said from the cross, John 19:30, "It is finished."
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.140]   I love this.
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:03.800]   He gives us an example of one, very important, who died having completed the work God gave
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.580]   Him to do.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:14.560]   He died having completed the work God gave Him to do.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.560]   He appeared.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:28.020]   John 19:35 says, "To take away sin by the sacrifice of Himself, by paying the debt."
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.020]   He did that.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.300]   What kind of an example is He?
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:38.940]   He's an example in His dying of how to live, forgiving those who hate you and persecute
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:45.440]   you for righteousness' sake, evangelizing no matter how hard the circumstances, selflessly
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.620]   loving others and making sure their needs are met even though yours are more severe,
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:24:01.200]   resisting sins, sympathizing, and finishing the work that God gave you to do.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:07.760]   And finally, the capstone, the last thing He said on the cross is in Luke 23:46.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.320]   He said, "Father, into Your hands I commit my spirit."
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.620]   All of this comes together at this point.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.320]   This is what Peter was saying.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:24.060]   He died as he lived, completely trusting the faithfulness of his Father.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.900]   That's what Peter says, doesn't he, at the end of verse 23?
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:35.920]   He kept entrusting himself to Him who judges righteously.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   He trusted God.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.180]   This is the culmination of everything.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:45.200]   He could do all the rest because he trusted God.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.760]   He was a faithful servant of God who promised to deliver Him.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.020]   He knew that He would die.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.460]   He knew that He would be buried.
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.280]   He knew that He would rise in three days.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.880]   He knew that He would ascend to the right hand of the Father.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:07.800]   This is all beautifully summed up in Hebrews 12.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:15.080]   Listen to verses 1 to 3: "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:20.320]   us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us,
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.580]   and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us."
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.640]   This is the writer of Hebrews calling us to the same kind of endurance in a hostile world,
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.480]   fixing our eyes on Jesus.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.900]   He's our example, the author and perfecter of faith.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:44.960]   And here's what I want you to hear: "Who for the joy set before Him endured the cross,
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.600]   despising the shame?"
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.240]   Why did He endure all that?
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.720]   Why did He handle the suffering the way He did?
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.240]   Because He knew that on the other side was joy.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.240]   How did He know that?
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.400]   Because that was the promise of the Father, and He trusted the Father.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:08.320]   We are to live as He died: forgiving, evangelizing, loving, resisting sin, sympathizing, finishing,
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:14.840]   and in all of it, trusting God in the moments of hell's most dreadful hour.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.500]   The promise of God was a promise of eternal joy.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.200]   He was a promise of eternal joy, of eternal peace, of eternal joy, and of eternal joy.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   He was a promise of eternal joy.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.200]   He was a promise of eternal life.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   He was a promise of eternal life.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   He was a promise of eternal life.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   He was a promise of eternal life.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.200]   Why did He endure all that?
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   Because He knew that the most vicious assaults and Satan's most dangerous efforts, because
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.200]   set before us by the promise of God, is eternal joy, as it was for Him.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:39.880]   Now, Father, we thank You for the treasure of the truth that grips our minds and hearts
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.720]   and allows us to face life even in its most difficult experiences.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.480]   We thank You for the precious faith that we have in the Lord, and we thank You for all
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:54.020]   the richness that converged on us this hour, and the sweet fellowship of those around us
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:27:01.300]   who are of like precious faith and who love the Lord that we love.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:06.040]   And we've offered to You our humble worship, trusting that it's acceptable to You, because
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.660]   we come in the name and in the merits of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.600]   In His name we pray, and everyone said, "Amen."
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:12.980]   Amen.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:18.140]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:23.560]   Isn't it amazing how much the Scripture comes alive the more we study it, the more we understand
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.320]   what it means by what it says?
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:32.300]   Grace To You exists for one purpose: to unleash God's truth one verse at a time.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.260]   For over 45 years, John MacArthur has been doing just that.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:41.200]   The fruit of that labor, in part, is found at the resources available at Grace To You.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.860]   Whether through the verse-by-verse information that you're reading, or through the Bible
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:47.780]   information found in the Study Bible, the New Testament commentaries, or the thousands
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:54.720]   of messages available to download or stream free of charge, we want to be a valued resource
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.440]   as you seek to understand God's Word.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:03.580]   To take advantage of the resources available, simply visit our website at gty.org or give
