[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.960]   Today, our special guest is Fraser Rice.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.520]   Fraser is the Northwest Regional Director for Pendleton Square

[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.840]   Fraser has decades of experience working
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.400]   with high net worth and ultra high net worth families.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.520]   We'll be talking about his experiences,
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.960]   and he'll be providing us with a lot of great ideas
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.960]   we can all use at every level of wealth.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.600]   With no further ado, let me introduce Fraser Rice.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.080]   Welcome to the Bogle Heads, Fraser.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.120]   Rick, thank you for having me on.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.600]   I was looking at the podcast before I came on,
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.280]   and I saw that you had Morgan Housel, Cliff Asness,
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.000]   and Roger Lowenstein on before me.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.560]   And to be part of that kind of a group of people is really cool.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160]   I'm honored to be here.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.440]   Well, I've been a follower of yours a long time,
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.640]   because you write some really interesting blogs,
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.880]   and you wrote a book called Wealth Actually,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.600]   Intelligent Decision Making for the 1%.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.960]   And it's almost, you're sticking your neck out there,
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.920]   and you're saying, look, I advise to be elite.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.000]   I advise to the 1%.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.880]   And that might turn some people the wrong way,
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.120]   but for me, it intrigued me.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.440]   One, that you say you do it.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.120]   And number two, I want to have a conversation with you
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.280]   about this, because there might be some really good ideas
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.440]   that you're doing with your ultra high net worth clients
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.240]   that could help everyone.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.080]   It's funny you say that,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.120]   because when I put the book together,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.880]   and the people who helped me publish it were saying,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.000]   you've got to market this,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.400]   and one way to be good at marketing is to find your niche.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.000]   And the niche for me in my practice
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.680]   was in that sort of 1% world,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.040]   and we'll talk about what that means shortly.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.120]   But in terms of selling books,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.440]   that was probably a big mistake,
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.680]   because a lot of people said,
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.760]   geez, this is for the 1%, only it doesn't apply to me.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.000]   And as I got through writing it,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.040]   there were a lot of lessons that apply to people
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.360]   in all different strata.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.400]   And if I had it to do over again,
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.200]   I might sort of couch it as something a little bit more broad
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.760]   from a book selling perspective.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.080]   But the book itself, it's got some good lessons,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.680]   I think, for people of all stripes.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.960]   - And we'll get to the book in a minute,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.400]   and everything you've wrote in there.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.720]   But before we do that, let's hear about your background.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.440]   How did you get to become an advisor to the ultra wealthy?
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.920]   - Well, it's a varied background.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.600]   And like most people,
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.200]   they go through two or three iterations of things
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.480]   before they get to where they are.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.160]   I started out, I worked in politics after college.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.280]   I worked for New York State
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.000]   Department of Economic Development.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.600]   And my job was to sort of go around the state
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.360]   and to try to help businesses either located in New York
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.600]   or otherwise stay here,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.320]   which is difficult given our business climate.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.440]   I didn't want to be a civil servant my whole life.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.280]   So I did what other law souls do, and I went to law school,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.120]   went down to Emory in Atlanta.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.920]   And I had a lot of,
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.120]   aside from the really good legal education there,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.920]   I had a lot of really cool experiences.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.200]   I worked for the SEC and for a music lawyer down there.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.840]   So I got some work in the entertainment space.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.160]   Then I worked for the House Banking Committee
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.160]   my second summer,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.680]   and then the Federal Reserve in my third year.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.760]   So I had kind of an interesting pastiche
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.880]   of legal experiences.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.560]   My third year in law school down there,
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.320]   and I said I liked Atlanta, nice people.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.880]   The Fed was sort of interesting work,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.840]   half corporate council work, half regulatory.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.760]   And that was interesting.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.560]   But I decided pretty early on
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.320]   that practicing law wasn't what I wanted to do.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.560]   I made it back up to New York.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.200]   I passed the bar.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.080]   And I got started.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.720]   I practiced law with my uncle's firm for a couple of years,
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.960]   which entailed some lobbying
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.280]   and securities regulation and banking law,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.640]   which sort of befitted the last two experiences I had.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.360]   But in the meantime, I wanted to do something else.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.560]   And I ran into a family friend
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.960]   who started Wilmington Trust's office in New York,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.840]   basically on the back of his Rolodex.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   And he liked the idea of lawyers as issue spotters.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.800]   And at the same time, I hadn't been practicing so long
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.160]   that my answer to everything was no or it depends.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.560]   So he hired me.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.040]   And I worked for a managing director
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.440]   for about four or five years.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.920]   She left and moved on.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.320]   And then I was on my own for almost 16 years.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.520]   I took care of the ones I had
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.880]   and went out and found new ones.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.600]   And when you work for a trust company,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.240]   you get very heavily involved,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.000]   certainly in the investments,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.720]   certainly on the liability side of things,
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.920]   lending and that.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.840]   But I really got into the trust and the state side of it.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.520]   About year 14 into my 16 years at Wilmington,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.680]   I started a podcast,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.880]   which had been called "Fraser Rice's Podcast"
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.080]   because I'm not good with titles.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.480]   But then I also, I felt like I had a book in me.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.880]   I wrote "Wealth Actually,"
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.960]   which tried to congeal a lot of the lessons
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.320]   that I'd learned within my experience
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.320]   with Wilmington and beyond.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.920]   And I ended up publishing that.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.160]   I had to leave Wilmington to do that.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.120]   So I did, published my book,
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.160]   publicized that for a little while.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.000]   I joined up with a smaller RIA
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.360]   and worked for them for about a year
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.640]   doing strategic work for some of their bigger clients.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.440]   And then the part that I'm really excited about
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.440]   is I moved to a trust company called Pendleton Square,
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.560]   trust company out of Tennessee.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.040]   And it aligns really well with my way of thinking on things.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.640]   And a lot of it has to do with independence.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.240]   A lot of it has to do with using jurisdictions for planning.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.160]   And there are lots of good reasons to do that,
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.440]   not least of which tax,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.560]   but there are other good estate planning reasons to do it.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.880]   And it really gets me involved with a broader subset
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.080]   of the financial services community.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.320]   I get to work with the investment advisors
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.440]   and it can be anywhere from Morgan Stanley or UBS
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.880]   or Goldman Sachs or whomever to the high-end RIAs,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.840]   to broker dealers, to folks who are managing money.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.360]   But then I also get to work with the families themselves.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.080]   And so many times I butt up against family offices
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.160]   and multifamily offices,
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.920]   people who really need a lot of structure
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.240]   around their wealth for a variety of different reasons.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.440]   So that's where I am right now.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.600]   And sort of gutting out COVID here in Manhattan,
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.480]   but doing a lot of good stuff.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.040]   - That's quite a varied background
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.840]   and certainly have the experience to help us out here today
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.680]   in understanding trusts and understanding taxes
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.200]   and investing and asset protection.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.640]   And a lot of things that we don't normally talk about
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.000]   on an investing podcast,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.040]   but I think it's extremely important
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.400]   to understand how these things work.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.680]   But before we dig into all the nitty gritty
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.680]   of the trust work that you do for high net worth clients,
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.280]   one of the Bogleheads asked a question.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.200]   He would like this podcast to start with,
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.680]   what is a ultra high net worth,
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.680]   a high net worth 1% or how do you define this marketplace?
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.080]   - Sure.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.360]   And I've gone in this whole thing
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.160]   about how I fled the practice of law
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.280]   and I'm going to come back to the answer, it depends.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.040]   But I try to tackle this a little bit in my book
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.840]   and there are a few ways to think about it.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.000]   Sort of 1% from a current income perspective,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.560]   let's call it sort of wage income,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.280]   I think is probably in the,
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.240]   depending on where you live in the United States,
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.480]   let's call it the 300,000 to 700,000 bandwidth.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.160]   From an asset perspective,
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.600]   meaning the assets that you have in a net worth statement,
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.840]   I think it's probably more,
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.760]   I think maybe the two and a half or 3 million range.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.360]   The banks, when they market segment to,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.040]   let's call it the affluent, the high net worth
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.560]   and the ultra high net worth,
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.200]   I think in general, zero to 3 million is in the affluent,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.720]   three to 10 million is in the high net worth,
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.760]   meaning you have a lot of assets
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.240]   and you have theoretically more money
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.480]   than you can spend before you die.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.000]   And then there's what I would call
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   the really high net worth,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.320]   which is maybe 10 million to 50 million,
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.520]   where, and certainly currently,
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.040]   you have significant estate planning issues
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.160]   and definitely more money than you should be able to spend.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.400]   Yet at the same time,
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.040]   you are far away from what I would describe
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.600]   as institutional advice.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.320]   And then once you get over 50 million,
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.760]   I think most people would categorize that
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.680]   as ultra high net worth,
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.960]   where especially on the investment advice side,
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.800]   you're out of the, I'll put in quotes,
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.200]   retail high net worth offerings
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.160]   and much more into the institutional offerings
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.640]   and able to negotiate your terms of engagement
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.400]   with the institutions, things like that.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.440]   And I'll add one more sort of slice to that,
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.880]   which is the idea of the family office
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.200]   or the multifamily office,
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.120]   where your affairs are so complicated or so specific
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.680]   that you need your own staff
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.120]   that truly understands what you're up to.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.600]   People have their own family offices.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.080]   They make sense from a dollar perspective
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.600]   in terms of maintenance and upkeep of them,
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.720]   certainly over $100 million,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.840]   but probably more like over 500 million or a billion dollars
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.800]   when you're hiring staff and doing that type of thing.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.120]   I would add one other thought process here,
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.200]   and I'm going to steal from two colleagues.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.360]   And I can't call Scott Galloway a colleague.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.960]   I've never met him, but I've read his books and I like them.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.800]   He defines rich as when your burn rate
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.080]   is less than the passive income that you generate.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.080]   And I really like that,
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.120]   because that means when you go to bed at night,
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.320]   your assets are generating so much
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.640]   that it covers your costs
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.640]   and you don't have to really do anything.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.240]   Another way of thinking about that
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.920]   is a definition from a friend of mine, Brian Portnoy,
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.960]   who in his book, "Geometry of Wealth,"
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.080]   described it as funded contentment.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.560]   Now, that may be away from the equation
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.600]   that Scott Galloway put out that said that the burn rate
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.040]   has to be lower than the passive income that you generate.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.880]   But in Brian's case, I think he means to say
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.960]   that if you've got a lifestyle that you've set upon
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.080]   and you have the assets and income necessary to fund it
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.440]   without a whole lot of worry and risk due to volatility
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.560]   and things like that, that that's interesting.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.120]   In my book, I try to define it.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.360]   Am I rich deals with various types of flavor
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.880]   of those descriptions that we talked about.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.720]   But I think just to throw numbers out at it,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.320]   if you have $20 million and you're earning 4% off of that,
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.840]   however you find a way to do it,
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.400]   and that's $800,000, I think that's rich for most people.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.920]   I think that covers the lion's share
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.560]   of a lot of different spending.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.320]   Now, obviously, there's some people in New York City
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.000]   for whom $800,000 is gonna be a couple of months rent
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.600]   out in the Hamptons, and that doesn't quite apply.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.640]   But that 20 million figure, I think,
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.960]   really puts you in the category of rich.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.040]   - Interesting that the first thing you talked about
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   was wages, where a lot of people associate wages
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.040]   and your income with being rich.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.080]   And I think the government statistics generally break out
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.280]   their poverty levels based on income.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.600]   You could go back to your Fed days
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.840]   and correct me if I'm wrong, but I find this ironic
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.080]   because a lot of the clients I work with are rich,
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.360]   according to your numbers.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.000]   And yet, if you look at their income,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.220]   they're at the poverty level.
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.040]   They get listed on government statistics
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.480]   as being in the poverty level.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.200]   And ironically, they qualify
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.680]   for ACA healthcare tax credits, subsidies,
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.480]   their energy paid for at their home in the wintertime
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.120]   and such, only because the government uses just income
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.760]   as a measure for who's wealthy and who's not.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.560]   And in reality, a lot of these folks
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.160]   who are getting healthcare subsidies
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.720]   and getting other subsidies are, in fact, multimillionaires.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.160]   But that's just not the way those entities measure wealth.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   So things can be skewed pretty quickly.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.320]   - Well, and it goes back to really,
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.640]   how do you analyze wealth?
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.460]   And if you go back to sort of accounting features,
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.560]   it's the difference between a cashflow statement
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.680]   and an asset and liability statement.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   And taken to one extreme,
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.460]   if you have a $10 million house but no income,
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.760]   you are quote-unquote wealthy in one respect,
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.120]   but poor in another, as you just described.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.720]   Whereas the investment banker who makes $5 million a year
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.100]   over the course of, let's call it a 25-year career,
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:26.100]   but forgets to save, they're wealthy at one moment in time,
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.160]   but then poor once they get into the retirement component.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.800]   And I think that's what we as advisors have to do,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   especially at the high end,
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.400]   is try to really educate people
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.680]   that wealth really involves taking a look
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.240]   at both of those kinds of features
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.360]   and that you don't forget one at the expense of the other.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.540]   - And the tax code itself is regressive.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.480]   If you are saying that the rich need to pay
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.440]   their fair share of taxes,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.960]   well, they're not talking about wealth.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.900]   They're talking about income.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.280]   And there's a big difference between wealth and income.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.740]   I mean, we know a lot of people, all of us,
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.340]   who have very high incomes but have no wealth.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.400]   They're in debt up to their eardrums,
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.580]   but they have high income.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.520]   So it's sort of an interesting discussion
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.520]   about is high income really a measure of wealth?
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.900]   And my answer is no, probably not.
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.460]   But unfortunately, it's the one
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.060]   that most government entities use
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.120]   for figuring things out, who gets what,
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.420]   and how the pie is sliced up.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.020]   - So essentially, when talking
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.540]   about different types of wealth,
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.720]   again, there's lots of different ways
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.040]   to come at the question.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.300]   One thing that I see with a lot of clients
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.620]   is occasionally they don't understand the difference
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.660]   between, let's say, liquid and illiquid wealth.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.680]   And sometimes that comes in the form
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.020]   of people who buy property, real estate in particular,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.860]   and they say this is a good investment.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.760]   And I hearken back to the example
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.980]   of someone who has a $10 million house
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.100]   but doesn't have the liquidity to pay for the taxes
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.820]   or for their daily expenses, for that matter.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.420]   And so what I try to do is get people
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.820]   to understand that there is value in liquidity
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.140]   in terms of sort of dealing with risk,
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.260]   dealing with lifestyle issues, dealing with spending.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.100]   And there can be value with illiquidity
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.180]   as it relates to being able to get a better return
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.340]   based on that investment's upside.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.580]   And many times, by being illiquid,
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.900]   it has more flexibility to make better investments
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.380]   and to do better things to increase value.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.620]   That's one aspect of it.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.780]   From a time perspective, current wealth versus legacy wealth.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.740]   And a demarcation for that for some people might be death.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.520]   It might be retirement.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.580]   But it's generally that line when
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.740]   you're talking about your current needs
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.860]   that you need to fund and then things
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.780]   that you want to leave as part of your legacy,
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.780]   whether it's to your kids, whether it's
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.040]   to your philanthropies, whether it's to other causes
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.180]   that you think are interesting.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.220]   Thinking about wealth in terms of function on that front
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.140]   oftentimes can be very interesting in terms
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.140]   of helping people think about how to invest funds accordingly.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.300]   As an example of that, and certainly the estate planning
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.660]   world talks about this in great detail.
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.460]   But from a tax perspective, if you're
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.540]   able to put assets that are framed for longer time
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.660]   horizons, i.e.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.540]   for legacy functions, you're able to get
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.960]   the benefit of compounding.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.540]   If you put it in different structures,
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.820]   you might have better taxation of those assets.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.940]   And ultimately, if you're able to bend things around
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.780]   a little bit, you might be able to use them
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.420]   in a tax-efficient way for things like philanthropies
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.660]   and so on.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.020]   Whereas if you need money as it relates to saving up
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.160]   to buy a house or to pay for a wedding or something like that,
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.740]   you don't want things to go up and down and not have it ready
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.420]   for you.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.940]   So if you have a daughter who's getting married in three years
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.020]   and you've budgeted $100,000 for that wedding,
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.380]   to put that into Tesla or into Bitcoin or something
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.540]   like that where that value may go up and down,
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.620]   you may find yourself having put $100,000 away
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.780]   and having it worth $50,000 at the time you need it.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.260]   And so that's where that liquidity and illiquidity
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.100]   component comes in and how it relates
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.500]   to current versus legacy wealth.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.980]   Time horizon, as you know, Rick, is a big function
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.980]   in putting together a portfolio.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.380]   And I think it's an important function in just sort
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.140]   of understanding what your wealth is
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.340]   and what kind of investments you should be thinking about.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:30.020]   Fraser, there are people who have unexpected wealth.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.460]   I mean, they hit it big.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.100]   Either they, well, hit the lottery
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.380]   or they unexpectedly get a very large inheritance
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:43.020]   or they were lucky enough to invest in--
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.140]   well, go to work for a company and get a lot of stock
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.100]   and stock auctions.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.300]   And the next thing you know, they're worth $20, $25 million
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.940]   because of that.
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.920]   And they're suddenly wealthy.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.060]   And I find these people to be very scared in many ways.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.820]   They don't know how to handle this wealth.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.860]   I was just talking with an individual yesterday,
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.740]   as a matter of fact, who is in his early 20s.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.020]   And he's going to be getting a check for $10 million
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.140]   for an invention that he created.
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.140]   And then there will be more residual after that.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.300]   And he's just very scared about this.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.700]   What advice would you give to someone like that?
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.300]   Well, first of all, it's a great problem to have.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.100]   The first thing I would try to impart on people
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.980]   is to say, OK, you now have a really good set of issues here.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.700]   But this lucky windfall, let's call it--
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.420]   and let's kind of assume for a second
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:46.060]   that there's little planning that's been done for it.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.900]   But this even applies to, say, the first round draft
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.380]   choice in the NBA or the NFL, et cetera.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.540]   Those types of people, I try to impart on them the idea
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.580]   that this chunk of money, a way to think about it
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:07.020]   is to annuitize it for your long-term benefit.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.540]   Now, I don't mean to take the money and go buy an annuity.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.060]   I'm saying that this $10 million,
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.700]   let's expect it to last the rest of your life.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.260]   And let's expect it to fund your legacy going forward.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:26.700]   And to reframe it as away from, I've got this windfall,
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:32.280]   and I've got to watch people looking over the fence
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.900]   and wanting something from me, or am I going to spend too
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.620]   much, those are good and valid fears.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.060]   And I think the scarier one is someone
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.700]   who inherits or gets that windfall
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.020]   and doesn't have that fear.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.660]   And you have to really deprogram them
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.580]   to thinking that $10 million equals $10 million
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.740]   a year going forward.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.940]   But for those people who are equipped with that fear,
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.500]   I would say, look, this is something that, in my opinion,
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.260]   you need to think about what you want your life to look
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.740]   like going forward and what that looks
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.660]   like on a year-to-year basis.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:13.180]   I would also say that I would take a year
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.780]   before making any big decisions, because it's
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.620]   going to take a year to think about what
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.340]   that kind of windfall looks like and what that,
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.900]   from a current income, that it generates looks like
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.580]   and how it impacts your life.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.020]   So for someone who gets a $10 million lottery winning
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.960]   or something like that and then goes and quits
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.060]   their job the next day, those are the ones
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.020]   who are really at risk.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.300]   Because now they have completely turned their life upside down.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.580]   Any structure they may have had going forward
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.940]   has been completely swamped.
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.180]   I would really tell people, number one,
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.700]   think about what your life looks like on a if $10 million
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.900]   generates $400,000 a year type of basis,
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.100]   what does $400,000 a year look like to your life going
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.980]   forward?
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:07.460]   And I would not make any decisions for at least six
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.480]   months and probably a year about anything related to moving,
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.500]   related to quitting your job, et cetera.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.140]   Absent some crazy circumstance happening.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.980]   But I would really take the time,
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.580]   and that goes to everything from picking advisors
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:27.140]   and talking to good people and really taking the time
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:32.140]   to sort of bed this new impact in.
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.620]   It's a positive one, but it's one
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.260]   that it's not like a big health change.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.820]   You're going from one type of thing to another very quickly.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.540]   Often I talk with clients and they say to me,
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.340]   how should I structure my estate?
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.660]   Should I do marital trusts?
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.460]   Should I do special needs trusts?
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.100]   Should I do different types of trusts?
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.780]   How are you counseling people on whether or not
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.700]   they should be putting their assets in a trust?
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.980]   How are trusts being used today versus, let's say,
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.780]   10 years ago when they were used mostly
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.820]   to try to avoid estate taxes?
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.700]   Sure, so I think the universal truth
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.020]   is that trusts as a tool are to affect estate planning goals.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.380]   And that's kind of where I start out when talking to people.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.980]   And sometimes when people go on the cocktail--
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.780]   if it was coffee, they'd be more sensible--
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.900]   the cocktail circuit.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.500]   And they hear about different transactions,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.180]   or they hear about sort of the flavor
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.140]   of the month in terms of a tax planning angle
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.340]   or something like that.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.500]   And that's driving the planning.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.300]   It's kind of going backward.
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.900]   From an estate planning perspective,
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.620]   I think the smart thing to do or an intelligent thing
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.460]   to do for better long-term planning
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.620]   is to understand, OK, here's the money or the net worth
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.100]   that I have, and here are my goals for it.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.780]   Do I want my kids to benefit from it?
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.660]   Do I want my charities to benefit from it?
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.120]   Are there things that I'm trying to look around the corner
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.020]   and protect against?
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.300]   And so you start by having an honest discussion
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.620]   with yourself and your advisor saying, here is where I am.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.180]   Here is my fact pattern in time.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.460]   And this is what I want to plan for.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.260]   Now, in the estate planning world,
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.620]   if you die without any documents whatsoever,
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.740]   you die in test date.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.140]   And then that goes automatically to the court system.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.260]   And the state essentially decides,
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.140]   according to its general rules, how your assets
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.980]   are divided going forward.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.820]   99.99% of people don't find that particularly advisable.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.660]   So step one is to say, OK, what documents do I really
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.260]   need in place?
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.860]   Document one for everyone.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.340]   Whether you're 1% or 0% or whatever you think,
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.060]   you should have a will, which allows
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.700]   for the bequeathing of your assets
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.900]   in a manner in which you decide you want to do it.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.460]   Now, forget tax planning for a second.
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.220]   That's just a way to do it so that you're
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.140]   able to put forward your assets in the way you want to do it,
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.700]   and that's not according to state law.
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.900]   Step two is the power of attorney and health care
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.140]   proxies in case you are disabled and can't
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.660]   make decisions for yourself.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.100]   You don't want to have a situation where
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.820]   there is different interpretations over who
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.900]   has control over the decision making
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.780]   if they have to make health care decisions for you.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.100]   Terri Schiavo is the case that really brought this to light
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.260]   where, unfortunately, that person was brain dead
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.500]   for a while, and her estate planning was unclear,
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.020]   and it was unclear whether she should
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.060]   be taken off the feeding tube or kept on.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.300]   That kind of documentation, I think,
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.900]   is useful and important going forward.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.460]   So then you get to the point where
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.140]   wills go through a process called probate, where they
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:51.340]   are proven within a state court, and essentially, the will
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.140]   is put there.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.860]   Hopefully, the I's are dotted and T's are crossed,
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.500]   and there are enough witnesses and things like that.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.220]   And then the court goes through that process,
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.660]   and then the assets can get distributed by the executor.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.100]   Occasionally-- not occasionally.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.020]   This is much more standard now, and especially
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.500]   in the high net worth space, there
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.460]   is the concept of a revocable trust.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.660]   And this is usually where most people first
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.460]   hear the word trust beyond the idea of setting up
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.220]   a, quote unquote, "fund for their kids"
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.500]   or something like that.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.540]   But a revocable trust is a way to take the bulk of your assets
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.180]   and put it in a trust that is revocable,
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.620]   meaning you can change it up until you die.
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.900]   And then upon your death, it automatically
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.980]   flows into a trust, and those assets
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.260]   are distributed according to the terms of the trust.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.300]   Why is this useful?
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.340]   This is useful because you avoid the probate process.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.500]   It's less expensive.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.660]   It's autopilot.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.900]   It happens very quickly, and the executor
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.380]   doesn't have to really do anything.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.340]   The trustee comes on board, and the assets
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.660]   are dispersed proportionately, et cetera.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.420]   Just as a quick aside, I would say
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.740]   that it's a good idea to put bulky assets
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.980]   into a revocable trust and to have a will on top of that,
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.820]   because revocable trust planning doesn't really
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.620]   work unless the assets are titled
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.980]   in the name of the trust.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.820]   Otherwise, it goes back into your regular estate,
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.820]   and hopefully you have a will that governs that.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.780]   So I think standard procedure is to have both in place.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.860]   That's estate planning 101.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:23.260]   Then the concept gets into place when people say, OK,
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.460]   I've kind of thought about my family fact pattern,
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.860]   and I have things I need to worry about.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.820]   Is my son a drug addict?
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.340]   I have a daughter who is young, and I don't
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.020]   know who she's going to marry.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.100]   I don't want my daughter's new husband
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.780]   to have access to the assets.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.980]   And by the same token, I'd like to leave some of it
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.180]   to my charities, and there may be a tax reason
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.220]   for that type of thing.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.860]   That's when trusts really start to come into play.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.780]   So against that backdrop, that's where the need for structure
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.980]   to avoid next generation problems comes into play.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.420]   And I think that's consistent now
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.340]   and has been from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, and beyond.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.740]   It's just the tools that are at our disposal
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.220]   for some of those things.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.600]   They're not necessarily different,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.620]   but sometimes they get more popular.
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.540]   And then to sort of bridge into the next component of what
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.500]   we're talking about, I think what's
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.660]   interesting now versus 10 or 20 years ago
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.100]   is the fact that there is relatively settled law--
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.940]   and of course, this could get changed in 2021--
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.780]   but relatively settled law and settled tools
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.540]   that are at our disposal to avoid things like estate tax
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.500]   and other forms of taxes.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.940]   Essentially, in a quick summary, there
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.420]   are things called estate value freezes,
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:46.040]   where by placing assets into a trust at a current value,
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.620]   you are able to pass the growth on to the next generation.
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.740]   These are especially interesting right now
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.860]   because we are in a generationally low interest rate
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.340]   environment, and we are at a generationally high estate tax
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.780]   exemption environment.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.220]   So there is a way to get double the leverage using
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.940]   a lot of different techniques to get assets out of one estate
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.900]   and into the hands of beneficiaries going forward.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.780]   And if you combine that with other charitable techniques,
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.540]   you can get even more leverage out of it.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.820]   So that's, I think, what's different between now
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.260]   and 20 years ago.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.740]   We've got very big estate tax exemption capabilities.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.660]   We have very low interest rates.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.260]   And those two things together can
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.280]   be a powerful set of tools.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.820]   How do you go about finding a good estate planning attorney
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.780]   right at the beginning?
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.340]   A lot of people ask me, who should I use?
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.620]   And I'm rather uncomfortable because I don't know
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.300]   who's good and who isn't.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.500]   You have to be careful whom you refer to people
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.300]   because you have the $1,500 an hour types on down
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.100]   to those with sole proprietorship practices.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.940]   I try to come up with a list of three people.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.700]   Usually, if I know where the client is coming from that
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.700]   are ideological fits, that are personality fits,
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.060]   that it's not too aggressive or not too conservative,
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.420]   depending on the person.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.420]   And then somewhere up and down the price range.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.540]   If I'm out there and I don't know of the community
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.740]   real well, I would go to--
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.460]   one's accountant is usually a good place
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.180]   to start if they have that in place
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.500]   because accountants are always dealing with attorneys, both
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.260]   estate planning and otherwise.
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.900]   That's a good place to start from a networking standpoint.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.580]   If people use a financial advisor,
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.900]   they will have a pretty well-established network
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.420]   of estate planning attorneys as well.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.260]   And then if they have a lawyer for other uses,
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.500]   whether it's real estate or business or something
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.180]   like that, many times they either
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.740]   have that within their own firm or have
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.380]   worked with other people in terms of business succession
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.100]   or other issues that have popped up.
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.540]   Start with the state of residence.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.900]   And then for those people who are really, really large
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.460]   and gigantic, oftentimes there are
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.980]   national or international practices.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.340]   So if you're in Nebraska, I'm not
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.780]   sure I'd want to be doing Columbia inbound estate
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.700]   planning.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.740]   But there are people who deal with that.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.360]   But sometimes larger national law firms,
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.740]   they'll certainly take your call.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.240]   And if they can't do it, they'll direct you.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:14.060]   I think that there's always an issue with parents talking
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.700]   with children about how they are setting up their estate
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.980]   or children who are looking at their parents trying
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:26.060]   to talk with them about how they should set up their estate.
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:30.580]   A family dynamic goes on where even though different
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.460]   generations should be talking with each other sometimes
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.580]   or a lot of times, it doesn't happen well.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.980]   Maybe there's some hard feelings.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.940]   I've dealt with families where the parents thought
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.980]   it was important that all five of their children
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.160]   be co-trustees of everything.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:46.660]   Yikes.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.660]   And it gets to be very, very messy.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.620]   Can you talk about some of the family dynamics
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.380]   and how you might be able to facilitate these conversations
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.840]   and make them simpler as far as decision making?
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.780]   What has been your experience?
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:08.660]   Well, and it's a big, deep, and important question.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.540]   And it underpins everything.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.780]   I think that-- let me reference two TV shows
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.660]   because sometimes people say, well,
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.820]   what does this relate to it?
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:24.580]   I grew up enjoying Dallas with J.R. Ewing and the like.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.740]   Because he always chewed up the scenery
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.700]   and it was a lot of fun.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.180]   But watching the dynamics play out
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.380]   amongst people of the same generation
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.340]   with husbands and wives and kids and what
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.660]   happened with a significant oil empire,
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.700]   that was sort of my first exposure to it
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.500]   from a sort of entertainment perspective.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.020]   The show Succession on HBO deals with it
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.580]   as well, where you have people who have different ideas
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.460]   about how things should happen.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.500]   Essentially, it comes back to two truths.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.980]   The first one is that there is a saying that
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.060]   transcends a culture called shirtsleeves
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.140]   to shirtsleeves in three generations, where
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.660]   the first generation makes the money
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.420]   and the second generation kind of spends it and enjoys it.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.580]   And then the third generation loses it.
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.980]   And this is the offshoot of the idea--
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.940]   this is me talking-- where I think that over the long haul,
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:21.140]   assets increase linearly while liabilities
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.980]   increase geometrically.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.740]   So everything that you're doing from estate planning purposes
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.660]   and from investing and so on is trying
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.100]   to fight that natural law of asset depletion.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.780]   And against that backdrop, that second generation
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.340]   and beyond, where the people who created the money,
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.940]   they created the culture that accumulated
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.620]   assets, that built businesses, that generated the wealth.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.900]   How do you get that to the next generation?
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.180]   How do you have people who can enjoy the wealth,
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:56.940]   use the wealth, take advantage of the advantage in many ways,
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.860]   and build off of that without creating entitlement?
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.540]   And that is the thing that most people really, really
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.460]   worry about.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.540]   So some things to think about on that front.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:10.420]   I think that communication and education
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:14.660]   are big sets of tools that are important on that front.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.420]   Step one, I think from a communication standpoint,
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:22.220]   to get started early is good in terms of fostering discussion
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.140]   around why things are the way they are,
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.580]   how the wealth was generated, and what it means.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.380]   You can debate what is too early or not early.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.060]   But one way to sort of foster communication--
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.700]   and I think a tool that's interesting--
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.620]   is the idea of having shared philanthropy.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.620]   So what does that mean?
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.420]   And could it be used by someone not in the 1%?
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.540]   Absolutely.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.700]   And here's what I would say.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.860]   If you're parents and you've got, let's say, three kids,
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.620]   and let's say you have $5 to give away philanthropically,
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.260]   I think an interesting exercise is
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.980]   to give each of the kids $1 to give away
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.060]   under their own set of values, what they want to do.
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.580]   And then have the three kids decide together
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.460]   how to give away that other $2 of the $5
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.060]   that you set aside for philanthropy.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.220]   What does that do for you?
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.220]   Number one, it gives you some insight as to what's
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.780]   important with the kids.
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.220]   Number two, it gives them some idea
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.140]   of how to work together to make a decision around money,
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.220]   around a very low stakes and very positive situation,
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.860]   namely giving it away to a charity that deserves it.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.980]   I think if you build a culture around that early and young,
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.300]   I think that gets the kids not only
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.820]   seeing what's important to them and what's
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.980]   important to them jointly, but it also
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.420]   gives them some insight and some context into what
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.860]   they're good and not good at.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.740]   So out of those three kids, maybe one of them
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.420]   is totally disinterested.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.300]   So there's some context around that.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.220]   Maybe one of them is particularly good at math
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:50.740]   and driven.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.940]   And maybe they're the one that, if they end up
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.660]   running the family company, there's
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.140]   a good couple decade track record of understanding
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.260]   that those talents were in place.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.660]   And maybe the other kid is somewhere in between.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.380]   Or maybe artsy and off to do Peace Corps type things.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:08.380]   And that while their endeavors are just
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.900]   as valuable as maybe the business aspect of it,
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.940]   it's just different.
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.460]   And so as a set of parents looking at that and sort
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.820]   of seeing that interplay when they are sort of coming up
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.860]   with the why as far as how their estate plan is put forward
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:28.020]   and put in place, the kids have some context around that
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.660]   already.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.380]   And one of the worst things that happens,
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.860]   I see, is when the estate plan essentially
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.100]   is laid out to the kids upon the death of the matriarch
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.300]   or patriarch.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.220]   And they find out that things were done for reasons
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.700]   that weren't stated and combine that with decades of baggage.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.940]   And he wronged me because of this.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.340]   And I didn't get invited to that over time.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.100]   And I was excluded from this.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.820]   That's when conflict really happens
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.020]   and when it gets particularly expensive.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.380]   So that's one tool.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.900]   And then to add on to that, and I'm
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.300]   going to borrow from Tom Rogerson, who
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.260]   is an expert in the family governance field.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:09.380]   He has the idea of a vacation fund, which essentially--
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.100]   let's say you have those three kids--
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.940]   the idea of having a fund for vacation.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.300]   So let's say you set aside $5,000 for the vacation.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.140]   And at a certain level, let's say the kids are all teenagers.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:25.020]   But you have the three kids make joint decisions
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.620]   around the investments of that money.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.180]   And it's going to teach them very quickly.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.420]   They're going to touch the stove and put it in Bitcoin too late.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.700]   Or they're going to put it in Tesla too soon.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.220]   Or maybe they'll get conservative quickly.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.740]   But they'll learn on-the-ground investment lessons
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.100]   with money that isn't the corpus of the family estate.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.260]   And at the same time, they learn to work
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.620]   with each other on money.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.740]   They learn to have a shared set of values and education
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.820]   around how investment decisions are made.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.540]   And this can happen at the foundation level
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.180]   too if you want to do it for a family foundation.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.500]   But I like it in the family vacation mode.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.860]   Because if it goes from $5,000 to $10,000
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.820]   and you have a better vacation, there's
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.940]   a real concept of shared accountability.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.100]   And if the parents buy into that as well,
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.420]   and the whole family has shared accountability,
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.940]   the lessons go beyond just the investment component.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.340]   And they go to the family decision-making component,
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.940]   and then the context around the long-term planning
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.340]   of the family assets component.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.500]   So that's another tool.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.380]   A third tool, which is usually kind of around in the--
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.940]   let's call it the family office world--
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.900]   is the idea of a family bank.
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.780]   And that can really be the idea of kids
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.660]   who have entrepreneurial ideas can come up and give a business
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.340]   plan to a group of people as decided by the family.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.220]   And you put some structure around that.
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.860]   But in a sense, kids learn how to come up with an idea,
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.140]   put a business plan around it.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.600]   And you can obviously support that and bring your advisors in
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.060]   and get as involved or not involved as you want.
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.140]   But get that in place so that the kids get up
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.220]   and they learn to think of the plan,
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.980]   think about how to execute it, and think about selling it
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.680]   to a dispassionate--
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.020]   although they're family members--
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.940]   but a dispassionate group of people.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.620]   And that's a life lesson.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.180]   It's that kind of experience that I
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.100]   think raises kids above the level of the entitled
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.300]   and at least gives them a little bit of experience
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.420]   into how the world works.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.540]   You've talked a lot about parents talking with children.
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.780]   But I also see it the other way.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.940]   I see parents not opening up to their children
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.920]   and their children needing to have conversations
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.900]   with their parents.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:39.140]   I'll often talk with a client and gathering their information
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.420]   and talking with them about their own retirement
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.420]   if they're in their 40s.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:48.500]   I'll ask things like, are you in line to inherit any money?
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.860]   And sometimes there's silence.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.940]   And one person will say to the other, well, my family, no.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.900]   But my spouse, yes.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.800]   And I say, well, what kind of assets
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.980]   are we talking about that you would inherit?
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:04.980]   And they say, well, I don't really
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.220]   know how much my parents have.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.900]   I don't know what it is.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.420]   But I think they have a substantial amount.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.780]   But I don't know.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.080]   They're in their 40s and sometimes in their 50s.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.200]   And they still don't know what their parents have.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.580]   So how do you get the conversation
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.660]   to go the other way?
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.580]   Well, that's a great question because it's a big deal.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.220]   And the worst thing that happens is people
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.420]   assume they have something.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.500]   And then they are displeasantly surprised or unpleasantly
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.100]   surprised that it's not there.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.440]   And the life that they'd kind of penciled out
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.220]   based on the assets that they thought were there aren't.
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:42.820]   Or worse, this is kind of in more in the--
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.300]   let's call it in the $1 to even $10 million range,
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.700]   but maybe more like in the $1 to $5 million range.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.780]   The costs of health care are not going down.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:54.340]   And the idea that Medicare is going
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.940]   to take care of everything, I think it's dangerous.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.540]   I've seen it with my own family.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:05.060]   My parents dealt with my grandmother who made it to 102.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.580]   Sadly, the last seven years of that
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.980]   weren't particularly pleasant because of dementia.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.420]   And it cost thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.300]   and dozens of thousands of dollars, almost per month,
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.420]   especially at the end, to make that happen.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:23.460]   So to answer your question, how do you break that divide?
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.140]   I think there are a couple of interesting things going on.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.580]   Number one, I would say an interesting component
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.900]   to kind of back your way into the conversation,
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.420]   especially if you're in your 40s, 50s, et cetera,
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.860]   is to say, mom and dad, I'm doing my estate planning
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.300]   for myself now.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.500]   I'm reviewing it.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.580]   I've seen the tax laws.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.700]   I've heard a lot about it.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.740]   It's time to get things buttoned up and reviewed.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:51.300]   Can you fill me in on what is and isn't available,
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.580]   if not for me, then for my kids, so
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.420]   that I know how to make decisions on my estate planning
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:00.180]   that affect them, that don't double up or cut in half
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.780]   the benefits that I think are important for them?
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.700]   That may be met with one response or another.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.740]   But that's one way to get it started,
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.180]   to say that you're doing the responsible thing by getting
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.180]   your estate planning looked at and in order.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.540]   And you need more information to make that happen.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.380]   And that part of that information
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:21.500]   needs to come from above, from the more senior generation.
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.100]   The second part about it is that, mom and dad,
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.420]   I need to plan for your health care going forward.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.780]   And we need to make this a joint decision,
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.380]   because there are lots of different variabilities
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.020]   in place.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.660]   And it's extremely expensive.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.060]   And if we don't think about this correctly,
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.700]   we could be left up the creek without a paddle.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.340]   And it could be left with everything
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.660]   from not much in the way of access to health care
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.940]   facilities to just a dangerous situation
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.500]   where a sudden death could occur.
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.700]   And we don't understand where things are.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.860]   I think an interesting tool on that front
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.780]   is to have the idea of a fire drill.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.500]   And it's oftentimes very difficult to get
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.380]   families to execute on this.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.220]   But I think it's interesting to say, you know what?
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.900]   OK, this is all sort of hypothetical.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.020]   But dad just died.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.820]   What happens next?
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.420]   OK, step one, where are the documents?
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.260]   Step two, who are the advisors we have to talk to?
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.660]   The lawyer, the accountant.
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.820]   Is there a health care facilitator?
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.940]   Funeral arrangements, that type of thing.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.540]   There are going to be people who are sort of recalcitrant.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.220]   And they're not going to want to do that.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.220]   And that's tough.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.060]   But I like the idea of couching it
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.940]   in terms of a family fire drill.
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.340]   What happens if?
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.100]   What happens when?
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:38.740]   If this, then what?
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:42.620]   Doing that maybe once a year, even once every two years,
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.900]   at the very least, you know how things
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.540]   are going to get executed.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.300]   And then you can back into what's
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:51.860]   in those documents if it gets particularly complicated.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.820]   That'd be another way I'd be thinking about it.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.780]   I'd be thinking about it in terms of, you know,
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.660]   how do I best plan for my family?
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:01.940]   I need to use the first generation's information
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.300]   from them to make my planning work.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.060]   And then step two, it's a very good thing for this family
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.660]   to understand what happens if there's an emergency
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.580]   or there's a problem and to run a drill off of that.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:14.700]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.340]   Again, I speak with a lot of clients
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.700]   who have parents' assets in probate for a year,
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.980]   year and a half.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.660]   It just takes forever, in some cases,
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.660]   to resolve some of these things because there wasn't really
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:28.820]   any planning.
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.340]   Or the parents didn't communicate with the children.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.300]   Or the children didn't initiate a conversation
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.540]   with the parents or something.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:37.140]   But in the end, it does fall on the children
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.060]   who, if they inherit the money, they're
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.540]   the ones who have to sort it all out.
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.460]   And it can take a very long period of time.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.100]   So it's a good idea, if possible,
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.820]   to have that conversation if the parents and the children
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.900]   are willing to do it.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.580]   I mean, the one thing that I think is useful for everybody
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:57.300]   is to have a sort of go-bag or a list of documents and contact
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.940]   information so that even if you don't know exactly what
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.460]   the process looks like, you know whom to call quickly.
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.260]   That first week is going to be brutal for most people.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.380]   It's emotionally fraught.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.620]   There's problems.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.060]   If you have sort of an end-of-life situation,
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.820]   those early periods of time are important.
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:17.100]   If you can have some checklists laid out of things
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.420]   that you should be thinking about,
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.100]   and if you can drill ahead of time
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.700]   and to sort of impart on the senior generation
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.180]   as to why it's important to have these in place,
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.220]   that may help break the ice a little bit.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.060]   Well, Fraser, given everything you just
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.820]   talked about, the family dynamics
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.220]   and the initial part of the estate plan,
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.980]   can we get further into trusts?
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.460]   Sure, so as I just laid out, the idea
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.860]   that if you can understand why you're doing things
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:47.940]   and the purpose of it, the use of trusts is to--
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:49.900]   there are lots of different functions for them.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.820]   But the idea is to provide structure around the wealth
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.620]   in order to pursue other goals.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.420]   Goals can be asset protection.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.300]   It can be tax avoidance.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.260]   It could be putting structure around the wealth
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.420]   so that kids don't spend willy-nilly
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:07.780]   or that they don't go down a certain path in life
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.180]   that you think is inappropriate for them.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.620]   And as we sort of talk these things through,
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.580]   I think the idea that anything that
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.620]   can be done to preserve the assets
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.820]   or forestall that shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves phenomenon,
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.300]   that's the point of a trust.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.780]   And for those matriarchs and patriarchs
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:29.660]   that have ideas about the wealth that they created
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.300]   and the impact and the legacy that it provides,
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.620]   that's the point of a trust, is to sort of put
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.860]   that structure around it so that the decisions made
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.180]   as to how it is spent and how it's invested
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.980]   and how it's protected, ultimately,
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:44.860]   allow it to be preserved for as long as possible.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.180]   A lot of clients are talking about Nevada trusts.
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.580]   They're talking about Dakota trusts.
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.100]   They're talking about all of these different states
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.540]   changing their trust laws and moving around going to and using
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:57.940]   different state laws.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:58.940]   What is that all about?
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.260]   And how can somebody utilize that?
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.500]   Sure, so again, this is what I'm doing in my day job
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.180]   and sort of advising larger clients and other clients
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.700]   about how to sort of use jurisdiction
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.780]   to your advantage, which you described Nevada, South Dakota,
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.620]   Delaware, Tennessee, which is where I'm working.
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.420]   I work in New York for a Tennessee trust company.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:25.740]   These places all have trust laws that have various advantages.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.740]   Now, first and foremost, especially
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.740]   if you're in California or New York,
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.060]   places I just described have no state income tax.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.860]   And so there are a lot of different things
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.060]   you can do with your estate planning
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.260]   and sometimes your income tax planning
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.060]   to be able to take advantage of that non-state income tax
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.740]   feature of those states.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.820]   These states also have asset protection features.
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.500]   So whenever there's a possibility of lawsuit
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.340]   or something else where there's a creditor in play
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.380]   that you want to defend your assets against,
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.460]   these types of jurisdictions are interesting
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.260]   compared to other ones.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:00.020]   There's a notion where you can bifurcate roles.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:03.220]   So you don't have to have one trustee or one corporate
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.980]   trustee do everything.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.900]   And so Tennessee and the other jurisdictions described
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.940]   have direction trusts where you can
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.780]   appoint people who are good at various parts of the trust
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.180]   process, whether it's investments, the administration
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.500]   component, or the distribution component.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:23.220]   You can divvy up those roles as well.
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.940]   And there's all sorts of other different features.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:30.260]   For instance, in Tennessee, the trust can last 360 years.
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.980]   Some places are limited to the rule
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.700]   against perpetuities, which basically
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.420]   caps you at a generation.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.780]   So for a real multi-generational wealth,
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.460]   one of these usual suspects, as I call them,
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:46.420]   from a jurisdiction standpoint is particularly interesting.
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.100]   So just to be clear, I don't need to live in Tennessee
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.500]   or I don't need to live in Nevada
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.460]   to be able to use these trusts.
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:52.940]   Nope.
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.540]   If you have a corporate trustee or an administrative trustee
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.260]   who serves in that function, you get the benefits
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.900]   of that jurisdiction's law.
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.780]   And let me get down to one question
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.420]   that I have all the time.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:10.260]   I always ask, who is going to be the trustee?
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.940]   Should it be five children all equally,
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.220]   or how do you deal with that?
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.820]   Well, it's complicated for a lot of different reasons.
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:21.460]   The trust has three main parts to it.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:25.020]   It has a grantor, which is someone who forms the trust
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.860]   and funds it with assets.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:28.740]   It has a trustee.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.980]   And that trustee has three main functions.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:33.660]   They have to safeguard and report on the assets.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.780]   They have to invest the assets prudently.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.140]   And they have to distribute it to the beneficiaries
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.700]   according to the terms of the trust
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.820]   and then state law if it's silent.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:45.060]   Then the third part of the trust is the beneficiaries.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:50.820]   So against that backdrop, that's a trust in a general sense.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.380]   When you're picking a trustee, oftentimes people
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.660]   have an idea of what that word means
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.860]   and don't have an idea of those three functions
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.420]   I just described.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:05.100]   Finding that one person who is both a good investment manager,
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.100]   is good at taking notes and making sure
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.300]   that the tax returns are filed and that they're also--
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.300]   that the assets are safeguarded and that the reporting is
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.100]   correct, that's another function.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.020]   And then also that person who is able to have
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.220]   the hard conversations around how to distribute those assets
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.740]   when they have the discretion to do so.
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.060]   And a hard conversation might be a son
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.020]   wants to pillage the trust to buy a Lamborghini
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:31.740]   versus the daughter wants to use the trust to buy a house
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.740]   versus what does it say in the trust
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.340]   versus what does state law say.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.260]   Finding that individual who can deal
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.380]   with all three of those functions is hard.
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.260]   And it's doubly hard because people
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.780]   who understand that role and understand those three
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:50.700]   functions understand that it's a high liability situation
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.820]   and that they should get paid for it.
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:56.180]   That in turn argues for a trustee
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.780]   that understands the risks, hopefully
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:03.020]   has some idea of understanding the family's dynamics,
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.020]   and then also has the structure in place
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.260]   to make those decisions so that when something goes wrong,
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.780]   which invariably it does, and siblings start fighting
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.860]   and they think one's been favored over another,
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:18.620]   or maybe keeping that position in Kodak wasn't a good idea,
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.260]   that they're going to get sued.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.660]   So choosing a trustee is, when you really
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:26.100]   get into the weeds on it, very difficult. Oftentimes,
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.860]   corporate trustees are brought in, and they can be expensive
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.980]   and they cost, but they help soak up
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.460]   some of those functions that individuals may not
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.580]   be very good at.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.620]   They can provide structure around the distribution
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:38.260]   process.
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.740]   They can provide structure around the investment process,
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.540]   they can provide the back office for those administrative
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:45.540]   details.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:49.540]   So when one's coming up with a trust, the choice of trustee
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.260]   is extremely important, not least of which--
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.460]   and I talk about this in, I think,
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.380]   about two sentences in my book, which is to say,
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.940]   trustees get old, individuals do.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:04.420]   So the family lawyer who puts this together at age 65,
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.240]   they may be 95 when the situation comes
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.580]   to pass where there's conflict or real judgment
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.780]   needs to take place.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:15.660]   And that's tricky, because that person is probably retired,
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:19.060]   or they shouldn't be making decisions for whatever reason.
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:22.540]   It's important either to create sort of a situation
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:25.740]   where there's help that is going to be consistent,
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.460]   even if people move in and out, or that your trustees
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:31.460]   and that your advisors around your wealth
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.420]   get younger as you get older.
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:37.020]   If a family were to go down the road of hiring
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.540]   a professional trustee instead of family members
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:46.140]   so that there is this consistency and no favoritism
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:50.140]   or ambiguity, what would that cost a family?
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:53.420]   So it's a good question, and it depends which functions
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.460]   the trustee takes on.
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.380]   If you have a full mandate for a trust,
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:01.820]   meaning investment management, trust administration,
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.660]   distribution responsibilities, I would
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:09.660]   expect that to be in the 1 and 1/4 plus percent range.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.540]   I think 25 basis points for the trust administration,
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.900]   1% for the investment administration.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.900]   Obviously, as you move up the ladder
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:21.780]   and those functions get delineated,
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.980]   there's negotiation around that.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:28.580]   By the same token, if you hire a lawyer to be a trustee for you,
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.580]   and that happens very frequently,
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.380]   they may have an hourly rate, they may have a flat rate.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.700]   But I would say that, in essence,
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:41.500]   kind of in that 1% plus range is probably a good place to start.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.420]   And it will vary depending on assets, functions,
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.460]   complications, things like that.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.220]   So not inexpensive, I guess.
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.940]   It's a double negative.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:53.300]   Well, it can be expensive.
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:57.260]   Now, many times people balk at the price to get,
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.060]   let's call it a professional trustee,
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.540]   and they have family members serve in trustee roles.
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.620]   And very often, that's fine.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:11.860]   But I think the idea is that when something has to happen
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:16.940]   and if there is the potential for a lawsuit for conflict
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:20.580]   reasons, et cetera, I think it's a good idea
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.980]   to start thinking about professional trustees.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.940]   Because an individual who forgets to file a tax return
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:34.820]   or forgets the election of some state law that needs to happen,
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:35.700]   they're liable.
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:36.340]   That's it.
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.780]   And I think many people who take that role on,
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:42.420]   let's call it for free or for de minimis,
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:45.300]   they may be saving the trust on fees,
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.660]   but they may be really piling on liability for themselves.
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.100]   And it's something, in fact, they should probably
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:54.220]   investigate some liability insurance as well.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.020]   A lot of people come to me and they
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:00.220]   ask me to refer them to professional trustees.
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:02.700]   But it's not my area of expertise,
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.860]   and I don't know how to go about evaluating
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.020]   one professional trustee against another.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.740]   How would somebody do this who is looking
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.060]   for a professional trustee?
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.900]   Well, the first thing I would do, if you're
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.860]   going through an estate planning attorney,
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:21.260]   they should have a pretty robust network of trustees,
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:24.580]   both individual and corporate, to choose from if they
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.100]   won't do it themselves.
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.340]   Failing that, financial advisors,
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:29.860]   people who work with them oftentimes,
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.220]   they have another set of people in their network
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.900]   that sometimes works.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:38.380]   I tend to sort of gravitate toward the legal community
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.060]   for referrals on that front.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.620]   It can really be like unearthing truffles,
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:45.020]   because the person who has the expertise with the family
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.660]   dynamic and the assets, sometimes
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.340]   that can be a really specialized person.
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.780]   But being part of a trust company,
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.420]   I'm also more than willing to take
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.740]   any calls or any entreaties from your listenership
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.020]   if they have any questions about it.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.420]   Let's get into a final area, because this is the Bogle
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:03.500]   Heads-On Investing Show.
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:07.100]   Let's talk about investing and the ultra-high net worth
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.820]   and the 1%ers.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:13.060]   I mean, these people have access to really special mutual funds
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.660]   that outperform all the time, correct?
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.060]   I guess.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.620]   I'm sort of a--
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.380]   my theory on investments-- and again,
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:27.740]   I work for a trust company that provides trustee services, not
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:28.860]   investment management.
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:33.300]   I'm a big fan of after-tax, after-fees, after-inflation,
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.380]   and then I'll put in parentheses, after-spend.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.820]   So as a trustee, I try to fight the after-spend part
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.460]   and try to really sort of add value on that front.
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:45.300]   And then to make sure that we're operating
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.820]   in as an efficient manner as possible on the fee and tax
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.100]   side of things.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.940]   And then asset allocation tends to take care of the rest.
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:56.860]   That said, many trusts, especially
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:59.620]   ultra-high net worth people, they
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:04.780]   believe in alternative assets, special situations.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.980]   Many times, they built their wealth on something
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:09.060]   where they had a definitive edge.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.260]   And that's the part where I would be--
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:15.180]   I am not inclined to discourage people
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:19.660]   from investing in things where they have experience,
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:29.460]   resources, context, and also just that advantage that I
[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:33.380]   think is sometimes missing with general money managers
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:35.580]   when they're trying to beat an index.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:40.540]   Is there any truth to the idea that ultra-high net worth
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:46.820]   people have access to better investments than the rest of us?
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:47.900]   There is some truth to it.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.300]   I mean, Warren Buffett getting Goldman Preferreds
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.700]   is not something that, during the financial crisis,
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.580]   is not something that people had access to.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:57.980]   But I would say for the lion's share of people,
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:02.380]   that that may be a little bit overstated.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.180]   But that's true.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.140]   Ultra-high net worth people, especially the ones
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:07.780]   who traffic around family office worlds and so on,
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.020]   are exposed to individual deals.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:13.140]   They're exposed to private equity funds and so on.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.700]   Those people who know what they're good at
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.660]   and also know what they're not good at,
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:21.100]   they're willing to pay fees for things that they understand
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.580]   extremely well.
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:25.340]   And then I see it work best when they delegate and pay
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:28.900]   as little as possible for things that are either commoditized
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:32.420]   or provide some diversification, but they may not
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:33.980]   understand real well.
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:36.060]   David Swenson from Yale.
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:41.100]   His view is that, unless you're the ultra-high net worth,
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:44.980]   hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even a billion,
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:49.180]   that you're just not going to get quality asset management
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.500]   and that you should just index most of your portfolio.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:55.140]   How do you feel about that?
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.580]   I generally agree.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.340]   There's certainly exceptions to the rule.
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.500]   An example would be in real estate.
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.900]   For those people who understand neighborhoods
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:07.180]   and understand classes, multi-fam versus office,
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.980]   and they're really good at it and that's their thing,
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:12.460]   and investing in that or investing in a manager
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.180]   that they understand, where you're
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:17.420]   able to take advantage of scale, where
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:20.780]   you're able to take advantage of expertise,
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:24.860]   those are reserved for very big situations.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.220]   And to find them grouped together
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.100]   in situations that are really structured to raise capital
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:33.020]   as much as to provide outsized returns.
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:34.900]   I mean, everybody gets paid along the way,
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.740]   and that comes out of the investor's pocket ultimately.
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:41.100]   I'd agree with Swenson on that one.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.860]   Unless you're able to develop that deal yourself
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:48.940]   with your own expertise and your own resources in many ways,
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.380]   the sub-ultra-high net worth level,
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:55.060]   I think you just have to really look twice and think three
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.380]   times before heading into it.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:00.740]   The name of the book is called "Wealth Actually, Intelligent
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.580]   Decision-Making for the 1%."
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:04.260]   Thank you so much for being on the Bogle Heads
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:05.660]   on Investing podcast.
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:09.260]   And good luck with your new role as a director at Pendleton
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.180]   Square Trust Company.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:11.660]   Terrific.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:12.780]   Rick, thank you very much.
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.540]   And I want to say it's a pleasure to be on.
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:18.740]   You do a great service for the investing community
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.140]   and for the high net worth, ultra-high net worth,
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.540]   and beyond for those people even who are just
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:24.660]   learning about investing.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.860]   So I'm thrilled to be a part of it.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:30.980]   This concludes Bogle Heads on Investing, episode number 29.
