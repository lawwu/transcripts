[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   The following is a conversation with Harry Cliff,
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   a particle physicist at the University of Cambridge,
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.860]   working on the Large Hadron Collider Beauty Experiment
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.020]   that specializes in investigating the slight differences
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.240]   between matter and antimatter by studying a type
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.900]   of particle called the beauty quark or b quark.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.320]   In this way, he's part of the group of physicists
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.120]   who are searching for the evidence of new particles
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.940]   that can answer some of the biggest questions
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.440]   in modern physics.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.820]   He's also an exceptional communicator of science
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.860]   with some of the clearest and most captivating explanations
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.420]   of basic concepts in particle physicists
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.540]   that I've ever heard.
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.940]   So when I visited London, I knew I had to talk to him.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.900]   And we did this conversation
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.260]   at the Royal Institute Lecture Theater,
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.500]   which has hosted lectures for over two centuries
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.100]   from some of the greatest scientists
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.140]   and science communicators in history,
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.660]   from Michael Faraday to Carl Sagan.
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.080]   This conversation was recorded
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.240]   before the outbreak of the pandemic.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.440]   For everyone feeling the medical and psychological
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.440]   and financial burden of this crisis,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.360]   I'm sending love your way.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.400]   Stay strong.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.560]   We're in this together.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.160]   We'll beat this thing.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.840]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.920]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.320]   review it with five stars on Apple Podcasts,
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.540]   support it on Patreon,
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.320]   or simply connect with me on Twitter @LexFriedman,
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.080]   spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080]   As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.360]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.480]   that can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.840]   I hope that works for you
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.000]   and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.400]   Quick summary of the ads.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.960]   Two sponsors, ExpressVPN and Cash App.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.640]   Please consider supporting the podcast
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.640]   by getting ExpressVPN at expressvpn.com/lexpod
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.840]   and downloading Cash App and using code LEXPODCAST.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.760]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.160]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.360]   When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.400]   Cash App lets you send money to friends,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.520]   buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.440]   with as little as $1.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.760]   Since Cash App does fractional share trading,
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.520]   let me mention that the order execution algorithm
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.960]   that works behind the scenes
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.680]   to create the abstraction of the fractional orders
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.760]   is an algorithmic marvel.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.680]   So big props to the Cash App engineers
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.160]   for solving a hard problem that in the end
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.640]   provides an easy interface that takes a step up
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.680]   to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.520]   making trading more accessible for new investors
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.400]   and diversification much easier.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.800]   So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.160]   or Google Play and use the code LEXPODCAST,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.480]   you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to Thirst,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.920]   an organization that is helping advance robotics
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.800]   and STEM education for young people around the world.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.680]   This show is sponsored by ExpressVPN.

[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.080]   I've been using ExpressVPN for many years.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.200]   I love it.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.360]   It's easy to use.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.920]   Press the big power on button and your privacy is protected.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.360]   And if you like, you can make it look like your location
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.320]   is anywhere else in the world.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.920]   I might be in Boston now,
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.200]   but I can make it look like I'm in New York,
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.680]   London, Paris, or anywhere else.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.000]   This has a large number of obvious benefits.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.160]   Certainly, it allows you to access international versions
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.120]   of streaming websites like the Japanese Netflix
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.280]   or the UK Hulu.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.160]   ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.560]   I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu, Windows, Android,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.880]   but it's available everywhere else too.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.720]   Once again, get it at expressvpn.com/lexpod
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.320]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.960]   And now, here's my conversation with Harry Cliff.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.160]   Let's start with probably one of the coolest things
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.120]   that human beings have ever created,
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.960]   the Large Hadron Collider, LHC.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.920]   What is it?
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.160]   How does it work?
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.480]   - Okay, so it's essentially this gigantic 27 kilometer
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.360]   circumference particle accelerator.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.560]   It's this big ring.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.080]   It's buried about a hundred meters underneath the surface
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.680]   in the countryside just outside Geneva in Switzerland.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.080]   And really what it's for ultimately
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.360]   is to try to understand what are the basic building blocks
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.640]   of the universe.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.080]   So you can think of it in a way
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.520]   as like a gigantic microscope
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   and the analogy is actually fairly precise.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.480]   So-
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.080]   - Gigantic microscope.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.560]   - Effectively, except it's a microscope
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.200]   that looks at the structure of the vacuum.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.520]   - In order for this kind of thing to study particles,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.040]   which are the microscopic entities,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.400]   it has to be huge.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.240]   - Yes.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.080]   - It's a gigantic microscope.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.560]   What do you mean by studying vacuum?
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.960]   - Okay, so I mean, so particle physics as a field
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.440]   is kind of badly named in a way
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.600]   because particles are not the fundamental ingredients
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.760]   of the universe.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.920]   They're not fundamental at all.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.160]   So the things that we believe
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.320]   are the real building blocks of the universe
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.400]   are objects, invisible fluid-like objects
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.440]   called quantum fields.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.200]   So these are fields like the magnetic field
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.600]   around a magnet that exists everywhere in space.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.640]   They're always there.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.880]   In fact, actually, it's funny
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   that we're in the wrong institution
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.000]   'cause this is where the idea of the field
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.240]   was effectively invented by Michael Faraday
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.840]   doing experiments with magnets and coils of wire.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.200]   So he noticed that,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.400]   if he was very famous experiment that he did
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.280]   where he got a magnet and put it on top of it,
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.680]   a piece of paper and then sprinkled iron filings.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.600]   And he found the iron filings arranged themselves
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.440]   into these kind of loops,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.760]   which was actually mapping out
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.320]   the invisible influence of this magnetic field,
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.400]   which is the thing,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.720]   we've all experienced, we've all felt held a magnet
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.480]   or two poles of magnet and pushing together
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.600]   and felt this thing, this force pushing back.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.080]   So these are real physical objects.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.800]   And the way we think of particles in modern physics
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.640]   is that they are essentially little vibrations,
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.240]   little ripples in these otherwise invisible fields
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.400]   that are everywhere.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.240]   They fill the whole universe.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.440]   - You know, I don't, I apologize,
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.400]   perhaps for the ridiculous question.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.200]   Are you comfortable with the idea
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.120]   of the fundamental nature of our reality being fields?
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.160]   'Cause to me particles,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.560]   you know, a bunch of different building blocks
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.800]   makes more sense sort of intellectually,
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.920]   sort of visually, like it seems to,
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.600]   I seem to be able to visualize that kind of idea easier.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.160]   - Yeah. - Are you comfortable
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.720]   psychologically with the idea
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.280]   that the basic building block is not a block, but a field?
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.200]   - I think it's, I think it's quite a magical idea.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.040]   I find it quite appealing and it's,
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.000]   well, it comes from a misunderstanding
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.120]   of what particles are.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.440]   So like when you, when we do science at school
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.680]   and we draw a picture of an atom,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.320]   you draw like, you know, a nucleus
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.680]   with some protons and neutrons,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.920]   these little spheres in the middle,
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.880]   and then you have some electrons
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.800]   that are like little flies flying around the atom.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.440]   And that is a completely misleading picture
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.680]   of what an atom is like.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.520]   It's nothing like that.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.920]   The electron is not like a little planet orbiting the atom.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.840]   It's this spread out, wibbly wobbly wave-like thing.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.360]   And we know we've known that since, you know,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.080]   the early 20th century, thanks to quantum mechanics.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.160]   So when we, we carry on using this word particle
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.720]   because sometimes when we do experiments,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.880]   particles do behave like they're little marbles
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.160]   or little bullets, you know?
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.520]   So in the LHC, when we collide particles together,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.000]   you'll get, you know, you'll get like hundreds of particles
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.200]   will fly out through the detector
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.840]   and they all take a trajectory
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   and you can see from the detector where they've gone
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.320]   and they look like they're little bullets.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   So they behave that way, you know, a lot of the time.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.560]   But when you really study them carefully,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.040]   you'll see that they are not little spheres.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.160]   They are these ethereal disturbances
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.880]   in these underlying fields.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.640]   So this is really how we think nature is,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.600]   which is surprising, but also I think kind of magic.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.800]   So, you know, we are, our bodies are basically made up of
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.000]   like little knots of energy in these invisible objects
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.240]   that are all around us.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.560]   - And what is the story of the vacuum when it comes to LHC?
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.880]   So why did you mention the word vacuum?
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.400]   - Okay, so if we just, if we go back to like
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.280]   the physics we do know, so atoms are made of electrons,
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.240]   which were discovered a hundred or so years ago.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.960]   And then in the nucleus of the atom,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.680]   you have two other types of particles.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.440]   There's an up, something called an up quark
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.360]   and a down quark.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.640]   And those three particles make up every atom
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.880]   in the universe.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.640]   So we think of these as ripples in fields.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.280]   So there is something called the electron field
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.080]   and every electron in the universe is a ripple
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.040]   moving about in this electron field.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.760]   So the electron field is all around us, we can't see it,
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.880]   but every electron in our body is a little ripple
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.560]   in this thing that's there all the time.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.920]   And the quark field is the same.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   So there's an up quark field and an up quark
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.240]   is a little ripple in the up quark field
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.280]   and the down quark is a little ripple in something else
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.320]   called the down quark field.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.960]   So these fields are always there.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.840]   Now there are potentially, we know about a certain number
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.400]   of fields in what we call the standard model
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.280]   of particle physics.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.000]   And the most recent one we discovered was the Higgs field.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.040]   And the way we discovered the Higgs field
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.560]   was to make a little ripple in it.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.480]   So what the LHC did, it fired two protons into each other
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.320]   very, very hard with enough energy that you could create
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.400]   a disturbance in this Higgs field.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.800]   And that's what shows up as what we call the Higgs boson.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.920]   So this particle that everyone was going on about
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.760]   eight or so years ago is proof really,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.480]   the particle in itself is, I mean, it's interesting,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.600]   but the thing that's really interesting is the field
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.880]   because it's the Higgs field that we believe
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.240]   is the reason that electrons and quarks have mass.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.000]   And it's that invisible field that's always there
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.480]   that gives mass to the particles.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.080]   The Higgs boson is just our way of checking
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.360]   it's there basically.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.160]   - So the Large Hadron Collider,
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.640]   in order to get that ripple in the Higgs field,
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.040]   it requires a huge amount of energy, I suppose.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.000]   And so that's why you need this huge,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.360]   that's why size matters here.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.440]   So maybe there's a million questions here,
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.640]   but let's backtrack.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   Why does size matter in the context of a particle?
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.960]   Of a particle collider.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   So why does bigger allow you for higher energy collisions?
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.500]   - Right, so the reason, well, it's kind of simple really,
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.080]   which is that there are two types of particle accelerator
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.920]   that you can build.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.640]   One is circular, which is like the LHC,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.680]   the other is a great long line.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.560]   So the advantage of a circular machine
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.600]   is that you can send particles around a ring
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.560]   and you can give them a kick every time they go around.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.720]   So imagine you have a, there's actually a bit of the LHC
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.800]   that's about only 30 meters long,
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.720]   where you have a bunch of metal boxes,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.120]   which have oscillating 2 million volt
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.700]   electric fields inside them,
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.360]   which are timed so that when a proton
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.560]   goes through one of these boxes,
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.200]   the field it sees as it approaches is attractive.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.240]   And then as it leaves the box, it flips and becomes repulsive
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.460]   and the proton gets attracted and kicked out the other side.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.060]   So it gets a bit faster.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.160]   So you send it, but then you send it back around again.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.440]   - And it's incredible, like the timing of that,
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.160]   the synchronization, wait, really?
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.520]   - I think there's going to be a multiplicative effect
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.720]   on the questions I have.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.880]   Okay, let me just take that tangent for a second.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.980]   The orchestration of that,
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.040]   is that a fundamentally a hardware problem
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.600]   or a software problem?
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.120]   Like what, how do you get that?
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.680]   - I mean, I should first of all say, I'm not an engineer.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.640]   So the guys, I did not build the LHC.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.360]   So there are people much, much better at this stuff
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.260]   than I could. - For sure, but maybe.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.680]   But from your sort of intuition,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.440]   from the echoes of what you understand,
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.560]   what you heard of how it's designed, what's your sense?
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.360]   What's the engineering aspects of it?
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.400]   - The acceleration bit is not challenging.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.120]   Okay, I mean, okay, there is always challenges
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.200]   with everything, but basically you have these,
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.000]   the beams that go around the LHC,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.400]   the beams of particles are divided into little bunches.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.680]   So they're called, they're a bit like swarms of bees,
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.920]   if you like.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.880]   And there are around, I think it's something of the order
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.200]   of 2000 bunches spaced around the ring.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.760]   And they, if you're at a given point on the ring,
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.080]   counting bunches, you get 40 million bunches
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.200]   passing you every second.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.160]   So they come in like, you know,
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.920]   like cars going past in a very fast motorway.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.240]   So you need to have, if you're electric fields
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.360]   that you're using to accelerate the particles,
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.760]   that needs to be timed so that as a bunch of protons arrives,
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.040]   it's got the right sign to attract them
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.560]   and then flips at the right moment.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.560]   But I think the voltage in those boxes
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.160]   oscillates at hundreds of megahertz.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.240]   So the beams are like 40 megahertz,
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.160]   but it's oscillating much more quickly than the beam.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.600]   So I think, you know, it's difficult engineering,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.640]   but in principle, it's not, you know,
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.400]   a really serious challenge.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.240]   The bigger problem.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.520]   - There's probably engineers like screaming at you right now.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.360]   - Probably.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.200]   - Yeah.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.040]   - Well, I mean, okay.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.880]   So in terms of coming back to this thing,
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.800]   why is it so big?
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.520]   Well, the reason is you want to get the particles
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.160]   through that accelerating element over and over again.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.280]   So you want to bring them back round.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.320]   That's why it's round.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.640]   The question is why couldn't you make it smaller?
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.360]   Well, the basic answer is that these particles
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.120]   are going unbelievably quickly.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.120]   So they travel at 99.9999991% of the speed of light
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.360]   in the LHC.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.720]   And if you think about say driving your car
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.040]   round a corner at high speed,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.520]   if you go fast, you need a lot of friction in the tires
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.200]   to make sure you don't slide off the road.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   So the limiting factor is how powerful a magnet can you make
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.480]   'cause it's what we do is magnets are used
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.920]   to bend the particles around the ring.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.080]   And essentially the LHC when it was designed
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.160]   was designed with the most powerful magnets
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.880]   that could conceivably be built at the time.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.360]   And so that's your kind of limiting factor.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.760]   So if you want to make the machines smaller,
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.840]   that means a tighter bend,
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.280]   you need to have a more powerful magnet.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.200]   So it's this toss up between how strong are your magnets
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.920]   versus how big a tunnel can you afford.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.560]   The bigger the tunnel, the weaker the magnets can be.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.080]   The smaller the tunnel, the stronger they've got to be.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.640]   - Okay, so maybe can we backtrack to the standard model
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.800]   and say what kind of particles there are period
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.560]   and maybe the history of kind of assembling
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.880]   that the standard model of physics
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.360]   and then how that leads up to the hopes and dreams
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.760]   and the accomplishments of the Large Hadron Collider.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.960]   - Yeah, sure, okay.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.720]   So all of 20th century physics in like five minutes.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.560]   - Yeah, please.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.280]   - Okay, so, okay, the story really begins properly
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.040]   end of the 19th century,
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.680]   the basic view of matter is that matter is made of atoms
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.240]   and the atoms are indestructible, immutable little spheres,
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.440]   like the things we were talking about
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.560]   that don't really exist.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.240]   And there's one atom for every chemical element.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.840]   So there's an atom for hydrogen, for helium,
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.760]   for carbon, for iron, et cetera, and they're all different.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.840]   Then in 1897, experiments done
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.240]   at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge,
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.800]   which is where I'm still, where I'm based,
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.680]   showed that there are actually smaller particles
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.640]   inside the atom, which eventually became known as electrons.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.160]   These are these negatively charged things
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.800]   that go around the outside.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.040]   A few years later, Ernest Rutherford,
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.600]   very famous nuclear physicist,
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.960]   one of the pioneers of nuclear physics,
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.440]   shows that the atom has a tiny nugget in the center,
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.360]   which we call the nucleus,
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.800]   which is a positively charged object.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.840]   So then by like 1910, '11,
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.920]   we have this model of the atom that we learn in school,
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.200]   which is you've got a nucleus, electrons go around it.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.520]   Fast forward, you know, a few years,
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.400]   the nucleus, people start doing experiments
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.800]   with radioactivity where they use alpha particles
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.520]   that are spat out of radioactive elements as bullets.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.760]   And they fire them at other atoms.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.560]   And by banging things into each other,
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.200]   they see that they can knock bits out of the nucleus.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.880]   So these things come out called protons, first of all,
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.040]   which are positively charged particles,
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.800]   about 2000 times heavier than the electron.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.160]   And then 10 years later, more or less,
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.880]   a neutral particle is discovered called the neutron.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.000]   So those are the three basic building blocks of atoms.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.400]   You have protons and neutrons in the nucleus
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.680]   that are stuck together by something
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.200]   called the strong force, the strong nuclear force.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.760]   You have electrons in orbit around that
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.920]   held in by the electromagnetic force,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.440]   which is one of the forces of nature.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.840]   That's sort of where we get to by like 1932, more or less.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.440]   Then what happens is physics is nice and neat.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.760]   In 1932, everything looks great.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.380]   Got three particles and all the atoms are made of,
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.220]   that's fine.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.960]   But then cloud chamber experiments.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.020]   So these are devices that can be used to,
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.600]   the first device is capable of imaging subatomic particles.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   So you can see their tracks
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.760]   and they're used to study cosmic rays,
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.760]   particles that come from out of space
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.640]   and bang into the atmosphere.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.100]   And in these experiments,
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.840]   people start to see a whole lot of new particles.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.560]   So they discover for one thing, antimatter,
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.420]   which is the sort of a mirror image of the particles.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.960]   So we discover that there's also,
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.440]   as well as a negatively charged electron,
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.520]   there's something called a positron,
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.480]   which is a positively charged version of the electron.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.220]   And there's an antiproton, which is negatively charged.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.600]   And then a whole load of other weird particles
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.480]   start to get discovered
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.800]   and no one really knows what they are.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.960]   This is known as the zoo of particles.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   - Are these discoveries
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.120]   some of the first theoretical discoveries
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.360]   or are they discoveries in an experiment?
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.120]   So like, yeah, what's the process of discovery
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.840]   for these early sets of particles?
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.840]   - It's a mixture.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.420]   I mean, the early stuff around the atom
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.120]   is really experimentally driven.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.960]   It's not based on some theory.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.560]   It's exploration in the lab using equipment.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.880]   So it's really people just figuring out,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.320]   getting hands on with the phenomena,
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.920]   figuring out what these things are.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.520]   And the theory comes a bit later.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.840]   That's not always the case.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.440]   So in the discovery of the anti-electron, the positron,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.120]   that was predicted from quantum mechanics and relativity
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.280]   by a very clever theoretical physicist called Paul Dirac,
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.200]   who was probably the second brightest physicist
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.880]   of the 20th century apart from Einstein,
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.680]   but isn't anywhere near as well known.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.200]   So he predicted the existence of the anti-electron
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.840]   from basically a combination of the theories
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.200]   of quantum mechanics and relativity.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.360]   And it was discovered about a year
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.920]   after he made the prediction.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.120]   - What happens when an electron meets a positron?
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.640]   - They annihilate each other.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.360]   So when you bring a particle and its antiparticle together,
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.520]   they react, they just wipe each other out
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.960]   and their mass is turned into energy,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.520]   usually in the form of photons.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.440]   So you get light produced.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.920]   - So when you have that kind of situation,
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.880]   why does the universe exist at all
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.320]   if there's matter in any matter?
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.080]   - Oh God, now we're getting into the really big questions.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.440]   So, depends if you wanna go there now.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.000]   - Yeah, maybe let's go there later.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.600]   - 'Cause I mean, that is a very big question.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.720]   - Yeah, let's take it slow with the standard model.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.240]   So, okay, so there's matter and antimatter in the 30s.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.520]   So what else?
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.240]   - So matter, antimatter, and then a load of new particles
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.840]   start turning up in these cosmic ray experiments,
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.880]   first of all.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.120]   And they don't seem to be particles that make up atoms.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.080]   They're something else.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.120]   They all mostly interact with a strong nuclear force.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.520]   So they're a bit like protons and neutrons.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.280]   And by in the 1960s, in America particularly,
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.320]   but also in Europe and Russia,
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.160]   scientists started to build particle accelerators.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.800]   So these are the forerunners of the LHC.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.280]   So big ring-shaped machines that were, you know,
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.320]   hundreds of meters long,
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.720]   which in those days was enormous.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.760]   You never, you know, most physics up until that point
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.840]   had been done in labs, in universities, you know,
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.240]   with small bits of kit.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.160]   So this is a big change.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.920]   And when these accelerators are built,
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.680]   they start to find they can produce
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.160]   even more of these particles.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.480]   So I don't know the exact numbers, but by around 1960,
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.320]   there are of order 100 of these things
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.160]   that have been discovered.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.720]   And physicists are kind of tearing their hair out
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.040]   because physics is all about simplification.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.080]   And suddenly what was simple has become messy
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.240]   and complicated and everyone sort of wants to understand
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.640]   what's going on.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.000]   - As a quick kind of aside,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.600]   and probably a really dumb question,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.480]   but how is it possible to take something like a photon
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.000]   or electron and be able to control it enough,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   like to be able to do a controlled experiment
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.520]   where you collide it against something else?
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.360]   - Yeah.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.920]   - Is that, that seems like an exceptionally difficult
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.560]   engineering challenge, 'cause you mentioned vacuum too.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.200]   So you basically want to remove every other distraction
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.800]   and really focus on this collision.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.840]   How difficult of an engineering challenge is that,
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.680]   just to get a sense?
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.720]   - It is very hard.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.960]   I mean, in the early days,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   particularly when the first accelerators are being built
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.920]   in like 1932, Ernest Lawrence builds the first,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.880]   what we call a cyclotron,
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.760]   which is like a little accelerator, this big or so.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.920]   There's another one. - Literally that big?
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.520]   - This tiny little thing, yeah.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.840]   I mean, so most of the first accelerators
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.000]   were what we call fixed target experiments.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.600]   So you had a ring,
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.080]   you accelerate particles around the ring
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.480]   and then you fire them out the side into some target.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   So that makes the kind of,
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.320]   the colliding bit is relatively straightforward
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.360]   'cause you just fire it,
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.640]   whatever it is you want to fire it at.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.200]   The hard bit is the steering the beams
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.120]   with the magnetic fields,
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.560]   getting strong enough electric fields to accelerate them,
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.400]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.760]   The first colliders where you have two beams
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.680]   colliding head on, that comes later.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   And I don't think it's done until maybe the 1980s.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.200]   I'm not entirely sure, but it takes,
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.360]   it's a much harder problem.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.680]   - That's crazy 'cause you have to like perfectly
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.840]   get them to hit each other.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.120]   I mean, we're talking about, I mean, what scale,
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   what's the, I mean, the temporal thing is a giant mess,
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.160]   but the spatially, like the size, it's tiny.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.080]   - Well, to give you a sense of the LHC beams,
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.120]   the cross-sectional diameter is,
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.800]   I think, around a dozen or so microns.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.080]   So, you know, 10 millionths of a meter.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.880]   - And a beam, sorry, just to clarify,
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.320]   a beam contains how many,
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.080]   is it the bunches that you mentioned?
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   Is it multiple parts or is it just one part?
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.560]   - Oh, no, no, the bunches contain,
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.920]   say, a hundred billion protons each.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.040]   So a bunch is, it's not really bunch-shaped.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:51.880]   They're actually quite long.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.680]   They're like 30 centimeters long,
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.880]   but thinner than a human hair.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.440]   So like very, very narrow, long sort of objects.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.280]   Those are the things.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.240]   So what happens in the LHC is you steer the beams
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.080]   so that they cross in the middle of the detector.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.560]   So basically you have these swarms of protons
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.160]   that are flying through each other.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.520]   And most of that, you have, sorry,
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.080]   a hundred billion coming one way,
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.500]   a hundred billion another way,
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.080]   maybe 10 of them will hit each other.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.400]   - Oh, okay, so this, okay, that makes a lot more sense.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.240]   That's nice.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.960]   So you're trying to use sort of,
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.560]   it's like probabilistically, you're not-
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.840]   - You can't make a single particle
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.680]   collide with a single other particle.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.800]   - Yeah, so- - That's not an efficient way
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.640]   to do it.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.760]   You'd be waiting a very long time to get anything.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.160]   - Yeah, so you're basically, right,
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.520]   so you're relying on probability to be
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.800]   that some fraction of them are gonna collide.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   And then you know which,
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.320]   'cause it's a swarm of the same kind of particle.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.440]   - So it doesn't matter which ones hit each other exactly.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.240]   I mean, that's not to say it's not hard.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.400]   You've got to, one of the challenges
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.480]   to make the collisions work
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.520]   is you have to squash these beams to very, very,
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.040]   basically the narrower they are, the better,
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.800]   'cause the higher chances of them colliding.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.400]   If you think about two flocks of birds
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.600]   flying through each other,
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.680]   the birds are all far apart in the flocks.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.960]   There's not much chance that they'll collide.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.440]   If they're all flying densely together,
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.360]   then they're much more likely to collide with each other.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.040]   So that's the sort of problem.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   And it's tuning those magnetic fields,
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.400]   getting the magnetic fields powerful enough
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.240]   that you squash the beams and focus them
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.920]   so that you get enough collisions.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.920]   - That's super cool.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.360]   Do you know how much software is involved here?
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.400]   I mean, so if I come from the software world
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.600]   and it's fascinating,
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.240]   this seems like,
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.040]   it's the software's buggy and messy.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.840]   So you almost don't want to rely on software too much.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.880]   Like if you do, it has to be low level,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.280]   like Fortran style programming.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.480]   Do you know how much software
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.440]   is in a large Hadron Collider?
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.560]   - I mean, it depends at which level, a lot.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.600]   I mean, the whole thing is obviously computer controlled.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.400]   So, I mean, I don't know a huge amount
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.280]   about how the software for the actual accelerator works,
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.280]   but I've been in the control center.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.200]   So at CERN, there's this big control room,
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.400]   which is a bit like a NASA mission control
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.680]   with big banks of desks where the engineers sit
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.120]   and they monitor the LHC
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.760]   'cause you obviously can't be in the tunnel
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.360]   when it's running, so everything's remote.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.360]   I mean, one sort of anecdote about the sort of software side
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.360]   in 2008, when the LHC first switched on,
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.560]   they had this big launch event
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.840]   and then, you know, big press conference party
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.200]   to inaugurate the machine.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.240]   And about 10 days after that,
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.520]   they were doing some tests
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.000]   and this dramatic event happened
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.880]   where a huge explosion basically took place in a tunnel
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.800]   that destroyed or damaged, badly damaged
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   about half a kilometer of the machine.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.840]   But the story is,
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.520]   the engineers are in the control room that day.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.240]   One guy told me this story about, you know,
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.640]   basically all these screens they have in the control room
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.480]   started going red.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.080]   So all these alarms, like, you know,
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.240]   kind of in software going off
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.440]   and then they assumed that there's something wrong
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.440]   with the software 'cause there's no way
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.640]   something this catastrophic could have happened.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.080]   But I mean, when I worked on,
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.280]   when I was a PhD student,
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.000]   one of my jobs was to help to maintain the software
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.080]   that's used to control the detector that we work on.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.120]   And that was, it's relatively robust,
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.920]   not so, you don't want it to be too fancy.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.600]   You don't want it to sort of fall over too easily.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.000]   The more clever stuff comes
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.440]   when you're talking about analyzing the data
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.520]   and that's where the sort of, you know.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.680]   - Are we jumping around too much?
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.120]   Did we finish with the standard model?
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:13.960]   - We didn't, no.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.800]   - We didn't.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.000]   So have we even started talking about quarks?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   - We haven't talked to them yet, no.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.320]   We got to the messy zoo of particles.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.920]   - Let me, let's go back there if it's okay.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.760]   - Okay, that's fine.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.920]   - Can you take us to the rest of the history
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.680]   of physics in the 20th century?
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.520]   - Okay.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.360]   - Sure.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.960]   Okay, so circa 1960, you have this,
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.640]   you have these a hundred or so particles.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.480]   It's a bit like the periodic table all over again.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.840]   So you've got like having a hundred elements,
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.200]   sort of a bit like that.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.440]   And people start to try to impose some order.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.600]   So Murray Gelman,
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.640]   he's a theoretical physicist American from New York.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.440]   He realizes that there are these symmetries
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.400]   in these particles that if you arrange them
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   in certain ways, they relate to each other
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.080]   and he uses these symmetry principles
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.240]   to predict the existence of particles
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.240]   that haven't been discovered,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.040]   which are then discovered in accelerators.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.480]   So this starts to suggest
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.480]   there's not just random collections of crap.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.440]   There's like, you know, actually some order
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.720]   to this underlying it.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.120]   A little bit later in 1960,
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.240]   again, it's around the 1960s.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.400]   He proposes along with another physicist
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.840]   called George Zweig that these symmetries arise
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.360]   because just like the patterns in the periodic table arise
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.400]   because atoms are made of electrons and protons,
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.120]   that these patterns are due to the fact
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.240]   that these particles are made of smaller things
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.880]   and they are called quarks.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.480]   So these are the particles that predicted from theory
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.720]   for a long time, no one really believes they're real.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.400]   A lot of people think that they're a kind
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.480]   of theoretical convenience that happened to fit the data
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.560]   but there's no evidence.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.440]   No one's ever seen a quark in any experiment.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.600]   And lots of experiments are done to try to find quarks,
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.480]   to try to knock a quark out of a...
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.880]   So the idea, if protons and neutrons are made of quarks,
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.160]   you should be able to knock a quark out and see the quark.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.040]   That never happens.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.160]   And we still have never actually managed to do that.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.280]   - Wait, really?
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.120]   - No.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.240]   So the way that it's done in the end
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.640]   is this machine that's built in California
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.840]   at the Stanford Lab, Stanford Linear Accelerator,
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.520]   which is essentially a gigantic
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.480]   three kilometer long electron gun.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.280]   It fires electrons almost the speed of light at protons.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.840]   And when you do these experiments,
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.120]   what you find is at very high energy,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.000]   the electrons bounce off small hard objects
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.400]   inside the proton.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.080]   So it's a bit like taking an X-ray of the proton.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.600]   You're firing these very light, high energy particles
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.280]   and they're pinging off little things inside the proton
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.240]   that are like ball bearings, if you like.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.040]   So you actually, that way they resolve
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.040]   that there are three things inside the proton,
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.160]   which are quarks, the quarks that Gell-Mann
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.440]   and Zweig had predicted.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.840]   So that's really the evidence that convinces people
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.360]   that these things are real.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.800]   The fact that we've never seen one
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.960]   in an experiment directly,
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.200]   they're always stuck inside other particles.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.160]   And the reason for that is essentially
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.080]   to do with a strong force.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.680]   The strong force is the force that holds quarks together.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.000]   And it's so strong, it's impossible
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.440]   to actually liberate a quark.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.240]   So if you try and pull a quark out of a proton,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.680]   what actually ends up happening
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.240]   is that you kind of create this spring-like bond
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.080]   in the strong force.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.760]   You imagine two quarks that are held together
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.520]   by a very powerful spring.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.920]   You pull and pull and pull,
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.240]   more and more energy gets stored in that bond,
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.400]   like stretching a spring.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.320]   And eventually the tension gets so great,
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.680]   the spring snaps and the energy in that bond
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.640]   gets turned into two new quarks
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.400]   that go on the broken ends.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.440]   So you started with two quarks,
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.680]   you end up with four quarks.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.160]   So you never actually get to take a quark out,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.880]   you just end up making loads more quarks in the process.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.920]   - So how do we, again, forgive the dumb question,
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.880]   how do we know quarks are real then?
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.080]   - Well, A, from these experiments where we can scatter,
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.680]   you fire electrons into the protons,
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.640]   they can burrow into the proton and knock off,
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.120]   and they can bounce off these quarks.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.120]   So you can see from the angles the electrons come out.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   - I see, you can infer.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.080]   - You can infer that these things are there.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.640]   The quark model can also be used,
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.880]   it has a lot of success,
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.600]   so you can use it to predict the existence
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.760]   of new particles that hadn't been seen.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.800]   So, and it basically, there's lots of data
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.360]   basically showing from, you know,
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.220]   when we fire protons at each other at the LHC,
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.840]   a lot of quarks get knocked all over the place,
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.880]   and every time they try and escape from, say,
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.720]   one of their protons,
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.640]   they make a whole jet of quarks that go flying off,
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.600]   bound up in other sorts of particles made of quarks.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.760]   So all the sort of the theoretical predictions
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.800]   from the basic theory of the strong force and the quarks
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.420]   all agrees with what we are seeing in experiments.
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.040]   We've just never seen an actual quark on its own,
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.320]   because unfortunately it's impossible
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.180]   to get them out on their own.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:45.160]   - So quarks, these crazy smaller things
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.200]   that are hard to imagine are real.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.180]   So what else?
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.820]   What else is part of the story here?
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.120]   - So the other thing that's going on at the time,
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   around the '60s, is an attempt to understand the forces
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.240]   that make these particles interact with each other.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.800]   So you have the electromagnetic force,
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.920]   which is the force that was sort of discovered
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.160]   to some extent in this room, or at least in this building.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.000]   So the first, what we call quantum field theory
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   of the electromagnetic force is developed in the 1940s
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.280]   and '50s by Feynman, Richard Feynman,
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.000]   amongst other people, Julian Schwinger, Tomonaga,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.400]   who come up with the first, what we call
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.740]   a quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.360]   And this is where this description of,
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.360]   which I gave you at the beginning,
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.820]   that particles are ripples in fields.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.920]   Well, in this theory, the photon, the particle of light,
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.320]   is described as a ripple in this quantum field
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.720]   called the electromagnetic field.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.240]   And the attempt then is made to try,
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.260]   well, can we come up with a quantum field theory
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.440]   of the other forces, of the strong force
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.120]   and the weak, the third force, which we haven't discussed,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.760]   which is the weak force, which is a nuclear force.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.640]   We don't really experience it in our everyday lives,
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.960]   but it's responsible for radioactive decay.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.960]   It's the force that allows, you know,
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.200]   in a radioactive atom to turn into a different element,
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.040]   for example.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.360]   - And I don't know if you've explicitly mentioned,
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.040]   but so there's technically four forces.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.920]   - Yes.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.880]   - I guess three of them would be in the standard model,
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.400]   like the weak, the strong, and the electromagnetic,
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.520]   and then there's gravity.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.160]   - And there's gravity, which we don't worry about that,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.000]   'cause it's too hard.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.840]   - Who cares?
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.920]   - Maybe we bring that up at the end, but yeah.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.320]   Gravity so far, we don't have a quantum theory of,
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.520]   and if you can solve that problem,
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.080]   you'll win a Nobel Prize.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.000]   - Well, we're gonna have to bring up the graviton
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.160]   at some point, I'm gonna ask you,
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.160]   but let's leave that to the side for now.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:36.160]   So those three, okay, Feynman, electromagnetic force,
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.440]   the quantum field.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.360]   - Yeah.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.920]   - And where does the weak force come in?
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.560]   - So yeah, well, first of all,
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.760]   I mean, the strong force is the easiest.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.680]   The strong force is a little bit like
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.600]   the electromagnetic force.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.160]   It's a force that binds things together.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.040]   So that's the force that holds quarks together
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.860]   inside the proton, for example.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.160]   So a quantum field theory of that force is discovered
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.900]   in the, I think it's in the '60s,
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.260]   and it predicts the existence of new force particles
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.520]   called gluons.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.920]   So gluons are a bit like the photon.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.480]   The photon is the particle of electromagnetism.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.520]   Gluons are the particles of the strong force.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.880]   So there's, just like there's an electromagnetic field,
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.560]   there's something called a gluon field,
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.480]   which is also all around us.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.760]   - So these, some of these particles, I guess,
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.640]   are the force carriers or whatever.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.480]   They carry the-
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.960]   - Well, it depends how you wanna think about it.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.480]   I mean, really the field, the strong force field,
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.880]   the gluon field is the thing that binds the quarks together.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.440]   The gluons are the little ripples in that field.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.200]   So that like, in the same way that the photon
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.880]   is a ripple in the electromagnetic field.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.600]   But the thing that really does the binding is the field.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.400]   I mean, you may have heard people talk about things like,
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.840]   I don't know if you've heard the phrase virtual particle.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.440]   So sometimes in some, if you hear people describing
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.880]   how forces are exchanged between particles,
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.600]   they quite often talk about the idea that, you know,
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.280]   if you have an electron and another electron, say,
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.640]   and they're repelling each other
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.080]   through the electromagnetic force,
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.800]   you can think of that as if they're exchanging photons.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.680]   So they're kind of firing photons backwards and forwards
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.040]   between each other and that causes them to repel.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.080]   - That photon is then a virtual particle.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.440]   - Yes, that's what we call a virtual particle.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.560]   In other words, it's not a real thing.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.840]   It doesn't actually exist.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.920]   So it's an artifact of the way theorists do calculations.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.160]   So when they do calculations in quantum field theory,
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.440]   rather than, no one's discovered a way
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.800]   of just treating the whole field.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.200]   You have to break the field down into simpler things.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.200]   So you can basically treat the field
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.560]   as if it's made up of lots of these virtual photons,
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.680]   but there's no experiment that you can do
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.440]   that can detect these particles being exchanged.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.480]   What's really happening in reality
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.200]   is that the electromagnetic field
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.800]   is warped by the charge of the electron
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.240]   and that causes the force.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.320]   But the way we do calculations involves particles.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.840]   So it's a bit confusing,
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.300]   but it's really a mathematical technique.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.720]   It's not something that corresponds to reality.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.240]   - I mean, that's part, I guess, of the Feynman diagrams.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.080]   - Yes.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.080]   - Is this these virtual particles, okay.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.520]   - That's right, yeah.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.560]   - Some of these have mass, some of them don't.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.040]   Is that, what does that even mean, not to have mass?
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.080]   And maybe you can say,
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.840]   which one of them have mass and which don't?
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.160]   - Okay, so--
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.000]   - And why is mass important or relevant
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   in this field view of the universe?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.720]   - Well, there are actually only two particles
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.480]   in the standard model that don't have mass,
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   which are the photon and the gluons.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.280]   So they are massless particles,
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.960]   but the electron, the quarks,
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.120]   and there are a bunch of other particles
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:34.960]   that I haven't discussed.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.400]   There's something called a muon and a tau,
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.320]   which are basically heavy versions of the electron
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.160]   that are unstable.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.400]   You can make them in accelerators,
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.240]   but they don't form atoms or anything.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.640]   They don't exist for long enough.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.720]   But all the matter particles, there are 12 of them,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.980]   six quarks and six, what we call leptons,
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.480]   which includes the electron and its two heavy versions
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.960]   and three neutrinos.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.440]   All of them have mass.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.520]   And so do, this is the critical bit.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.840]   So the weak force,
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.840]   which is the third of these quantum forces,
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.240]   which is one of the hardest to understand,
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:12.840]   the force particles of that force have very large masses.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.900]   And there are three of them.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.560]   They're called the W plus, the W minus, and the Z boson.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.000]   And they have masses of between 80 and 90 times
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.560]   that of the protons.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.400]   So they're very heavy.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.240]   - Wow.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.060]   - They're very heavy things.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.440]   - So they're what, the heaviest, I guess?
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.280]   - They're not the heaviest.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.920]   The heaviest particle is the top quark,
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   which has a mass of about 175-ish protons.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.720]   So that's really massive.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.680]   And we don't know why it's so massive.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.160]   But coming back to the weak force,
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:47.380]   so the problem in the '60s and '70s was that
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.100]   the reason that the electromagnetic force
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.920]   is a force that we can experience in our everyday lives.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.240]   So if we have a magnet and a piece of metal,
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.160]   you can hold it a meter apart if it's powerful enough
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.040]   and you'll feel a force.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.400]   Whereas the weak force only becomes apparent
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.180]   when you basically have two particles touching
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.360]   at the scale of a nucleus.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.980]   So we get to very short distances
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.600]   before this force becomes manifest.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.280]   It's not, we don't get weak forces going on in this room.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.600]   We don't notice them.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.840]   And the reason for that is that the particle,
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.160]   well, the field that transmits the weak force,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.280]   the particle that's associated with that field
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.360]   has a very large mass,
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.240]   which means that the field dies off very quickly.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.360]   So as you, whereas an electric charge,
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.640]   if you were to look at the shape of the electromagnetic field
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.160]   it would fall off with this,
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.760]   you have this thing called the inverse square law,
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.200]   which is the idea that the force halves
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.740]   every time you double the distance.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.640]   No, sorry, it doesn't half, it quarters
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.560]   every time you double the distance
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.220]   between say the two particles.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.760]   Whereas the weak force kind of,
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.320]   you move a little bit away from the nucleus
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.400]   and it just disappears.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.980]   The reason for that is because these fields,
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.400]   the particles that go with them have a very large mass.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.880]   But the problem that theorists faced in the '60s
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.320]   was that if you tried to introduce massive force fields,
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.520]   the theory gave you nonsensical answers.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.680]   So you'd end up with infinite results
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.140]   for a lot of the calculations you tried to do.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.520]   So the basically, it turned out,
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.220]   it seemed that quantum field theory was incompatible
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.320]   with having massive particles.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.720]   Not just the force particles actually,
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.920]   but even the electron was a problem.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.760]   So this is where the Higgs
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.640]   that we sort of alluded to comes in.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.400]   And the solution was to say, okay, well,
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.480]   actually all the particles in the standard model are mass,
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.540]   they have no mass.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.360]   So the quarks, the electron, they don't have a mass.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.820]   Neither do these weak particles,
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.720]   they don't have mass either.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.520]   What happens is they actually acquire mass
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.420]   through another process.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.660]   They get it from somewhere else.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.780]   They don't actually have it intrinsically.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.520]   So this idea that was introduced by,
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.760]   well, Peter Higgs is the most famous,
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.400]   but actually there are about six people
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.080]   that came up with the idea more or less at the same time,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.200]   is that you introduce a new quantum field,
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.880]   which is another one of these invisible things
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.120]   that's everywhere.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.500]   And it's through the interaction with this field
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.640]   that particles get mass.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.060]   So you can think of, say, an electron in the Higgs field,
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.880]   it kind of Higgs field kind of bunches around the electron.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.840]   It's sort of drawn towards the electron.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.560]   And that energy that's stored in that field
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.680]   around the electron is what we see
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.280]   as the mass of the electron.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.700]   But if you could somehow turn off the Higgs field,
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.840]   then all the particles in nature would become massless
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.500]   and fly around at the speed of light.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   So this idea of the Higgs field allowed other people,
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.120]   other theorists to come up with a, well,
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.480]   it was another, basically a unified theory
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.520]   of the electromagnetic force and the weak force.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.040]   So once you bring in the Higgs field,
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.600]   you can combine two of the forces into one.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.860]   So it turns out the electromagnetic force
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.600]   and the weak force are just two aspects
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.380]   of the same fundamental force.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.720]   And at the LHC, we go to high enough energies
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.440]   that you see these two forces unifying effectively.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:04.200]   - So first of all, it started as a theoretical notion,
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.080]   like this is something, and then,
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.880]   I mean, wasn't the Higgs called the god particle
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.720]   at some point?
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.640]   - It was by a guy trying to sell popular science books, yeah.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.400]   - Yeah, but I mean, I remember,
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.880]   'cause when I was hearing it,
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.040]   I thought it would, I mean, that would solve a lot of,
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.400]   that unify a lot of our ideas of physics,
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.320]   is what was my notion.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.040]   But maybe you can speak to that.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.800]   Is it as big of a leap?
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.160]   Is it a god particle, or is it a Jesus particle?
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.280]   (laughing)
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.000]   Which, you know, what's the big contribution of Higgs
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.800]   in terms of this unification power?
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.560]   - Yeah, I mean, to understand that,
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.080]   it maybe helps to know the history a little bit.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.760]   So when the, what we call electroweak theory
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.600]   is put together, which is where you unify electromagnetism
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.280]   with the weak force, and Higgs is involved in all of that.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.440]   So that theory, which was written in the mid '70s,
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.360]   predicted the existence of four new particles,
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.760]   the W plus boson, the W minus boson,
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.480]   the Z boson, and the Higgs boson.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.760]   So there were these four particles
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.000]   that came with the theory,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.440]   that were predicted by the theory.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:12.360]   In 1983, '84, the Ws and the Z particles were discovered
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.280]   at an accelerator at CERN,
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.960]   called the super proton synchrotron,
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.200]   which was a seven kilometer particle collider.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.760]   So three of the bits of this theory had already been found.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.520]   So people were pretty confident from the '80s
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.000]   that the Higgs must exist,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.760]   because it was a part of this family of particles
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.000]   that this theoretical structure only works
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.440]   if the Higgs is there.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.560]   So what then happens,
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.120]   and so you have this question about why is the LHC
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.400]   the size it is? - Yes.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.480]   - Well, actually the tunnel that the LHC is in
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.800]   was not built for the LHC.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.120]   It was built for a previous accelerator
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.720]   called the large electron positron collider.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   So that began operation in the late '80s, early '90s.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.240]   They basically, that's when they dug
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.440]   the 27 kilometer tunnel.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.000]   They put this accelerator into it,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.720]   the collider that fires electrons and anti electrons
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.640]   at each other, electrons and positrons.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.160]   So the purpose of that machine was,
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.680]   well, it was actually to look for the Higgs.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   That was one of the things it was trying to do.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.400]   It didn't have enough energy to do it in the end.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.840]   But the main thing it achieved was it studied
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.560]   the W and the Z particles at very high precision.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.280]   So it made loads of these things.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.560]   Previously you could only make a few of them
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.440]   at the previous accelerator.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.480]   So you could study these really, really precisely.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.680]   And by studying their properties,
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.200]   you could really test this electroweak theory
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.800]   that had been invented in the '70s
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.280]   and really make sure that it worked.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.280]   So actually by 1999, when this machine turned off,
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.480]   people knew, well, okay, you never know
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.400]   until you find the thing.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.000]   But people were really confident
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.840]   that this electroweak theory was right.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.840]   And that the Higgs almost,
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.880]   the Higgs or something very like the Higgs had to exist
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.280]   because otherwise the whole thing doesn't work.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.040]   It'd be really weird if you could discover
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.920]   and these particles, they all behave exactly
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.360]   as your theory tells you they should.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.920]   But somehow this key piece of the picture is not there.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.960]   So in a way, it depends how you look at it.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.840]   The discovery of the Higgs on its own
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.040]   is obviously a huge achievement in many,
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.360]   both experimentally and theoretically.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.240]   On the other hand, it's like having a jigsaw puzzle
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.080]   where every piece has been filled in.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.000]   You have this beautiful image, there's one gap
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.240]   and you kind of know that piece must be there somewhere.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.080]   - Yeah. - Right.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.960]   So the discovery in itself, although it's important,
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.400]   is not so interesting.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.360]   - It's like a confirmation of the obvious at that point.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.040]   - But what makes it interesting
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.080]   is not that it just completes the standard model,
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.960]   which is a theory that we've known
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.760]   had the basic layout of for 40 years or more now.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.400]   It's that the Higgs actually is a unique particle.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.520]   It's very different to any of the other particles
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.840]   in the standard model.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.240]   And it's a theoretically very troublesome particle.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.200]   There are a lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs,
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.800]   but also opportunities.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.520]   So that we basically, we don't really understand
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.200]   how such an object can exist in the form that it does.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.440]   So there are lots of reasons for thinking
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.520]   that the Higgs must come with a bunch of other particles
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.000]   or that it's perhaps made of other things.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.400]   So it's not a fundamental particle
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.880]   that it's made of smaller things.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.520]   I can talk about that if you like a bit.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.920]   - That's still a notion.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.760]   So the Higgs might not be a fundamental particle,
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.160]   that there might be some, oh man.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.360]   - So that is an idea.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.040]   It's not been demonstrated to be true.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.800]   But I mean, all of these ideas basically come
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.520]   from the fact that this is a problem that motivated
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.320]   a lot of development in physics in the last 30 years or so.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.720]   And it's this basic fact that the Higgs field,
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.240]   which is this field that's everywhere in the universe,
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.000]   this is the thing that gives mass to the particles.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.160]   And the Higgs field is different
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.080]   from all the other fields in that,
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.360]   let's say you take the electromagnetic field,
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.040]   which is, if we actually were to measure
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.360]   the electromagnetic field in this room,
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.840]   we would measure all kinds of stuff going on
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.920]   'cause there's light, there's gonna be microwaves
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.080]   and radio waves and stuff.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.920]   But let's say we could go to a really, really remote part
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.680]   of empty space and shield it and put a big box around it
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.080]   and then measure the electromagnetic field in that box.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.200]   The field would be almost zero,
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.800]   apart from some little quantum fluctuations,
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.960]   but basically it goes to naught.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.160]   The Higgs field has a value everywhere.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.680]   So it's a bit like the whole,
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.440]   it's like the entire space has got this energy
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.440]   stored in the Higgs field, which is not zero,
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.960]   it's finite, it's got some,
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.920]   it's a bit like having the temperature of space raised
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.360]   to some background temperature.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:36.880]   And it's that energy that gives mass to the particles.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.440]   So the reason that electrons and quarks have mass
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   is through the interaction with this energy
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.800]   that's stored in the Higgs field.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:49.800]   Now, it turns out that the precise value this energy has
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:55.600]   has to be very carefully tuned if you want a universe
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.140]   where interesting stuff can happen.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.660]   So if you push the Higgs field down,
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.040]   it has a tendency to collapse to,
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.000]   well, there's a tendency,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.640]   if you do your sort of naive calculations,
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.280]   there are basically two possible likely configurations
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.320]   for the Higgs field, which is either it's zero everywhere,
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.480]   in which case you have a universe
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.840]   which is just particles with no mass that can't form atoms
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.040]   and just fly about at the speed of light,
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.700]   or it explodes to an enormous value,
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.800]   what we call the Planck scale,
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.160]   which is the scale of quantum gravity.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.060]   And at that point, if the Higgs field was that strong,
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.900]   even an electron would become so massive
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.200]   that it would collapse into a black hole.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.080]   And then you have a universe made of black holes
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.940]   and nothing like us.
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.640]   So it seems that the strength of the Higgs field
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.160]   is to achieve the value that we see
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.920]   requires what we call fine tuning of the laws of physics.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.340]   You have to fiddle around with the other fields
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.320]   in the standard model and their properties
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.760]   to just get it to this right sort of Goldilocks value
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.120]   that allows atoms to exist.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.580]   This is deeply fishy.
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:57.400]   People really dislike this.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   - Well, yeah, I guess, so what would be,
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.840]   so two explanations.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.040]   One, there's a God that designed this perfectly,
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.560]   and two is there's an infinite number
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.680]   of alternate universes, and we just happen
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.120]   to be in the one in which life is possible.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.360]   - Yeah, yeah. - Complexity.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.540]   So when you say, I mean, life, any kind of complexity,
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.920]   that's not either complete chaos or black holes.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.760]   - I mean, how does that make you feel?
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.600]   What do you make of that?
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.280]   That's such a fascinating notion
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.360]   that this perfectly tuned field
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.120]   that's the same everywhere is there.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.160]   What do you make of that?
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.200]   Yeah, what do you make of that?
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.320]   - I mean, yeah, so you laid out
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.680]   two of the possible explanations.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.920]   - Really? - Somewhat.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.520]   Yeah, I mean, well, someone,
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.160]   some cosmic creator went, yeah, let's fix that
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.160]   to be at the right level.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.420]   That's one possibility, I guess.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:45.880]   It's not a scientifically testable one,
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.720]   but theoretically, I guess it's possible.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.880]   - Sorry to interrupt, but there could also be
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.480]   not a designer, but couldn't there be just,
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.960]   I guess I'm not sure what that would be,
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.220]   but some kind of force that,
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:04.240]   some kind of mechanism by which
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:09.880]   this kind of field is enforced
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.960]   in order to create complexity,
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.320]   basically forces that pull the universe
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.800]   towards an interesting complexity.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.400]   - I mean, yeah, I mean, there are people
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.320]   who have those ideas.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.640]   I don't really subscribe to them.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.560]   - As I'm saying, it sounds really stupid.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.160]   - No, I mean, there are definitely people
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.440]   that make those kind of arguments.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.040]   There's ideas that, I think it's Lee Smolin's idea,
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:38.040]   one, I think, that universes are born inside black holes.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.320]   And so universes, they basically have
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.520]   like Darwinian evolution of the universe
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.840]   where universes give birth to other universes.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.760]   And if universes where black holes can form
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.800]   are more likely to give birth to more universes,
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.280]   so you end up with universes which have similar laws.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.480]   I mean, I don't know, whatever.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.080]   - But I talked to Lee recently on this podcast
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:02.080]   and he's a reminder to me that the physics community
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.600]   has like so many interesting characters.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.960]   It's fascinating.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.800]   Anyway, sorry, so.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.040]   - I mean, as an experimentalist,
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.200]   I tend to sort of think, these are interesting ideas,
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.760]   but they're not really testable.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.720]   So I tend not to think about them very much.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.580]   So, I mean, going back to the science of this,
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.120]   there is an explanation.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.240]   There is a possible solution to this problem of the Higgs,
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.160]   which doesn't involve multiverses
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.560]   or creators fiddling about with the laws of physics.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.400]   If the most popular solution
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.440]   was something called supersymmetry,
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.760]   which is a theory which involves
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.720]   a new type of symmetry of the universe.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.680]   In fact, it's one of the last types of symmetries
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.560]   that is possible to have
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.400]   that we haven't already seen in nature,
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.600]   which is a symmetry between force particles
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.760]   and matter particles.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.480]   So what we call fermions,
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.880]   which are the matter particles
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.920]   and bosons, which are force particles.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.120]   And if you have supersymmetry,
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.520]   then there is a super partner for every particle
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.920]   in the standard model.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.520]   And without going into the details,
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.980]   the effect of this basically is that
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.320]   you have a whole bunch of other fields,
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.760]   and these fields cancel out
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.680]   the effect of the standard model fields,
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.840]   and they stabilize the Higgs field
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.000]   at a nice sensible value.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.360]   So in supersymmetry, you naturally,
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.880]   without any tinkering about
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.160]   with the constants of nature or anything,
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.360]   you get a Higgs field with a nice value,
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.960]   which is the one we see.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.200]   So this is one of the reasons,
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.600]   and supersymmetry has also got lots
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   of other things going for it.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.360]   It predicts the existence of a dark matter particle,
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.000]   which would be great.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.120]   It potentially suggests that the strong force
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.740]   and the electroweak force unify at high energy.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:33.800]   So lots of reasons people thought
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.320]   this was a productive idea.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.800]   And when the LHC was, just before it was turned on,
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.600]   there was a lot of hype, I guess,
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.440]   a lot of an expectation that we would discover
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.280]   these super partners, because,
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.080]   and particularly the main reason was
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.240]   that if supersymmetry stabilizes the Higgs field
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.960]   at this nice Goldilocks value,
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.760]   these super particles should have a mass
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.520]   around the energy that we're probing at the LHC,
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.920]   around the energy of the Higgs.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.520]   So it was kind of thought, you discover the Higgs,
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.640]   you probably discover super partners as well.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.200]   - So once you start creating ripples in this Higgs field,
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.680]   you should be able to see these kinds of,
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.520]   you should be, yeah.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.000]   - So these super fields would be there.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.320]   When at the very beginning I said
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.720]   we're probing the vacuum,
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.280]   what I mean is really that,
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.680]   okay, let's say these super fields exist.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.200]   The vacuum contains super fields,
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.160]   they're there, these supersymmetric fields.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.640]   If we hit them hard enough, we can make them vibrate.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.840]   We see super particles come flying out.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.280]   That's the sort of, that's the idea.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.120]   - That's the whole, okay.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.160]   - That's the whole point.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.680]   - But we haven't.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.520]   - But we haven't.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.040]   So, so far at least, I mean, we've had now
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.920]   a decade of data taking at the LHC.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.440]   No signs of super partners,
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.320]   have supersymmetric particles have been found.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.120]   In fact, no signs of any physics,
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.680]   any new particles beyond the standard model
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.520]   have been found.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.480]   So supersymmetry is not the only thing that can do this.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.400]   There are other theories that involve
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.120]   additional dimensions of space
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.640]   or potentially involve the Higgs boson
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.880]   being made of smaller things,
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.320]   being made of other particles.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.400]   - Yeah, that's an interesting,
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.520]   I haven't heard that before.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.440]   That's really, that's an interesting point.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.600]   Could you maybe linger on that?
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.360]   Like what, what could be,
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.840]   what could the Higgs particle be made of?
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.120]   - Well, so the oldest,
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.520]   I think the original ideas about this
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.040]   was these theories called technicolor,
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.320]   which were basically like an analogy
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.280]   with the strong force.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.560]   So the idea was the Higgs boson
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.480]   was a bound state of two
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.440]   very strongly interacting particles
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.520]   that were a bit like quarks.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.160]   So like quarks, but I guess higher energy things
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.360]   with a super strong force.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.200]   So not the strong force,
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.960]   but a new force that was very strong.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.440]   And the Higgs was a bound state of these, these objects.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.400]   And the Higgs would in principle, if that was right,
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.760]   would be the first in a series of
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.360]   technicolor particles.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.520]   Technicolor, I think, not being a theorist,
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.080]   but it's not, it's basically not done very well,
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.560]   particularly since the LHC found the Higgs,
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.320]   that kind of, it rules out, you know,
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.440]   a lot of these technicolor theories.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.280]   But there are other things
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.400]   that are a bit like technicolor.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   So there's a theory called partial compositeness,
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.520]   which is an idea that some of my colleagues
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.320]   at Cambridge have worked on,
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.360]   which is a similar sort of idea
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.160]   that the Higgs is a bound state
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.400]   of some strongly interacting particles.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.960]   And that the standard model particles themselves,
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.080]   the more exotic ones like the top quark
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:20.440]   are also sort of mixtures of these composite particles.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.280]   So it's a kind of an extension to the standard model,
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:27.000]   which explains this problem with the Higgs bosons,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.720]   Goldilocks value, but also helps us understand.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.800]   We have, we're in a situation now, again,
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.680]   a bit like the periodic table where we have six quarks,
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.600]   six leptons in this kind of,
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.960]   you can arrange in this nice table
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.320]   and there you can see these columns
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.640]   where the patterns repeat and you go,
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:47.600]   "Okay, maybe there's something deeper going on here."
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.560]   And so this would potentially be something
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:52.800]   this partial compositeness theory could explain,
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.280]   sort of enlarge this picture
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.400]   that allows us to see the whole symmetrical pattern
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.040]   and understand what the ingredients, why do we have,
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.080]   so one of the big questions in particle physics is,
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.160]   why are there three copies of the matter particles?
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.880]   So in what we call the first generation,
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.840]   which is what we're made of,
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.680]   there's the electron, the electron neutrino,
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.080]   the up quark and the down quark,
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.560]   they're the most common matter particles in the universe,
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.680]   but then there are copies of these four particles
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.280]   in the second and the third generations.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.040]   So things like muons and top quarks and other stuff,
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.160]   we don't know why, we see these patterns,
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.360]   we have no idea where it comes from.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.800]   So that's another big question,
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.920]   can we find out the deeper order
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.160]   that explains this particular periodic table
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.360]   of particles that we see?
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.280]   - Is it possible that the deeper order
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.360]   includes like almost a single entity?
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.920]   So like something that I guess like string theory
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:49.920]   dreams about, is this essentially the dream?
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.120]   Is to discover something simple, beautiful and unifying?
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.600]   - Yeah, I mean, that is the dream.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.480]   And I think for some people, for a lot of people,
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.400]   it still is the dream.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.800]   So there's a great book by Steven Weinberg,
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.760]   who is one of the theoretical physicists
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.360]   who was instrumental in building the standard model.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:12.000]   So he came up with some others with the electroweak theory,
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.920]   the theory that unified electromagnetism
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.760]   and the weak force.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.680]   And he wrote this book,
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.080]   I think it was towards the end of the 80s, early 90s,
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.000]   called "Dreams of a Final Theory,"
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.920]   which is a very lovely, quite short book
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.200]   about this idea of a final unifying theory
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.560]   that brings everything together.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.440]   And I think you get a sense reading his book
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.760]   written at the end of the 80s, early 90s,
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:35.600]   that there was this feeling that such a theory was coming.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:39.160]   And that was the time when string theory
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.200]   had been, was very exciting.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.680]   So string theory, there's been this thing
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.080]   called the super string revolution
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.120]   and theoretical physics getting very excited.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.960]   They discovered these theoretical objects,
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.480]   these little vibrating loops of string that in principle,
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.440]   not only was a quantum theory of gravity,
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.840]   but could explain all the particles in the standard model
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:55.760]   and bring it all together.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.520]   And as you say, you have one object, the string,
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.560]   and you can pluck it and the way it vibrates
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.840]   gives you these different notes,
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.960]   each of which is a different particle.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.160]   So it's a very lovely idea.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.920]   But the problem is that, well, there's a few,
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.680]   people discover that mathematics is very difficult.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.640]   So people have spent three decades or more
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.120]   trying to understand string theory.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.400]   And I think, you know,
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.520]   if you spoke to most string theorists,
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.640]   they would probably freely admit
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.920]   that no one really knows what string theory is yet.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.000]   I mean, there's been a lot of work,
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.320]   but it's not really understood.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:31.240]   And the other problem is that string theory
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.040]   mostly makes predictions about physics
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.560]   that occurs at energies far beyond
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:40.600]   what we will ever be able to probe in the laboratory.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.200]   Yeah, probably ever.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.840]   - By the way, so sorry, take a million tangents,
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:48.080]   but is there room for complete innovation
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.200]   of how to build a particle collider
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.760]   that could give us an order of magnitude increase
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.200]   in the kind of energies,
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.520]   or do we need to keep just increasing the size of things?
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.440]   - I mean, maybe, yeah.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.920]   I mean, there are ideas,
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.920]   to give you a sense of the gulf that has to be bridged.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:08.920]   So the LHC collides particles at an energy
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:13.440]   of what we call 14 tera electron volts.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.040]   So that's basically the equivalent
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:19.200]   of you've accelerated a proton through 14 trillion volts.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.160]   That gets us to the energies where the Higgs
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.240]   and these weak particles live.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.480]   They're very massive.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.760]   The scale where strings become manifest
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.320]   is something called the Planck scale,
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.960]   which I think is of the order 10 to the,
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.700]   hang on, get this right,
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:35.840]   is 10 to the 18 giga electron volts.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:40.840]   So about 10 to the 15 tera electron volts.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:44.800]   So you're talking trillions of times more energy.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:48.760]   - Yeah, 10 to the 15, or 10 to the 14th larger.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.880]   - I may be wrong, but it's of that order.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:52.720]   It's a very big number.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.440]   So we're not talking just an order
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:55.640]   of magnitude increase in energy.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.640]   We're talking 14 orders of magnitude energy increase.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.200]   So to give you a sense of what that would look like,
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.000]   were you to build a particle accelerator
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.780]   with today's technology.
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:07.520]   - Bigger or smaller than our solar system.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.160]   - As the size of the galaxy.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.080]   - The galaxy.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.520]   - So you need to put a particle accelerator
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.600]   that circled the Milky Way to get to the energies
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.640]   where you would see strings if they exist.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.400]   So that is a fundamental problem,
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.480]   which is that most of the predictions of the unified,
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:26.080]   these unified theories, quantum theories of gravity,
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.680]   only make statements that are testable
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.200]   at energies that we will not be able to probe.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.240]   And barring some unbelievable,
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.200]   completely unexpected technological
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.120]   or scientific breakthrough,
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.000]   which is almost impossible to imagine.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.840]   You never say never, but it seems very unlikely.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.160]   - Yeah, I can just see the news story.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.880]   Elon Musk decides to build a particle collider
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.600]   the size of our--
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.840]   - It would have to be, we'd have to get together
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:55.160]   with all our galactic neighbors to pay for it, I think.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.760]   - What is the exciting possibilities
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.000]   of the Large Hadron Collider?
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.680]   What is there to be discovered
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.200]   in this order of magnitude of scale?
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.920]   Is there other bigger efforts on the horizon?
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.600]   In this space, what are the open problems,
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.760]   exciting possibilities?
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.600]   You mentioned supersymmetry.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:17.600]   - Yeah, so well, there are lots of new ideas.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:18.960]   Well, there are lots of problems that we're facing.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.160]   So there's a problem with the Higgs field,
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.320]   which supersymmetry was supposed to solve.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.720]   There's the fact that 95% of the universe
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.360]   we know from cosmology, astrophysics is invisible,
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.840]   that it's made of dark matter and dark energy,
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.040]   which are really just words for things
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.360]   that we don't know what they are.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.920]   It's what Donald Rumsfeld called a known unknown.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.880]   So we know we don't know what they are.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.480]   - Well, that's better than unknown unknown.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.800]   - Yeah, well, there may be some unknown unknowns,
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.200]   but by definition, we don't know what those are.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.360]   So yeah.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:52.360]   - But the hope is a particle accelerator
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.560]   could help us make sense of dark energy, dark matter.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.680]   There's still some hope for that?
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.760]   - There's hope for that, yeah.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:01.400]   So one of the hopes is the LHC could produce
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.800]   a dark matter particle in its collisions.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:08.800]   And it may be that the LHC will still discover new particles,
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.320]   that supersymmetry could still be there.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:14.360]   It's just maybe more difficult to find
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.640]   than we thought originally.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.560]   And dark matter particles might be being produced,
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.400]   but we're just not looking
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.200]   in the right part of the data for them.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.160]   That's possible.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.360]   It might be that we need more data,
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.840]   that these processes are very rare
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.640]   and we need to collect lots and lots of data
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:27.640]   before we see them.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.880]   But I think a lot of people would say now
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:33.760]   that the chances of the LHC
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.040]   directly discovering new particles
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.840]   in the near future is quite slim.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.840]   It may be that we need a decade more data
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.960]   before we can see something, or we may not see anything.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.520]   That's where we are.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:49.040]   So I mean, the physics, the experiments that I work on,
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.840]   so I work on a detector called LHCb,
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.840]   which is one of these four big detectors
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.440]   that are spaced around the ring.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:57.600]   And we do slightly different stuff to the big guys.
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.680]   There's two big experiments called Atlas and CMS,
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.800]   3,000 physicists and scientists
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.840]   and computer scientists on them each.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.160]   They are the ones that discovered the Higgs
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.640]   and they look for supersymmetry in dark matter and so on.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.240]   What we look at are standard model particles
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.920]   called bquarks, which depending on your preferences,
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.640]   either bottom or beauty, we tend to say beauty
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.880]   'cause it sounds sexier.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.520]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.760]   - But these particles are interesting
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.880]   because we can make lots of them.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.920]   We make billions or hundreds of billions of these things.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.600]   You can therefore measure their properties very precisely.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.440]   So you can make these really lovely precision measurements.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:39.440]   And what we are doing really is a sort of complimentary thing
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.960]   to the other big experiments, which is,
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.160]   if you think of the sort of analogy they often use is,
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.840]   if you imagine you're in the jungle
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.720]   and you're looking for an elephant, say,
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.080]   and you are a hunter and you're kind of like,
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.560]   let's say there's the elephant's very rare,
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.480]   you don't know where in the jungle, the jungle's big.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.800]   So there's two ways you go about this.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.760]   Either you can go wandering around the jungle
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.240]   and try and find the elephant.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.120]   The problem is if there's only one elephant
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:02.960]   and the jungle's big,
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.760]   the chances of running into it are very small.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.200]   Or you could look on the ground
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.200]   and see if you see footprints left by the elephant.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.840]   And if the elephant's moving around,
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:11.680]   you've got a chance,
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.880]   you've got a chance maybe of seeing the elephant's footprints
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.080]   if you see the footprints, you go, okay, there's an elephant.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.320]   I maybe don't know what kind of elephant it is,
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.000]   but I got a sense there's something out there.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.600]   So that's sort of what we do.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.040]   We are the footprint people.
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.800]   We are, we're looking for the footprints,
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.800]   the impressions that quantum fields
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.600]   that we haven't managed to directly create the particle of,
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.960]   the effects these quantum fields have
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.560]   on the ordinary standard model fields
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.480]   that we already know about.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.000]   So these B particles,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.280]   the way they behave can be influenced by the presence
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.840]   of say super fields or dark matter fields
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.160]   or whatever you like.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.600]   And the way they decay and behave can be altered slightly
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.920]   from what our theory tells us they ought to behave.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.760]   - Gotcha.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.600]   And it's easier to collect huge amounts of data
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.560]   on B quarks.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.440]   - We get billions and billions of these things.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.280]   You can make very precise measurements.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.160]   And the only place really at the LHC
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.160]   or in really in high energy physics at the moment
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.880]   where there's fairly compelling evidence
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.920]   that there might be something beyond the standard model
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.320]   is in these B, these beauty quarks decays.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.040]   - Just to clarify,
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.440]   which is the difference between the different,
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.600]   the four experiments, for example, that you mentioned,
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.760]   is it the kind of particles that are being collided?
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.160]   Is it the energies of which they're collided?
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.960]   What's the fundamental difference
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.440]   between the different experiments?
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.280]   - The collisions are the same.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.480]   What's different is the design of the detectors.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.040]   So Atlas and CMS are called,
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.760]   they're called what are called general purpose detectors.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.400]   And they are basically barrel shaped machines.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.440]   And the collisions happen in the middle of the barrel.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.600]   And the barrel captures all the particles
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.040]   that go flying out in every direction.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.840]   So in a sphere effectively, they come flying out
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.840]   and it can record all of those particles.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.800]   And-
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.720]   - What's the, sorry to be interrupting,
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.480]   but what's the mechanism of the recording?
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.680]   - Oh, so these detectors,
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.160]   if you've seen pictures of them, they're huge.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.200]   Like Atlas is 25 meters high and 45 meters long.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.460]   They're vast machines,
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.640]   instruments, I guess you should call them really.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.800]   They are, they're kind of like onions.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.400]   So they have layers, concentric layers of detectors,
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.520]   different sorts of detectors.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.200]   So close into the beam pipe,
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.640]   you have what are called usually made of silicon,
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.760]   they're tracking detectors.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.640]   So they're little, made of strips of silicon
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.000]   or pixels of silicon.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.800]   And when a particle goes through the silicon,
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.520]   it gives a little electrical signal
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.480]   and you get these dots, you know,
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.000]   electrical dots through your detector,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.160]   which allows you to reconstruct
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.120]   the trajectory of the particle.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:34.960]   So that's the middle.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.280]   And then the outsides of these detectors,
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.720]   you have things called calorimeters,
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.600]   which measure the energies of the particles.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.440]   And then very edge,
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.640]   you have things called muon chambers,
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.680]   which basically these muon particles,
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.720]   which are the heavy version of the electron,
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.440]   they are like high velocity bullets
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.120]   and they can get right to the edge of the detectors.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.480]   If you see something at the edge, that's a muon.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.000]   So that's broadly how they work.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.720]   - And all of that is being recorded.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.280]   - That's all being fed out to, you know, computers.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.840]   - Data must be awesome.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.800]   Okay.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.000]   - So LHCb is different.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.680]   So we, because we're looking for these b-quarks,
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.960]   b-quarks tend to be produced along the beam line.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.160]   So in a collision,
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.840]   the b-quark tend to fly sort of close to the beam pipe.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.800]   So we built a detector that sort of pyramid,
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.120]   cone shaped basically, that just looks in one direction.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.280]   So we ignore, if you have your collision,
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.120]   stuff goes everywhere.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.400]   We ignore all the stuff over here and going off sideways.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.200]   We're just looking in this little region
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.080]   close to the beam pipe
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.720]   where most of these b-quarks are made.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.720]   So.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:34.160]   - Is there a different aspect of the sensors involved
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.600]   in the collection of the b-quark trajectories?
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.720]   - There are some differences.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.840]   So one of the differences is that
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.600]   one of the ways you know you've seen a b-quark
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.880]   is that b-quarks are actually quite long lived
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.960]   by particle standards.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.120]   So they live for 1.5 trillionths of a second,
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.600]   which is if you're a fundamental particle
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.640]   is a very long time.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.480]   'Cause you know, the Higgs boson,
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.720]   I think lives for about a trillionth of a trillionth
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.520]   of a second, or maybe even less than that.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.840]   So these are quite long lived things
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.680]   and they will actually fly a little distance
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.520]   before they decay.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.200]   So they will fly, you know, a few centimeters,
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.000]   maybe if you're lucky, then they'll decay into other stuff.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.440]   So what we need to do in the middle of the detector,
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.240]   you wanna be able to see,
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.640]   you have your place where the protons crash into each other
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.960]   and that produces loads of particles that come flying out.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.160]   So you have loads of lines,
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.360]   loads of tracks that point back to that proton collision.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.440]   And then you're looking for a couple of other tracks,
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.920]   maybe two or three that point back to a different place
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.400]   that's maybe a few centimeters away
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.440]   from the proton collision.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.880]   And that's the sign that little b particle
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.280]   has flown a few centimeters and decayed somewhere else.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.800]   So we need to be able to very accurately resolve
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.520]   the proton collision from the b particle decay.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.400]   So we are, the middle of our detector is very sensitive
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.200]   and it gets very close to the collision.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.480]   So you have this really beautiful, delicate silicon detector
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.400]   that sits, I think it's seven mil millimeters from the beam.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.680]   And the LHC beam has as much energy as a jumbo jet
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.520]   at takeoff.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.320]   So it's enough to melt a ton of copper.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.880]   So you have this furiously powerful thing sitting next
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.360]   to this tiny, delicate, you know, silicon sensor.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.160]   So those aspects of our detector that are specialized
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.840]   to measure these particular b quarks
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.880]   that we're interested in.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.960]   - And is there, I mean, I remember seeing somewhere
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.360]   that there's some mention of matter and antimatter
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.280]   connected to the b, these beautiful quarks.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.640]   Is that, what's the connection?
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.880]   Yeah, what's the connection there?
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.200]   - Yeah, so there is a connection,
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:31.840]   which is that when you produce these b particles,
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.760]   these particles, 'cause you don't see the b quark,
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.440]   you see the thing that b quark is inside.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.000]   So they're bound up inside what we call beauty particles,
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.640]   where the b quark is joined together with another quark
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.400]   or two, maybe two other quarks, depending on what it is.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:46.200]   There are a particular set of these b particles
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.520]   that exhibit this property called oscillation.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.320]   So if you make a, for the sake of argument,
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.480]   a matter version of one of these b particles,
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.880]   as it travels, because of the magic of quantum mechanics,
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.040]   it oscillates backwards and forwards
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.880]   between its matter and antimatter versions.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.760]   So it does this weird flipping about backwards and forwards.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.200]   And what we can use this for is a laboratory
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.920]   for testing the symmetry between matter and antimatter.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.720]   So if the symmetry between antimatter is precise,
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:20.080]   it's exact, then we should see these b particles decaying
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.880]   as often as matter as they do as antimatter,
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.360]   'cause this oscillation should be even.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.040]   It should spend as much time in each state.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.000]   But what we actually see is that one of the states
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.240]   it spends more time in,
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.840]   it's more likely to decay in one state than the other.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:37.000]   So this gives us a way of testing this fundamental symmetry
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.200]   between matter and antimatter.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.120]   - So what can you, sort of returning to the question
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.480]   we were before about this fundamental symmetry,
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.520]   it seems like if there's perfect symmetry
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.560]   between matter and antimatter,
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:54.600]   if we have the equal amount of each in our universe,
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.000]   it would just destroy itself.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.760]   And just like you mentioned,
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.920]   we seem to live in a very unlikely universe
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.520]   where it doesn't destroy itself.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:07.280]   So do you have some intuition about why that is?
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.160]   - I mean, well, I'm not a theorist.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.720]   I don't have any particular ideas myself.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.160]   I mean, I sort of do measurements
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.200]   to try and test these things.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.040]   But I mean, so in terms of the basic problem
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.840]   is that in the Big Bang,
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:18.800]   if you use the standard model
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.160]   to figure out what ought to have happened,
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.720]   you should have got equal amounts of matter
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.560]   and antimatter made.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.920]   'Cause whenever you make a particle,
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.440]   in our collisions, for example,
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.840]   when we collide stuff together,
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.440]   you make a particle, you make an antiparticle.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.480]   They always come together.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.920]   They always annihilate together.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.480]   So there's no way of making more matter than antimatter
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.040]   that we've discovered so far.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.080]   So that means in the Big Bang,
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.240]   you get equal amounts of matter and antimatter.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.400]   As the universe expands and cools down
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.760]   during the Big Bang,
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.240]   not very long after the Big Bang,
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.040]   I think a few seconds after the Big Bang,
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.280]   you have this event called the Great Annihilation,
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.840]   which is where all the particles and antiparticles
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.040]   smack into each other,
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.520]   annihilate, turn into light mostly,
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.000]   and you end up with a universe later on.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.960]   If that was what happened,
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.080]   then the universe we live in today
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.800]   would be black and empty,
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.600]   apart from some photons, that would be it.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.520]   So there's stuff in the,
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.560]   there is stuff in the universe.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.960]   It appears to be just made of matter.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.920]   So there's this big mystery as to where the,
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.200]   how did this happen?
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.640]   And there are various ideas
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.520]   which all involve sort of physics going on
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:17.040]   in the first trillionth of a second or so of the Big Bang.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.080]   So it could be that one possibility
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.600]   is that the Higgs field is somehow implicated in this,
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.320]   that there was this event that took place
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.320]   in the early universe
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.640]   where the Higgs field basically switched on.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.400]   It acquired its modern value.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.480]   And when that happened,
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.600]   this caused all the particles to acquire mass.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.880]   And the universe basically went through a phase transition
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.000]   where you had a hot plasma of massless particles.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.040]   And then in that plasma,
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.800]   it's almost like a gas turning into droplets of water.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.960]   You get kind of these little bubbles forming in the universe
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.800]   where the Higgs field has acquired its modern value.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.280]   The particles have got mass.
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.200]   And this phase transition in some models
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.920]   can cause more matter than antimatter to be produced
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.600]   depending on how matter bounces off these bubbles
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.720]   in the early universe.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.760]   So that's one idea.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.640]   There's other ideas to do with neutrinos,
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.360]   that there are exotic types of neutrinos
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.280]   that can decay in a biased way to just matter
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.160]   and not to antimatter.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.600]   So people are trying to test these ideas.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.280]   That's what we're trying to do at LHCb.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.720]   There's neutrino experiments planned
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.520]   that are trying to do these sorts of things as well.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.960]   So yeah, there are ideas,
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.920]   but at the moment no clear evidence
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.880]   for which of these ideas might be right.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.480]   - So we're talking about some incredible ideas.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.280]   By the way, never heard anyone be so eloquent
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.680]   about describing even just the standard model.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.520]   So I'm in awe just listening.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.360]   - Oh, thank you.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.060]   - Interesting, just having fun enjoying it.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.240]   So yes, the theoretical,
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.480]   the particle physics is fascinating here.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.640]   To me, one of the most fascinating things
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.840]   about the Large Hadron Collider is the human side of it,
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.480]   that a bunch of sort of brilliant people
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.320]   that probably have egos got together
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.260]   and were collaborating together.
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:59.120]   And countries, I guess, collaborated together
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.160]   for the funds and everything.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.960]   Just collaboration everywhere.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.980]   'Cause you may be,
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.820]   I don't know what the right question here to ask,
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:10.720]   but what's your intuition about how it's possible
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.800]   to make this happen?
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.320]   And what are the lessons we should learn
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.040]   for the future of human civilization
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.820]   in terms of our scientific progress?
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:21.580]   'Cause it seems like this is a great, great illustration
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.620]   of us working together to do something big.
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.020]   - Yeah, I think it's possibly the best example,
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:30.260]   maybe I can think of, of international collaboration
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:33.500]   that isn't for some unpleasant purpose, basically.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:38.460]   I mean, so when I started out in the field in 2008
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.420]   as a new PhD student, the LHC was basically finished.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.540]   So I didn't have to go around asking for money for it
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:45.460]   or trying to make the case.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.620]   So I have huge admiration for the people
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:48.700]   who managed that.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:51.100]   'Cause this was a project that was first imagined
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:51.940]   in the 1970s.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.700]   In the late '70s was when the first conversations
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:56.380]   about the LHC were mooted.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:00.740]   And it took two and a half decades of campaigning
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:03.540]   and fundraising and persuasion
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.940]   until they started breaking ground and building the thing
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.980]   in the early noughties and 2000.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.540]   So, I mean, I think the reason,
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:14.060]   just from the point of view of the scientists there,
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.660]   I think the reason it works ultimately
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.380]   is that everyone there is there for the same reason,
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:23.660]   which is, well, in principle at least,
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:25.500]   they're there because they're interested in the world.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.660]   They wanna find out what are the basic ingredients
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:29.500]   of our universe?
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.020]   What are the laws of nature?
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.940]   And so everyone is pulling in the same direction.
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.020]   Of course, everyone has their own things
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:35.860]   they're interested in.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:37.380]   Everyone has their own careers to consider.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.580]   And I wouldn't pretend that there isn't also
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:40.860]   a lot of competitions.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.900]   There's this funny thing in these experiments
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:46.140]   where your collaborators, your 800 collaborators in LHCb,
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:48.860]   but you're also competitors because your academics
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:49.940]   in your various universities,
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.500]   and you wanna be the one that gets the paper out
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.420]   on the most exciting new measurements.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.700]   So there's this funny thing where you're kind of trying
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.460]   to stake out your territory while also collaborating
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:00.900]   and having to work together to make the experiments work.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.060]   And it does work amazingly well, actually,
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.140]   considering all of that.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.780]   And I think there was actually,
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.660]   I think McKinsey or one of these big management
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:11.820]   consultancy firms went into CERN maybe a decade or so ago
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:15.020]   to try to understand how these organizations function.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.100]   - Did they figure it out?
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:16.940]   - I don't think they could.
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.780]   I mean, I think one of the things that's interesting,
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.740]   one of the other interesting things about these experiments
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.500]   is they're big operations.
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.980]   Like say Atlas has 3000 people.
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:27.340]   Now there was a person nominally who is the head of Atlas.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:29.700]   They're called the spokesperson.
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:32.380]   And the spokesperson is elected by,
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:34.260]   usually by the collaboration,
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.420]   but they have no actual power, really.
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.540]   I mean, they can't fire anyone.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:39.700]   They're not anyone's boss.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:43.340]   So, you know, my boss is a professor at Cambridge,
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.140]   not the head of my experiments.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:47.540]   The head of my experiment can't tell me what to do really.
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.220]   And there's all these independent academics
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.420]   who are their own bosses who, you know,
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.580]   so that somehow it nonetheless,
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:58.540]   by kind of consensus and discussion and lots of meetings,
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.660]   these things do happen and it does get done.
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:04.940]   - It's like the queen here in the UK is the spokesperson.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:05.780]   - I guess so.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:06.620]   - No actual power.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:07.460]   - Except we don't elect her, no.
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.900]   - No, we don't elect her.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.500]   But everybody seems to love her.
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:13.300]   I don't know, from my outside perspective.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:16.300]   (inhales)
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:19.900]   But yeah, giant egos, brilliant people.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.980]   And moving forward, do you think there's-
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.860]   - Actually, I would pick up one thing you said just there,
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:25.900]   just the brilliant people thing.
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.300]   'Cause I'm not saying that people aren't great.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.620]   But I think there is this sort of impression
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:33.020]   that physicists will have to be brilliant or geniuses,
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.100]   which is not true actually.
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.580]   And, you know, you have to be relatively bright for sure.
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.220]   But, you know, a lot of people,
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.620]   a lot of the most successful experimental physicists
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:44.020]   are not necessarily the people with the biggest brains.
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.700]   They're the people who, you know,
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.460]   particularly one of the skills that's most important
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:50.100]   in particle physics is the ability to work with others
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.420]   and to collaborate and exchange ideas and also to work hard.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:55.620]   And it's a sort of, often it's more a determination
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.580]   or a sort of other set of skills.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.220]   It's not just being, you know, kind of some great brain.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.500]   (laughs)
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.340]   - Very true.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:04.220]   So, I mean, there's parallels to that
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.220]   in the machine learning world.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:08.300]   If you wanna solve any real world problems,
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:11.220]   which I see as the particle accelerators,
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:14.980]   essentially a real world instantiation
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.820]   of theoretical physics.
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:20.340]   And for that, you have to not necessarily be brilliant,
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:25.340]   but be sort of obsessed, systematic, rigorous,
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.740]   sort of unboreable, stubborn,
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:31.200]   all those kind of qualities that make for a great engineer.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.260]   So, scientists purely speaking,
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.260]   that practitioner of the scientific method.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:37.460]   So, you're right.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.860]   But nevertheless, to me, that's brilliant.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.700]   My dad's a physicist.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:43.080]   I argue with him all the time.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.060]   To me, engineering is the highest form of science.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:48.420]   And he thinks that's all nonsense,
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.820]   that the real work is done by the theoretician.
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:55.100]   In fact, we have arguments about like people like Elon Musk,
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:58.700]   for example, because I think his work is quite brilliant,
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:00.560]   but he's fundamentally not coming up
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.500]   with any serious breakthroughs.
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:07.140]   He's just creating in this world, implementing,
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.700]   like making ideas happen that have a huge impact.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:12.260]   To me, that's the Edison.
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:17.460]   That to me is a brilliant work,
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:22.460]   but to him, it's messy details
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.660]   that somebody will figure out anyway.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.700]   - I mean, I don't know whether you think
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:29.060]   there is a actual difference in temperament
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:31.220]   between say a physicist and an engineer,
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.060]   whether it's just what you got interested in.
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.260]   I don't know.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.940]   I mean, 'cause a lot of what experimental physicists do
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:40.060]   is to some extent engineering.
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:40.900]   I mean, it's not what I do.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.180]   I mostly do data stuff, but you know,
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:45.540]   a lot of people would be called electrical engineers,
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:46.980]   but they trained as physicists,
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:48.900]   but they learned electrical engineering, for example,
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:50.980]   because they were building detectors.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.940]   So there's not such a clear divide, I think.
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:53.780]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:56.260]   I mean, but there does seem to be like,
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:57.140]   you work with data.
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.940]   There does seem to be a certain,
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:01.700]   like I love data collection.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.740]   There may be an OCD element or something
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:06.620]   that you're more naturally predisposed to
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:07.660]   as opposed to theory.
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:08.940]   Like I'm not afraid of data.
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.220]   I love data.
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.740]   And there's a lot of people in machine learning
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.420]   who are more like,
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:16.980]   they're basically afraid of data collection,
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.940]   afraid of data sets, afraid of all of that.
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.780]   They just wanna stay in more than theoretical
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:22.820]   and they're really good at it space.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.100]   So I don't know if that's the genetic,
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:28.340]   that's your upbringing, the way you go to school,
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:33.340]   but looking into the future of LHC and other colliders.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:35.820]   So there's in America, there's the,
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:37.580]   whatever it was called, the super,
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:38.420]   there's a lot of super--
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.860]   - Superconducting super collider.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.700]   - Yeah, superconducting--
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:41.900]   - The desertron, yeah.
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:43.020]   - Desertron.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.980]   So that was canceled, the construction of that,
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:50.900]   which is a sad thing.
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:54.180]   But what do you think is the future of these efforts?
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:56.500]   Will a bigger collider be built?
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.580]   Will LHC be expanded?
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:17:59.980]   What do you think?
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:01.980]   - Well, in the near future,
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:03.380]   the LHC is gonna get an upgrade.
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:04.860]   So that's pretty much confirmed.
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.340]   I think it is confirmed,
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:08.180]   which is, it's not an energy upgrade.
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:10.220]   It's what we call a luminosity upgrade.
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:13.380]   So it basically means increasing the data collection rates.
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.900]   So more collisions per second, basically,
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.180]   because after a few years of data taking,
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:19.580]   you get this law of diminishing returns
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:20.700]   where each year's worth of data
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:21.980]   is a smaller and smaller fraction
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.460]   of the lot you've already got.
[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:25.820]   So to get a real improvement in sensitivity,
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:28.300]   you need to increase the data rate by an order of magnitude.
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.500]   So that's what this upgrade is gonna do.
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:31.980]   LHC-B at the moment,
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:34.620]   the whole detector is basically being rebuilt
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:36.180]   to allow it to record data
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:37.940]   at a much larger rate than we could before.
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:39.220]   So that will make us sensitive
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:40.620]   to whole loads of new processes
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:42.140]   that we weren't able to study before.
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:45.700]   And I mentioned briefly these anomalies that we've seen.
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:49.020]   So we've seen a bunch of very intriguing anomalies
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.380]   in these B quark decays,
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:55.460]   which may be hinting at the first signs
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:56.900]   of this kind of the elephant,
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.580]   the signs of some new quantum field
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:01.140]   or fields maybe beyond the standard model.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:02.900]   It's not yet at the statistical threshold
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:06.180]   where you can say that you've observed something,
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.820]   but there's lots of anomalies in many measurements
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:11.020]   that all seem to be consistent with each other.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:11.980]   So it's quite interesting.
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:13.580]   So the upgrade will allow us
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.820]   to really home in on these things
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:17.340]   and see whether these anomalies are real,
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.460]   because if they are real,
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:20.860]   and this kind of connects to your point
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:23.700]   about the next generation of machines,
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:26.300]   what we would have seen then is,
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.260]   we would have seen the tail end of some quantum field
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:31.780]   in influencing these B quarks.
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:34.540]   What we then need to do is to build a bigger collider
[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:37.500]   to actually make the particle of that field.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:40.260]   So if these things really do exist.
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:41.260]   So that would be one argument.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.380]   I mean, so at the moment,
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.020]   Europe has going through this process
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:47.780]   of thinking about the strategy for the future.
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:49.700]   So there are a number of different proposals on the table.
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:53.620]   One is for a sort of higher energy upgrade of the LHC,
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.300]   where you just build more powerful magnets
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:56.220]   and put them in the same tunnel.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:59.660]   That's a sort of cheaper, less ambitious possibility.
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:00.820]   Most people don't really like it
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:02.580]   because it's sort of a bit of a dead end,
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:05.580]   because once you've done that, there's nowhere to go.
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.860]   There's a machine called CLIC,
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.980]   which is a compact linear collider,
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.740]   which is an electron positron collider
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:13.460]   that uses a novel type of acceleration technology
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.540]   to accelerate at shorter distances.
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.020]   We're still talking kilometers long,
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.900]   but not like a hundred kilometers long.
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.820]   And then probably the project
[01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:23.900]   that is I think getting the most support,
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.420]   it'd be interesting to see what happens,
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:28.060]   something called the Future Circular Collider,
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.780]   which is a really ambitious long-term,
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.580]   multi-decade project to build
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:35.980]   a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:38.180]   under the Geneva region.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:40.740]   The LHC would become a kind of feeding machine.
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:41.580]   It would just feed-
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:44.060]   - So the same area, so there would be a feeder for the-
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:45.580]   - Yeah, so it would kind of,
[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:47.660]   the edge of this machine would be where the LHC is,
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:49.140]   but it would sort of go under Lake Geneva
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.940]   and round to the Alps basically,
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.940]   since up to the edge of the Geneva Basin.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.100]   So it's basically the biggest,
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:56.380]   it's the biggest tunnel you can fit in the region
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:57.220]   based on the geology.
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:58.900]   - 100 kilometers, wow. - Yeah, so it's big.
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.580]   It'd be a long drive if you're,
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:01.860]   you know, you make experiments on one side,
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.100]   you've got to go back to CERN for lunch,
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:04.140]   so that would be a pain.
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:07.580]   But, you know, so this project is,
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.140]   in principle, is actually two accelerators.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:09.940]   The first thing you would do
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:11.740]   is put an electron positron machine
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:14.340]   in the 100 kilometer tunnel to study the Higgs.
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:15.580]   So you'd make lots of Higgs bosons,
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.420]   study it really precisely in the hope
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:18.620]   that you see it misbehaving
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:20.500]   and doing something it's not supposed to.
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.860]   And then in the much longer term,
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:24.820]   a hundred, that machine gets taken out,
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:26.500]   you put in a proton-proton machine.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.060]   So it's like the LHC, but much bigger.
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:30.460]   And that's the way you start going
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:32.420]   and looking for dark matter,
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:35.940]   or you're trying to recreate this phase transition
[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:37.100]   that I talked about in the early universe,
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.740]   where you can see matter-antimatter being made, for example.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.100]   So lots of things you can do with these machines.
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:44.460]   The problem is that they will take, you know,
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.700]   the most optimistic, you're not gonna have any data
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.060]   from any of these machines until 2040,
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:51.820]   or, you know, 'cause they take such a long time to build
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:52.900]   and they're so expensive.
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:55.940]   So you have, there'll be a process of R&D design,
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:57.940]   but also the political case being made.
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:01.260]   - So LHC, what cost, a few billion?
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.180]   - Depends how you count it.
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:05.420]   I think most of the sort of more reasonable estimates
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.980]   that take everything into account properly,
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:10.380]   it's around the sort of 10, 11, 12 billion Euro mark.
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:13.180]   - What would be the future, sorry, I forgot the name already.
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.700]   - Future Circular Collider.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.540]   - Future Circular Collider.
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:16.900]   - Presumably they won't call it that when it's built,
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:18.260]   'cause it won't be the future anymore,
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.620]   but I don't know what they'll call it then.
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:23.420]   (both laughing)
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:25.060]   Very big Hadron Collider, I don't know.
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:28.780]   But that will, I don't know, I should know the numbers,
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:31.100]   but I think the whole project is estimated
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:32.820]   at about 30 billion Euros,
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:37.780]   but that's money spent over between now and 2070 probably,
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:40.540]   which is when the last bit of it would be
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.300]   sort of finishing up, I guess.
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:46.500]   So you're talking a half a century of science
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.660]   coming out of this thing, shared by many countries.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:51.140]   So the actual cost, the arguments that are made
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:53.060]   is that you could make this project fit
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:56.100]   within the existing budget of CERN,
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.420]   if you didn't do anything else.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.500]   - And CERN, by the way, we didn't mention, what is CERN?
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:03.260]   - CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:05.220]   It's an international organization
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:07.060]   that was established in the 1950s
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:10.260]   in the wake of the Second World War as a kind of,
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.460]   it was sort of like a scientific Marshall Plan for Europe.
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:16.060]   The idea was that you bring European science back together
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.300]   for peaceful purposes,
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:19.740]   because what happened in the '40s was,
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:21.220]   you know, a lot of, particularly a lot of Jewish scientists,
[01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:22.580]   but a lot of scientists from Central Europe
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.940]   had fled to the United States,
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:27.220]   and Europe had sort of seen this brain drain.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.860]   So there was a desire to bring the community back together
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.220]   for a project that wasn't building nasty bombs,
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:34.220]   but was doing something that was curiosity-driven.
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.260]   So, and that has continued since then.
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:38.780]   So it's kind of a unique organization.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.420]   It's, to be a member as a country,
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:42.980]   you sort of sign up as a member,
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:45.900]   and then you have to pay a fraction of your GDP
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.260]   each year as a subscription.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.460]   I mean, it's a very small fraction, relatively speaking.
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:51.420]   I think it's like, I think the UK's contribution
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:54.980]   is 100 or 200 million quid or something like that a year,
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:57.380]   which is quite a lot, but not-
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.300]   - That's fascinating.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:23:59.980]   I mean, just the whole thing that is possible,
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:01.140]   it's beautiful.
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:02.140]   It's a beautiful idea,
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:05.220]   especially when there's no wars on the line.
[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.460]   It's not like we're freaking out.
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.780]   It's we're actually legitimately collaborating
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:09.780]   to do good science.
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:11.780]   One of the things I don't think we really mentioned
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:15.260]   is on the final side, that sort of the data analysis side,
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:17.020]   is there breakthroughs possible there
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.060]   in the machine learning side?
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:22.620]   Like, is there a lot more signal to be mined
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:25.340]   in more effective ways from the actual raw data?
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:27.260]   - Yeah, a lot of people are looking into that.
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:31.540]   I mean, so I use machine learning in my data analysis,
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:33.780]   but pretty naughty, basic stuff,
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:35.380]   'cause I'm not a machine learning expert.
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:37.900]   I'm just a physicist who had to learn to do this stuff
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:38.740]   for my day job.
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.540]   So what a lot of people do is they use
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:43.620]   kind of off the shelf packages that you can train
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:46.140]   to do signal noise-
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.780]   - Just clean up all the data.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.940]   - Yeah, but one of the big challenges is,
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:52.620]   the big challenge of the data is A, it's volume.
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:53.780]   There's huge amounts of data.
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:56.420]   So the LHC generates, now, okay,
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:57.860]   I try to remember what the actual numbers are,
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.420]   but if we don't record all our data,
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:02.180]   we record a tiny fraction of the data.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:05.220]   It's like of order one 10,000th or something, I think.
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:06.060]   Is that right?
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:06.980]   Around that.
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:08.540]   So most of it gets thrown away.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:10.060]   You couldn't record all the LHC data
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.460]   'cause it would fill up every computer in the world
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.620]   in a matter of days, basically.
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:16.940]   So there's this process that happens on live
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.820]   on the detector, something called a trigger,
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:21.300]   which in real time, 40 million times every second,
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.660]   has to make a decision about whether this collision
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.380]   is likely to contain an interesting object
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:28.540]   like a Higgs boson or a dark matter particle.
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.780]   And it has to do that very fast.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:33.220]   And the software algorithms in the past
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:35.820]   were quite relatively basic.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.820]   You know, they did things like measure momentas
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.300]   and energies of particles and put some requirements.
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.180]   So you would say, if there's a particle
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.620]   with an energy above some threshold,
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:44.820]   then record this collision.
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.220]   But if there isn't, don't.
[01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.740]   Whereas now the attempt is to get more
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:51.060]   and more machine learning in at the earliest possible stage.
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:53.140]   - That's cool, at the stage of deciding
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:55.260]   whether we wanna keep this data or not.
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:57.580]   - But also even maybe even lower down than that,
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:01.140]   which is the point where there's this,
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:02.780]   so generally how the data is reconstructed
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:06.220]   is you start off with a set of digital hits
[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:07.060]   in your detector.
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.780]   So channels saying, did you see something?
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:10.060]   Did you not see something?
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.540]   That has to be then turned into tracks,
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.060]   particles going in different directions.
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:15.540]   And that's done by using fits
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.180]   that fit through the data points.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.140]   And then that's passed to the algorithms that then go,
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.500]   is this interesting or not?
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.540]   What'd be better is you could train in machine learning
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:24.140]   to just look at the raw hits,
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:26.380]   the basic, real base level information,
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:28.420]   not have any of the reconstruction done.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:29.660]   And it just goes,
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:31.060]   and it can learn to do pattern recognition
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:34.260]   on this strange three-dimensional image that you get.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.780]   And potentially that's where you could get really big gains
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.740]   because our triggers tend to be quite inefficient
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:41.220]   because they don't have time
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:43.380]   to do the full whiz bang processing
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:45.380]   to get all the information out that we would like
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:46.740]   because you have to do the decision very quickly.
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:47.580]   So if you can come up
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:50.060]   with some clever machine learning technique,
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.020]   then potentially you can massively increase
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.980]   the amount of useful data you record
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:59.820]   and get rid of more of the background earlier in the process.
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:01.420]   - Yeah, to me, that's an exciting possibility
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:03.660]   'cause then you don't have to build a,
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:07.180]   sort of you can get a gain without having to,
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:10.340]   without having to build any hardware, I suppose.
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:11.180]   - Hardware, yeah.
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:13.980]   - Although you need lots of new GPU farms, I guess.
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.300]   - So hardware still helps.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:20.300]   But the, you know, I got to talk to you.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.860]   Sort of, I'm not sure how to ask,
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:27.500]   but you're clearly an incredible science communicator.
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.580]   I don't know if that's the right term,
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:32.580]   but you're basically a younger Neil deGrasse Tyson
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.220]   with a British accent.
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:38.580]   So, and you've, I mean, can you say where we are today?
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:39.420]   Actually?
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:42.620]   - Yeah, so today we're in the Royal Institution in London,
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:45.900]   which is an old, a very old organization.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:47.780]   It's been around for about 200 years now, I think.
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:49.620]   Maybe even I should know when it was founded,
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:51.500]   but sort of early 19th century.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.900]   It was set up to basically communicate science to the public.
[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:57.620]   So it was one of the first places in the world
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:00.060]   where scientists, famous scientists would come
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.260]   and give talks.
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:05.460]   So very famously, Humphry Davy, who you may know of,
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:07.580]   who was the person who discovered nitrous oxide,
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:11.220]   he was a very famous chemist and scientist,
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:12.740]   also discovered electrolysis.
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.940]   So he used to do these fantastic,
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:15.060]   he was a very charismatic speaker.
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.860]   So he used to appear here, there's a big desk
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.460]   that they usually have in the theater,
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:21.660]   and he would do demonstrations to the sort of the folk
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:23.780]   of London back in the early 19th century.
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.220]   And Michael Faraday, who I talked about,
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:27.300]   who was the person who did so much work on electromagnetism,
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:28.420]   he lectured here.
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:29.900]   He also did experiments in the basement.
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.260]   So this place has got a long history
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:33.940]   of both scientific research, but also-
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:34.940]   - And the communication. - Communication
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:35.780]   of scientific research.
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:39.340]   - So you gave a few lectures here, how many, two?
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:41.100]   - I've given, yeah, I've given a couple of lectures
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:42.300]   in this theater before, so.
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.860]   - I mean, that's, so people should definitely
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.160]   go watch online.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.660]   It's just the explanation of particle physics,
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:50.500]   so all the, I mean, it's incredible.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:53.380]   Like your lectures are just incredible.
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:54.540]   I can't sing it enough praise.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:55.500]   So it was awesome.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:29:00.340]   But maybe, can you say, what did that feel like?
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:03.620]   What does it feel like to lecture here, to talk about that?
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:06.460]   And maybe from a different perspective,
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.900]   more kind of like how the sausage is made,
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.140]   is how do you prepare for that kind of thing?
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:14.360]   How do you think about communication,
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.500]   the process of communicating these ideas
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:19.780]   in a way that's inspiring to what I would say
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:22.600]   your talks are inspiring to, like, the general audience.
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.140]   You don't actually have to be a scientist.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:28.100]   You can still be inspired without really knowing much.
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:30.760]   You start from the very basics.
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:33.380]   So what's the preparation process?
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:34.860]   And then the romantic question is,
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:38.020]   what did that feel like to perform here?
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:39.620]   - I mean, the profession, yeah.
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:42.260]   I mean, the process, I mean, the talk,
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:43.340]   my favorite talk that I gave here
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:44.540]   was one called "Beyond the Higgs,"
[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:46.300]   which you can find on the Royal Institution's
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.300]   YouTube channel, which you should go and check out.
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.020]   I mean, and their channel's got loads of great talks
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:51.740]   from loads of great people as well.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:55.180]   I mean, that one, I'd sort of given a version of it
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:57.380]   many times, so part of it is just practice, right?
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:59.040]   And actually, I don't have some great theory
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.420]   of how to communicate with people.
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:02.660]   It's more just that I'm really interested
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:05.300]   and excited by those ideas, and I like talking about them.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.340]   And through the process of doing that,
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:09.700]   I guess I figured out stories that work
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:10.540]   and explanations that work.
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:12.940]   - When you say practice, you mean legitimately
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.340]   just giving- - Just giving talks.
[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:16.020]   - Just giving talks. - I started off, you know,
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:18.460]   when I was a PhD student, doing talks in schools,
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:20.660]   and I still do that as well some of the time,
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:23.220]   and doing things, I've even done a bit of stand-up comedy,
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.260]   which was sort of, went reasonably well,
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:26.300]   even if it was terrifying.
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:27.540]   - That's on YouTube as well.
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:29.260]   - That's also on, I wouldn't necessarily recommend
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:30.100]   you check that out.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.220]   (laughing)
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:33.220]   I'm gonna post the links several places
[01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.020]   to make sure people click on it.
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:37.380]   - Yeah, but it's basically, I kind of have a story
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:41.140]   in my head, and I kind of, I have to think about
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:42.540]   what I wanna say, usually have some images
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:44.420]   to support what I'm saying, and I get up and do it.
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:47.220]   And it's not really, I wish there was some kind of,
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:48.660]   I probably should have some proper process.
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.060]   This probably sounds like I'm just making it up
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:52.220]   as I go along, and I sort of am.
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:54.260]   - Oh, I think the fundamental thing that you said,
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:58.300]   I think, it's like, I don't know if you know
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.100]   who a guy named Joe Rogan is.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.220]   - Yes, I do, yeah.
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:05.020]   - So he's also kind of sounds like you in a sense
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:08.620]   that he's not very introspective about his process,
[01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:13.020]   but he's an incredibly engaging conversationalist.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:15.820]   And I think one of the things that you and him share
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:19.940]   that I could see is like a genuine curiosity
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:22.340]   and passion for the topic.
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:26.860]   I think that could be systematically cultivated.
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:28.220]   I'm sure there's a process to it,
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.540]   but you come to it naturally somehow.
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.940]   I think maybe there's something else as well,
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:34.260]   which is to understand something.
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:35.940]   There's this quote by Feynman, which I really like,
[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:38.260]   which is, "What I cannot create, I do not understand."
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:43.260]   So like, I'm not particularly super bright.
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:44.740]   So for me to understand something,
[01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:47.260]   I have to break it down into its simplest elements.
[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:49.820]   And if I can then tell people about that,
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.140]   that helps me understand it as well.
[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:54.580]   So I've actually, I've learned to understand physics
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:57.180]   a lot more from the process of communicating,
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.660]   'cause it forces you to really scrutinize the ideas
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:01.500]   that you're communicating.
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:02.620]   And it quite often makes you realize
[01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:06.020]   you don't really understand the ideas you're talking about.
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:08.140]   And I'm writing a book at the moment.
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:09.980]   I had this experience yesterday where I realized
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.620]   I didn't really understand a pretty fundamental
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:14.500]   theoretical aspect of my own subject.
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.620]   And I had to go and I had to sort of spend a couple of days
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:18.860]   reading textbooks and thinking about it
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:21.780]   in order to make sure that the explanation I gave
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:24.860]   captured the, got as close to what is actually happening
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:26.060]   in the theory.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.060]   And to do that, you have to really understand it properly.
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:30.780]   - Yeah, and there's layers to understanding.
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:33.740]   Like it seems like the more,
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.940]   there must be some kind of Feynman law.
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:39.700]   I mean, the more you understand sort of the simply,
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:44.700]   you're able to really convey the essence of the idea, right?
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:51.100]   So it's like this reverse effect that it's like,
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:54.900]   the more you understand the simpler the final thing
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.300]   that you actually convey.
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.820]   And so the more accessible somehow it becomes.
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:01.960]   That's why Feynman's lectures are really accessible.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.900]   It was just counterintuitive.
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.740]   - Yeah, although there are some ideas
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:09.460]   that are very difficult to explain
[01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:12.260]   no matter how well or badly you understand them.
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:15.300]   Like I still can't really properly explain
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.420]   the Higgs mechanism.
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:19.900]   Because some of these ideas only exist in mathematics,
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:24.340]   really, and the only way to really develop an understanding
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:29.100]   is to go unfortunately into a graduate degree in physics.
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.920]   But you can get kind of a flavor of what's happening,
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:33.540]   I think, and it's trying to do that in a way
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:36.820]   that isn't misleading, but also intelligible.
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:41.220]   - So let me ask them the romantic question of what to you
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:44.500]   is the most, perhaps an unfair question.
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.580]   What is the most beautiful idea in physics?
[01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:52.660]   One that fills you with awe, is the most surprising,
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.740]   the strangest, the weirdest.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:57.580]   There's a lot of different definitions of beauty.
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:59.340]   And I'm sure there's several for you,
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:01.100]   but is there something that just jumps to mind
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:06.100]   that you think is just especially beautiful?
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:08.780]   - There's a specific thing and a more general thing.
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:10.060]   So maybe the specific thing first,
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:12.380]   which when I first came across this as an undergraduate,
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.460]   I found this amazing.
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:17.140]   So this idea that the forces of nature,
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:19.980]   electromagnetism's strong force, the weak force,
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:24.740]   they arise in our theories as a consequence of symmetries.
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:27.460]   So symmetries in the laws of nature,
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:28.980]   in the equations essentially,
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:31.020]   that used to describe these ideas.
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:34.420]   The process whereby theories come up
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:36.580]   with these sorts of models is they say,
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:39.940]   imagine the universe obeys this particular type of symmetry.
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.240]   It's a symmetry that isn't so far removed
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.860]   from a geometrical symmetry, like the rotations of a cube.
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:46.380]   It's not, you can't think of it quite that way,
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:49.020]   but it's sort of a similar sort of idea.
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:51.860]   And you say, okay, if the universe respects this symmetry,
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:54.700]   you find that you have to introduce a force
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:57.940]   which has the properties of electromagnetism.
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:00.020]   Or a different symmetry, you get the strong force,
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:01.780]   or a different symmetry, you get the weak force.
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:05.100]   So these interactions seem to come from some deeper,
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:06.240]   it suggests that they come
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.940]   from some deeper symmetry principle.
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:09.640]   I mean, depends a bit how you look at it,
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:10.700]   'cause it could be that we're actually
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:12.780]   just recognizing symmetries in the things that we see,
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:15.100]   but there's something rather lovely about that.
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.340]   But I mean, I suppose a bigger thing
[01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:18.720]   that makes me wonder is actually,
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.180]   if you look at the laws of nature,
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:22.660]   how particles interact when you get really close down,
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:24.220]   they're basically pretty simple things.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:26.340]   They bounce off each other by exchanging
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:27.840]   through force fields, and they move around
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.300]   in very simple ways.
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.900]   And somehow, these basic ingredients,
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:34.540]   these few particles that we know about in the forces,
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:37.380]   creates this universe which is unbelievably complicated
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.500]   and has things like you and me in it,
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:43.420]   and the Earth and stars that make matter in their cores
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:46.140]   from the gravitational energy of their own bulk
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.580]   that then gets sprayed into the universe
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:48.480]   that forms other things.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:52.900]   I mean, the fact that there's this incredibly long story
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:55.900]   that goes right back to the beginning,
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:57.340]   we can take this story right back
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:59.420]   to a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang,
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.260]   and we can trace the origins of the stuff
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:02.420]   that we're made from.
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:05.020]   And it all ultimately comes from these simple ingredients
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:06.540]   with these simple rules.
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:08.700]   And the fact you can generate such complexity from that
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:11.060]   is really mysterious, I think, and strange.
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:12.900]   And it's not even a question that physicists
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.740]   can really tackle, because we are sort of trying
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:19.080]   to find these really elementary laws.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:21.920]   But it turns out that going from elementary laws
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.080]   in a few particles to something even as complicated
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.640]   as a molecule becomes very difficult.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:28.680]   So going from a molecule to a human being
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.000]   is a problem that just can't be tackled,
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.480]   at least not at the moment.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:34.960]   So-- - Yeah, the emergence
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:39.640]   of complexity from simple rules is so beautiful
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:40.640]   and so mysterious.
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:43.640]   And we don't have good mathematics
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.320]   to even try to approach that emergent phenomena.
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.800]   - That's why we have chemistry and biology
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:50.280]   in all the other subjects.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.120]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:55.880]   - I don't think there's a better way to end it, Harry.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.040]   I can't, I mean, I think I speak for a lot of people
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.880]   that can't wait to see what happens
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.820]   in the next five, 10, 20 years with you.
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:06.100]   I think you're one of the great communicators of our time.
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:09.840]   So I hope you continue that, and I hope that grows.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:12.280]   And I'm definitely a huge fan.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:13.920]   So it was an honor to talk to you today.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:14.760]   Thanks so much, man. - It was really fun.
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.360]   Thanks very much.

[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:52.080]   You and I are leftovers.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.560]   Every particle in our bodies is a survivor
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.920]   from an almighty shootout between matter and antimatter
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:00.160]   that happened a little after the Big Bang.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.560]   In fact, only one in a billion particles created
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:06.780]   at the beginning of time have survived to the present day.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.240]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
