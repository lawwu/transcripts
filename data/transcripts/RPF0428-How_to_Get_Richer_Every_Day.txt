[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.960]   Hey radicals, we begin today's show with a short essay
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.840]   There's a fundamental difference between the things you do every day
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.400]   Every single day and the things you do only when the spirit moves you
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.880]   One difference is that once you've committed to doing something daily you find the spirit moves you daily
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.240]   Rather than having a daily debate about today's agenda
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.800]   You can decide once that you will do something and then decide every single day
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.640]   how
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   to do it
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.200]   That is an essay on but written by seth godin called daily
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.460]   Published on his site at on december 21 2014
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.600]   Seth is well known for being a daily blogger somebody who posts a new article each and every single day
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.760]   And i've been thinking a lot about the concept of daily and I have noticed that what seth says
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.320]   in this essay
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.920]   is
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.440]   Seems to be very true
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.400]   The things that you do each and every day the habits that you have each and every day are the ones that stick with you
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.080]   This is very true when it comes to
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.440]   brushing your teeth flossing your teeth
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.280]   Hugging your husband or your wife, whatever the situation is the things that you do each and every day are going to be
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.760]   powerful
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.760]   So how can this be applied to money?
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.440]   Today I want to share with you just some simple ideas
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.800]   That are a bit counter-cultural
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.560]   I'm going to talk against some of the advice that we often get I don't have a perfect solution to this advice
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.180]   but it is a
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.800]   countercurrent
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.120]   Theory that I think will be helpful to you and we're going to kick off the discussion
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.560]   here with reading another essay by
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.760]   Mark ford mark ford is he's also known under the pen name of michael masterson
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.200]   He wrote for years and founded a website called early to rise
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.800]   and
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.600]   I'm going to read to you an essay that he wrote called how to get richer every day
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.240]   I read this essay, I think probably six seven eight years ago
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.640]   He he doesn't have a time stamp on the essay and it's published all over the web
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.560]   So I can't cite the exact time but i've read this essay many years ago and it always stuck with me
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.720]   So here I read
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.360]   Mark's essay called how to get richer every day
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.280]   Of the hundreds of wealth building strategies i've tried over the years. The best one was also the simplest
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.000]   Make sure you get a little bit richer
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.480]   every day
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.640]   This thought occurred to me more than 30 years ago
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.600]   I'd recently decided to become rich and that decision had me reading and thinking about wealth building day and night
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.440]   I had daily fantasies of getting rich in all sorts of fancy ways, but deep down inside. I knew complicated strategies were not for me
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:12.000]   When it came to making money, I was extremely risk averse in the race to a multi-million dollar retirement. I was a tortoise not a hare
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.000]   At the time I had a net worth of zero and an annual salary of thirty five thousand dollars
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.320]   With three small children and my wife in college our expenses were gobbling up every nickel of my after-tax income
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.120]   So my first wealth building goal was small
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.640]   I would get richer by just ten dollars per day
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.680]   I knew I would eventually raise the ante but I wondered
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.600]   How much money would I acquire in say 40 years by just putting an extra ten dollars aside every day in a bank account?
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.680]   earning five percent per year
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.240]   I did the numbers and was happy with the answer almost half a million dollars
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.760]   My total capital invested would be one hundred forty nine thousand six hundred and fifty dollars
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.720]   the simple interest would total one hundred and fifty six thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars and the compounded interest would amount to
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.560]   one hundred and eighty two thousand sixty one dollars for a total of
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.160]   four hundred eighty eight thousand six hundred and sixty one dollars
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.320]   Then I wondered what would happen if I put away fifteen dollars per day
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.720]   That came to seven hundred nineteen thousand six hundred and four dollars
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.520]   And then I asked what would my retirement fund grow to at eight percent that came to just over six one point six two million
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.700]   You can imagine my excitement and so I made this my number one wealth building commandment
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.400]   Get a little bit richer
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.240]   every day
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.300]   But I soon realized that I couldn't follow this rule consistently
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.840]   If I invested my money in stocks the market fluctuated too much
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.240]   I'd be worth one hundred and ten thousand dollars one day and one hundred and eight thousand dollars the next
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.820]   My friends and colleagues who knew more about investing than I did told me not to worry about these short-term fluctuations
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.280]   They said if I kept my focus on the long term i'd get the nine percent or ten percent the market delivers over a long period
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.360]   Of time, but even though I understood the principle. I didn't want to settle for that
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.960]   I resolved the problem. I put the bulk of my retirement savings into municipal bonds
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.360]   high yielding bank cds and
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.580]   Unleveraged rental real estate properties this drastically reduced my portfolio's volatility
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.800]   But it also
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.240]   in theory at least
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.980]   Reduced my expected ultimate return on investment
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.240]   I compensated for that lower roi
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.200]   By taking on more work and devoting a portion of that extra income to my retirement savings
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.760]   That ensured I was always ahead of my schedule, even if the roi I was getting on bonds cds or real estate dropped
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.160]   This simple tortoise paced program worked
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:50.000]   Since I made this resolution in the early 1980s. I have never experienced a single day of being poorer than I was the day before
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.480]   Think about that
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.560]   And there's more submitting yourself to this commandment will change the way you think and feel about building wealth
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.240]   It will help you appreciate the miracle of compound interest. It will make you less accepting of risk
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.280]   It will make it easier to understand the benefits and drawbacks of every type of investing
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.480]   And it will turn you into an income addict
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.560]   Which in my book is an essential component of thinking rich
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.640]   If you want to use this strategy for retiring rich begin as I did with a goal of ten dollars per day
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.320]   Once that becomes easier, you'll find that you want to raise the ante
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.160]   You could hike it to fifteen dollars per day as I did my first year
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.560]   But soon thereafter your addiction to income will make it possible for you to raise your target much higher than that
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.800]   These days my target is ten thousand dollars per day
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.360]   And I do it without worry
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.900]   I've explained this strategy to many people over the years and I don't think a single one ever took it seriously
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.520]   Perhaps it didn't seem clever enough for them or perhaps they felt they were already doing well by following the investment schemes
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.280]   They were using at the time
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.760]   But none of them ever acquired the wealth I did
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.820]   They sometimes had great individual hits they'd tell me about or even streaks of winners when the markets were favorable
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.480]   But as time passed Mr. Market always had his way with them
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.620]   In the race for wealth, I've always been a tortoise
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.200]   But by following this simple rule of getting richer every day
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:24.260]   I was able to do better than I ever expected without a single day of feeling poorer than I was the day before
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.440]   Now again that essay is written by Mark Ford and it's called how to get richer every day
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:40.240]   I hope the concept of the essay grips you because I think it's a particularly valuable concept
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.240]   Unfortunately, I don't think that the essay delivers on its title
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.340]   I think the title is a well-chosen title that is provocative and intriguing
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:56.080]   But the essay doesn't actually answer the question of how the essay simply says you should do this
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.080]   and
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.140]   For years i've had this essay in the back of my mind or the simple concept i've long appreciated
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:11.200]   Mark Ford's writing I stumbled across him when I was in college when he was penning the early to rise blog
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.120]   Which or excuse me?
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.240]   It was primarily centered around a newsletter not a blog the early to rise daily email newsletter
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.640]   And I enjoyed his writing. I found him to be down to earth and extremely
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.260]   Relevant to me and so for years I followed early to rise
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:33.340]   And I found a lot of their concepts very very useful at one point. I considered
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.720]   Getting a job with them and working with them. I was interested in pursuing a job as a copywriter
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.620]   And their offices were based in delray beach, florida
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.740]   And which is near where I live in west palm beach, florida
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.320]   So i've long admired him and i've often admired his writings on wealth and this particular
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.980]   Concept is always stuck in my craw
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.260]   In a good way
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.140]   And so today I just want to talk about it a little bit I want to lead off with simply saying that
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.620]   I don't know how
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:11.100]   To do this. I don't know how to actually get richer every day
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.020]   Mark's concept here is that
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:22.240]   By focusing on the requirement of getting richer every day you will pursue things that are more conservative
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.940]   Because your goal is to make sure you don't lose money and I want to focus on
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.980]   Some and we'll discuss that further in a moment
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:36.640]   But when it actually comes how to guarantee this I don't see any way that it's possible to guarantee
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.140]   It's more of a mindset
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.820]   an ideal
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.180]   that
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.480]   Is useful as a target but never actually attainable
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.380]   fully
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.700]   Although if I could I still think about how could it be done? The reason I say it's never
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.000]   fully
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.280]   Attainable is if you use his examples
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:04.140]   Municipal bonds, you know cds are not going to go down in nominal value. They could go down in real value meaning
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.820]   Their actual stated dollar figure is not going to go down
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.820]   They're guaranteed but they could go down in inflation adjusted terms
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.460]   but municipal bonds can go down in value even though they are more conservative than
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.540]   a portfolio of stocks
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.620]   they still can go down in value if interest rates rise the bond values can fall and if
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.940]   you are not yet at a point in your
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.780]   wealth building career where you're saving as much money per day as your bonds have gone down in value then
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.060]   You could in theory lose money same thing with real estate
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.340]   Even though here he talked about non-leveraged real estate the value of a real estate portfolio can fall
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:46.220]   Now my guess would be that if I were talking to mark about this concept and I were raising those objections he would say
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.100]   You should be paying attention to that. He would say
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.040]   If your goal is to get richer every day, then you should be paying attention
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.320]   And recognizing that you might need to adjust your portfolio
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.580]   I think he would say that because I know that
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:04.620]   Back in 2007 2008 when south florida real estate was heavily hit
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:11.100]   I don't believe that he was fully invested in the local south florida real estate market at that time
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:17.920]   And perhaps this theory that he has that I have to get richer every day was a theory that influenced his decisions
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.060]   When the risk
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.340]   Rose in real estate. He focused on getting out
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.380]   So I don't know how to teach you how to get richer every day
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:33.260]   I do know that my appreciation of this concept
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.380]   Has dramatically changed?
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.220]   In the last five to ten years in my own thinking
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:46.700]   I grew up reading the basic nuts and bolts of
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.040]   mainstream personal finance
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.980]   and one of the core pieces of advice that is given in mainstream personal finance is
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.220]   When you are younger you can afford to take more investment risk
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:10.540]   This is usually advice that's given in the context of selecting a portfolio of stocks
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:16.640]   The idea is that if you're younger you can afford to be more aggressive with your portfolio
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:24.540]   Because you have more time to wait out any drops in the value of the market
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.340]   In the stock market if you want to get a higher total potential return
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:39.340]   You have to be willing to sit through periods of higher volatility, which means greater risk of short-term loss
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:47.260]   So traditionally those who are young are advised and if you're not advising this there's no way that you're going to keep an investment license
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.660]   So this is 100
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.720]   mandated group think
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.700]   Those who are younger are advised to have portfolios that are
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.580]   weighted more to the risky side
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.460]   A higher percentage of
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.740]   stocks
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:07.980]   Versus bonds and here by risk i'm referring to volatility. So let me switch to using volatility rather than risk
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:15.660]   The idea is that younger investors can manage a portfolio with more volatility more ups and downs
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.980]   I get that
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.980]   And to some degree I think it's true
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:30.300]   It's especially true if you could in some way guarantee or at least heavily influence an investor to stay invested through the down times
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.380]   after all
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.020]   A loss is only a real loss
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.820]   If you realize the loss
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.100]   You can have a loss that's on paper
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.340]   a nominal loss
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.180]   The value of the assets has gone down when measured to market value
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.960]   But you don't actually recognize the loss or realize the loss until you sell the investments
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.180]   So younger people by not needing the money sooner
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:05.580]   Should be able to sit tight through market downturns and thus not realize the losses and they have more time for the portfolio to rebound
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.460]   So I think that investment strategy is sound
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:14.220]   I can't it makes sense in a way
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:20.220]   And again every single licensed financial advisor, which I used to be I am no longer
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.780]   But every single licensed financial advisor is going to be required to make
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.300]   recommendations on that basis for for clients
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.320]   The younger you are the more aggressive you can be I stand by that recommendation
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.460]   I have no problem with young people owning a portfolio of 100% stocks
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.260]   I have more questions about
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:44.380]   Somebody recommending a portfolio 100% stocks to somebody who's 90 years old
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.460]   But the problem that I have is this
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:59.660]   When is it more devastating for you to lose money
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.260]   When you're poorer
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.660]   Or when you're richer
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:12.060]   And when I overlay that question
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.180]   To what mark ford talks about in his essay
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:21.500]   I have a hard time being as confident in the financial advice that I used to give to young people
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.780]   to go all in stocks
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.420]   I've increasingly come to appreciate
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:37.200]   The safety or having safe money and i've increasingly come to appreciate
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.880]   having
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.620]   Accessible money, especially for young people
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.420]   I
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.860]   Want you to consider this question and i'm going to use extreme examples to demonstrate the point
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.300]   If
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.300]   You are very poor
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.860]   And you have a hundred dollars in savings
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.780]   And you lose 50 of your savings
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:07.260]   Your hundred dollars of savings drops to fifty dollars in savings
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:12.380]   Think about the impact that will have on your life
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.860]   If you were in that situation
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:21.580]   Now compare that to somebody who has one million dollars of savings
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:28.940]   And they lose 50 of their savings dropping them to five hundred thousand dollars of savings
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.100]   And think about the impact of that on their life
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:40.140]   Certainly neither of these people is going to be happy
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.300]   But
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.020]   If you had a hundred dollars in savings and you lost half of it
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.540]   That might mean that your cell phone bill doesn't get paid
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.580]   Or that you and your children don't eat today
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:58.860]   There is a huge potential disruption in your day today
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.020]   If you lose fifty dollars of your hundred dollars of savings
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:09.020]   But if you have a million dollars of savings and it goes down in value to five hundred thousand dollars
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.100]   You're most likely going to eat
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.700]   And you're most likely going to be able to pay your cell phone bill
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:21.180]   It's much more devastating
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.300]   for you to lose money when you are
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.020]   Poorer than when you are richer
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:33.280]   At least in terms of impact on your lifestyle. I don't know whether it's more devastating psychologically
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.780]   To watch half a million dollars disappear versus watching fifty dollars disappear
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.980]   I don't I have not researched that question to see if it's been studied in an academic format
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:49.020]   But it's much more devastating with potential impact to your life
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.740]   I think that we who are
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.700]   Thinking about money and we who are giving financial advice
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:05.260]   Should really consider how to apply this concept of getting richer every day as a way to hedge against this risk
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.420]   First I think it's a useful way of considering. I think it's a useful way of thinking
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.140]   What can I do today?
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:21.020]   To get a little bit richer. What can I do today to set a little bit more aside? What can I do today?
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.980]   To make sure that my investments grow in value
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.660]   I think by not accepting
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:32.780]   I think that often i've been too cavalier about accepting the potential for loss
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:41.420]   And as i'm getting older still being a young person but thinking more about money i'm much less accepting of the potential for loss
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:46.780]   I want a little greater margin of safety
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.900]   And as I consider all of the clients that i've worked with and all the situations that i've interacted with
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.540]   I think we underestimate the impact of loss, especially in the early years
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:02.300]   It's pretty devastating for young people to lose substantial amounts of money
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.940]   Yes, they have more time
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.140]   They can keep working and do it and earn it back again
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.340]   But it's pretty devastating
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.460]   And when I think about a scenario like mark ford
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.880]   Discussed in his essay here
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.380]   I find an elegant simplicity in this type of advice
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:31.020]   Start by making sure that you get ten dollars richer every single day and then move your goals up
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.780]   This type of focus puts your attention in the right space
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:42.220]   For example, if your goal is to get ten dollars richer every day that's going to start with your saving ten dollars every day
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.940]   Then if you're doing like he described and you
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.260]   You refuse to go
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:55.980]   To have your wealth drop on any day. You're going to naturally purchase appreciating assets rather than depreciating assets
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:02.700]   Rather than depreciating assets if you're tracking your net worth on a daily basis, you're naturally going to avoid
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.500]   Purchasing the car that will depreciate quickly
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.740]   Or purchasing the consumer item that will depreciate quickly and you're naturally going to move in a positive direction
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.500]   You're going to recognize that I need to set this aside so that the interest grows
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:21.420]   This simple concept could help many young people
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.460]   Avoid many of the consumerist mistakes
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:34.860]   Get richer every single day that means in the early years you can't buy the expensive stuff
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:44.460]   You can't buy the expensive stuff until your wealth is paying for it the increases of your wealth are paying for it
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:52.060]   I think this also puts the focus in the right direction of focusing on safety first safe investments first
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:57.680]   And the reason I think this is so powerful is that safe investments will give the person more confidence
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:07.740]   I've observed that when I've owned stocks, I often have not had a lot of confidence in the dollars printed on that page
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.400]   Because of the volatility now intellectually
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:18.860]   I've trained myself to be a good investor so that intellectually I can handle it and I can discipline myself
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.940]   But i've noticed emotionally a different effect when I own things that are safer
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:36.300]   And i've noticed how much freer my decision making has been when i've had more of my wealth into things that are safer
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:41.740]   Given the choice between this appreciation of safety
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:48.780]   And the academic intellectual acknowledgement of higher potential returns if I would just discipline myself
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   I'm finding a higher level of happiness
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.100]   with safety
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.660]   A higher level of enjoyment of life with safety
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.620]   That doesn't mean i'm not willing to take a risk
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:06.480]   I hope that's coming through loud and clear that doesn't mean i'm disagreeing with the fact that younger investors
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.280]   Can afford to have a portfolio that's allocated more aggressively
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.500]   What I am taking issue with
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:21.260]   Is the idea that that advice the advice for young people to invest aggressively in stocks
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.280]   Actually works most effectively
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:33.820]   I'm not convinced it does anymore and i'm not convinced it does because I don't think it keeps people's focus in the right area
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:40.380]   Mark ford's strategy here is behavioral and that's my third point about it
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.420]   It's behavioral
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.380]   In order to actually follow through and get richer every day you have to track your money
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.700]   You have to save diligently you have to research and think about investments
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:58.540]   You have to think about risk very very carefully and make sure that you understand it. You have to calculate risk
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:07.820]   That's how I could see stock investing fitting into this strategy now mark is not a huge fan of
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.420]   Of mainstream stock advice, but I have no problem fitting that into this
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.060]   this simply means that
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:21.200]   You calculate the standard deviation of your portfolio that gives you or you use the number that is the calculated standard deviation of your portfolio
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:29.580]   That gives you what the the volatility might be and then you take that number and you fit that number into your planning
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:35.900]   On on your portfolio so that you make sure that as he said if i'm getting ten thousand dollars richer every day
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:43.520]   Then make sure that on any average day. It's less likely that my portfolio is going to go down by more than ten thousand dollars
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.820]   That'll make a big difference over time
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:56.940]   I don't have anything more to add on the the on this topic than that
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:01.260]   So i'm going to wrap up the show with just a couple of quick things that you can do to pay attention on a daily
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.500]   basis very practical things
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.940]   Because if you want to get richer every day, it may start for some of you by thinking about it conceptually
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.940]   But for most of us it starts with actions
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:17.980]   And the things that we do daily are usually the things that are going to make the biggest impact in our lives
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.260]   Notice this in the food that I eat
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:28.060]   I've noticed that people who exercise consistently generally tend to be those who do it just about every day
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.460]   with rare exceptions
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.020]   Notice this in a number of a number of places
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.140]   So here are just a few simple things that you can do
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.860]   To focus on a daily basis so that you can continue to get richer every day
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:46.700]   Bring focus and attention to your money
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:51.740]   Write down every single financial transaction on a three by five card and consider
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.980]   figuring out
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.940]   How much your expenses cost you on a daily basis?
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.540]   If you wanted to get richer every day, you would have to actually know how much was coming in every day
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.020]   And actually know how much was being spent
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.820]   every day
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:13.420]   One suggestion i've made in past episodes of the show and I have found very useful is to change the scale
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.580]   Of the financial transaction in order to make it more relevant
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:25.580]   If you take a and you're just simply looking at say the difference between renting a two thousand dollar a month apartment and a three thousand
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.180]   dollar a month apartment
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.380]   it doesn't sound like that big of a difference because
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.260]   both of those are in the ranges of
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.220]   of appropriate rents
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.020]   That that people that people are make are will pay
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:44.780]   But if you break two thousand dollars down into 30 days and recognize that you're going to be spending 66 dollars per day
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:48.620]   And the question is do you want to spend 66 dollars per day?
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.580]   Or a hundred dollars per day on your rent?
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:56.480]   All of a sudden that number can be more emotionally strategic
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.760]   So write down each transaction and then figure out how to look at it on a daily basis
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:08.640]   If you're going to get richer every day, you need to know how much you're spending every day and how much you're saving every day
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:16.960]   A couple other little tips make sure that you're saving money every single day
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:25.360]   If it's possible that mark ford's concept is only useful in the early stages of wealth
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.120]   It's possible that it's not as useful down the road
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   I don't know since I don't know him. I haven't asked him this
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:39.760]   I don't know how much of this is written for rhetorical flourish versus something that he actually does every day
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.160]   I don't know
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.080]   Most things that are useful when we're just learning them simply become habits and then those habits guide us to the right place
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.600]   But in the early years, I think this could be so valuable
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.680]   If you want to save money every day a great place to start is with a piggy bank or
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.800]   modern jar version of that
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.840]   And put a ten dollar bill in there every day
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:10.640]   Or set up a daily transfer from your checking account to your savings account every day
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:17.680]   Make sure that you're prioritizing setting aside money every day
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.760]   Or I have also found this to be very powerful in my own life if you're paying down debt
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:31.920]   Make sure that you owe less money at the end of every day than when you started
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.040]   I love
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.440]   I mean, I think the word that some people would put on this would be the concept of little snowflake payments, right?
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.240]   Coming up against the the concept of a debt snowball
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.160]   snowflakes
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.160]   Basically just put little chunks
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.880]   And keep a focus on it every day
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:55.280]   I've recently tried to really home in and resurrect some of my skills that have gotten rusty
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:02.000]   So i'm writing out my goals every day. I'm writing out my list of projects every day. I am
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.280]   Putting those on I put those on a three by five card
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.200]   I have a couple three by five cards slide it in my pocket rewrite them in the morning
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.060]   That daily focus on those projects and goals and top priorities
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.480]   Helps me to focus my energy on the things that matter
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.280]   And doing it every day
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.840]   Is very helpful
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.320]   So if you're trying to pay down debt
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:31.520]   Make sure that on your three by five card you write down. My goal is to be debt-free by the date of
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:40.240]   And here's how much I owe then make sure that every day you can put a little check mark towards that
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.400]   I'm focusing on my personal health
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.040]   Really seeking to make progress on that
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.560]   So each and every day, what is the thing that i'm doing today?
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.440]   To make sure that i'm moving
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.600]   That i'm increasing my health. What am I doing today to contribute to this goal?
