[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Well, now let us return to the matter that's before us, which is this great and important
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.680]   statement which is found in the ninth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.560]   And I'd better read again from verse 19 to verse 24.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.080]   Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault?
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.640]   For who hath resisted his will?
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.200]   Say but, O men, who art thou that replyest against God?
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.440]   Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.760]   and another unto dishonour?
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.000]   What if God, willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.520]   longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction, and that he might make known
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.720]   the riches of his glory and the vessels of mercy which he had aforeprepared unto glory,
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.760]   even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.680]   Very well, let me remind you what we've been doing.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.320]   Here this objection is put forward to the reasoning which the apostle had implied from
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.280]   the beginning of verse 6, but in particular to the reason that he had implied from verse
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.200]   14 to verse 18.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.040]   The question is, very well then, if this is something God does and is all-powerful in
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.560]   his sovereign will, how can he blame anybody for not believing?
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.120]   If it is entirely God's action, how can he with justice condemn anybody?
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.680]   Why doth he yet find fault?
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.800]   Now, the apostle's reply takes this form.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.360]   He first of all rebukes the questioner for ever putting such a question.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.960]   'Nay, but, O man, what?
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.120]   Thou that replyest against God.'
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.880]   Apart from what we say, we must always remember that when we are speaking about God, we must
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.640]   be very careful.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.400]   Whatever we may be saying, we must never speak about God in any respect as we would speak
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   about a man.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.000]   We must never speak about anything God has said or anything God has done in the same
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.140]   way as we speak about anything that men may have said or men may have done.
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.680]   We must always remember that we are considering something that the almighty and everlasting
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.920]   God has said or done.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.320]   And that means that our whole spirit should conform.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.240]   We should humble ourselves.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   We should lie in the dust.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:53.480]   Or, as we find it was indicated to Moses and to Joshua, here is the commandment, 'Take
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.400]   off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground.'
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   We must never approach any teaching of the Bible, any doctrine of the Bible, except in
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.440]   that spirit of humility and of reverence and of a childlike spirit which is ready to learn,
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.680]   but which has no content, opinions, assured notions, have no place in the study of the
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680]   scripture.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.680]   And anybody who comes with such prejudices, still more with passion or with bad temper,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.800]   might as well go out immediately.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.600]   Not only will you not learn, but your attempt to learn will do you more harm than good.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.120]   And you may find coming upon yourself the woe of God.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.720]   'Who art thou, O man, that replyest against God?'
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.560]   I repeat that because it is no use going on with this discussion unless our spirit is
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   right, unless we realize exactly what we are doing.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.880]   We are not here to blend the opinions.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.400]   We are here to consider the message of the truth of God.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.520]   Then having said that, you see, he goes on and shows, as we saw last Friday, the monstrous
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.160]   position of the thing formed, the plastic material, asking a question of the one who
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.480]   formed it into a shape.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.040]   The thing is ridiculous.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.800]   'Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, "Why hast thou made me thus?"'
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.400]   He ridicules the whole thing.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.520]   If we only saw ourselves as we really are, oh, how much less would we talk and how less
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.680]   frequently would we express our confident, arrogant opinions.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:47.400]   We would put our hands upon our mouths, as Job did, and wonder at ourselves, at our temerity
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.120]   and folly and venturing to speak as we do about these sacred things.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.040]   But then he goes on to put it still more plainly.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.760]   He says now quite explicitly that the relationship between God and form, humanity, is this.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.400]   'Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel into one
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   and another to dishonor?'
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.040]   Now, then, I mustn't keep you with this, but it means this, we saw, you remember.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.760]   This is God's relationship to fallen humanity.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.320]   Not referring to creation at the beginning.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.640]   Here is this massive perdition, this lump of fallen humanity.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.280]   What the apostle is saying is this, that God has a right to do as he likes with it.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.840]   It all deserves to be damned.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.960]   But God has chosen to save some out of some of it to make vessels and to honor, and of
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.600]   the rest to make vessels to dishonor.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   Why shouldn't he?
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:48.040]   He has a right because he is God and because the whole world lieth guilty before him.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.040]   Now then, that is the point at which we have arrived so far, and I ended by giving you
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.920]   some reasons to show why modern men in particular are the very last who should cavil at this
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.880]   kind of teaching.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.040]   He is generally a fatalist or a determinist, a Freudian or something like that.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.200]   He is the very last who should cavil.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.360]   But I needn't have said that.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.800]   This is more than sufficient in and of itself.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:23.600]   Well now, we proceed with his argument because he goes on in verses 22 and 23 to do something
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.000]   further.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:35.600]   Now in 20b and 21, he has been asserting, as I have shown you, God's right to do this.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.920]   But in verses 22 and 23, he gives us God's reason for doing this.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.080]   Now, there was no need for this.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.440]   We have no right to ask for reasons.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.720]   We have no claim upon God at all.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.600]   We deserve nothing but punishment and hell.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.120]   If anybody thinks that he or she does deserve anything else, well, all I say is, you don't
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.320]   know God, and you don't know yourself either.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.080]   The attitude taken up by all who have had any glimpse of God, as we read in the Bible,
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.920]   is that with Isaiah they feel that they are men of unclean lips.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.320]   They fall down in utter hopelessness and helplessness.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.920]   We have no right to ask for any reason, but God in his infinite kindness and condescension
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.400]   stoops to our weakness and gives us reasons.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.480]   And here the apostle does that very thing.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.800]   Now, he puts it in rather an odd way.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.120]   There is a bit of a difficulty about these two verses because the apostle does something
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.600]   which he does now and again.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.160]   And I very nearly said, thank God that he does.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.520]   He starts off a sentence and doesn't finish it.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.160]   There's nothing wrong in that, as long as the meaning is plain.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.720]   You notice he starts off with a condition.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.600]   Here I read in the Authorized, it says, "What if God?"
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.800]   Well, now, there's no "what" in the original.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.520]   He said, "If God willing."
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.080]   In other words, he starts with a condition.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.360]   And you expect that there'll be a sort of conclusion to it, but he never gives us the
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360]   conclusion.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:20.480]   "What if," then, well, you say, "There's a reply to that," but he doesn't give us the
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   reply.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.280]   In other words, the reply is conveyed, as it were, by the very form in which he puts
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.740]   the question.
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.120]   So it could be taken something like this.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:40.640]   "If God has done this, what can men reply against it?"
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.800]   That's what he's really saying.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.920]   And sometimes you can make a question like that more dramatic by not supplying the answer.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.200]   You start with your condition, but you don't supply the conclusion.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.680]   And so it's in a still more arresting manner before you.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.680]   What he's saying is, "What objection can there be to that?"
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.440]   Now then, let's look exactly at his statement and what he's saying.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.280]   In the two verses together, the apostle is making this statement, that the reason for
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:20.640]   God's action in hardening some and punishing others, in hardening some and punishing them,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:27.480]   and in showing mercy and compassion to others and saving them, is that his own glory and
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:34.360]   his own being might be made known and might be manifested.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:41.400]   And he says that both aspects of God's action do that, and that they both do it at the same
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   time.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:49.040]   Now there's the general statement, but you see, he divides it up into two.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.480]   In verse 22, we have the manifestation of God's wrath.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:01.800]   In verse 23, we have the manifestation of God's mercy.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.920]   Well now, let's look at this statement.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.480]   It's the most important one.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.600]   Verse 22 is the wrath aspect of this.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:17.200]   And he starts off by saying, "What if God willing to show his wrath?"
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:25.320]   Now this word "willing" is really not a good translation here.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:33.080]   It really means "wishing," and it's even stronger than that.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.160]   It could be translated, "What if God inclined to?"
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:46.600]   And then even that isn't strong enough, because it means a deep and a strong desire.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.520]   Now that's the real translation of the word "willing."
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.480]   Now a German commentator of the last century, I think, has put this very well.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:04.560]   He's paraphrased it by putting it like this, "Notwithstanding that his holy will disposes
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.400]   him not to leave unmanifested his wrath and his power."
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.120]   Now that's a very good way of putting it.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.880]   It's a paraphrase, but it does bring out the meaning.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:19.800]   "Notwithstanding that his holy will disposes him," and it disposes him very strongly,
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.160]   "it is the whole of his nature that disposes him to this."
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.960]   Now that's exactly what the apostle is saying.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:37.560]   God with this whole disposal or disposition of his nature to do this, nevertheless.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.280]   Now let's bear that in mind, therefore.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:49.400]   Now the apostle is asserting, therefore, that everything in God, because he is God, because
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:57.080]   of his holy nature, because of his just and righteous and holy character, everything is
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   in God, hates sin.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.880]   Sin and God are eternal opposites.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:13.160]   And with all the intensity of his being, God abhors sin and he hates it and desires to
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.280]   punish it.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:22.520]   That is something that is of necessity true about God.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:31.040]   And the apostle says that in punishing sin, therefore, God shows forth these aspects of
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:38.440]   his own being and character, or if you prefer it, he displays these attributes of his own
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.300]   eternal and glorious being.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:49.880]   It is in punishing sin, bringing destruction upon those who are sinners, finally, that
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:13:01.760]   God, he says, has made known and does make known his wrath and the power of his wrath.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.680]   Now this is something, of course, that we see constantly as we read the Bible.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.760]   It's in the Old Testament and in the New.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.400]   The apostle has already given us one very striking example of that in the case of Pharaoh,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.920]   which he quoted in the seventeenth verse.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   God in handling Pharaoh in the way that he did, as the apostle has told us there.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.160]   The scripture saith unto Pharaoh, "Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:33.800]   I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   earth."
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:41.200]   Very well, he is saying that same thing once more.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:48.720]   That God's reason for doing this is that he might display, give this manifestation,
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:55.200]   this clear demonstration, not only of his wrath against sin and his utter abominations
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:02.080]   of it, and how it can't exist in the presence of God, but the power of this wrath, and his
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.280]   might and his majesty, and his greatness and his glory.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.960]   Well, of course, that's only one illustration of it.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:17.520]   And what the apostle is saying is that in every manifestation of God's wrath upon sin,
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:26.120]   God is making known his attitude towards sin, his power to punish it, and thereby this fuller
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:32.720]   manifestation of the glory and the majesty of his person.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:39.800]   Now what you and I sometimes tend, I think, to forget is this, that this aspect of the
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:48.640]   character and the being of God would never have been known if he did not punish sin.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.480]   It is by punishing sin that God makes this known.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:59.560]   What if God is willing to show his wrath and to make his power known?
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.080]   Now this is very important, therefore.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.880]   You see, the apostle is facing this whole problem from the standpoint of the being and
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   the person and the attributes of God's character.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.000]   And half our troubles, I believe, arise as we are considering this kind of doctrine,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.320]   that we start with ourselves and we end with ourselves and look at ourselves, consider
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.880]   God.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:31.920]   The truth is that because God is God and because God is what he is, I say it with reverence,
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.720]   there are certain things that God must do.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.080]   And one of them is he must punish sin.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.720]   God would not be God if he did not punish sin.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.560]   His very nature is such that he must.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.200]   It is the compulsion of his own nature.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:58.840]   And what the apostle says, therefore, is that God, in punishing sin, lets us know this about
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.760]   his nature, about his being, and about his attributes.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:09.880]   The wrath of God against sin, as this apostle has reminded us in the seventeenth verse of
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:15.720]   the first chapter of this great epistle, is something that has already been revealed.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.760]   You remember, we came across it in the eighteenth verse.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:27.380]   "For the wrath of God has been revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.400]   of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.440]   The ultimate trouble with people who do not believe in the doctrine of the wrath of God
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.040]   is this, that they do not believe the biblical revelation of God.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.800]   They have got a God of their own created.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.680]   You will generally find that people who reject the biblical doctrine of the wrath of God
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.040]   also reject the biblical doctrine of redemption and of salvation.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.240]   They are quite consistent.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.040]   If you do not believe in the wrath of God, there is no real need for the sacrifice on
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.840]   Calvary's hill.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.120]   It would never have happened.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:11.240]   So you see, it is important we should view all these things in the light of the great
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.480]   doctrine of God himself.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.200]   "Very well," says the apostle, "here is one thing.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:27.760]   When God has revealed this wrath, he does so in order that he may give us this knowledge
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.960]   concerning himself and his eternal being."
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:38.880]   Now, you notice that he puts it like this, "God, willing to show his wrath and to make
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:48.040]   his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.760]   The wrath of God, he says, is shown to the vessels of wrath."
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.760]   What does that mean?
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.480]   Well, it is just a term that is used very commonly in the scripture.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:05.560]   It means an instrument through which God shows his wrath.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.640]   Sometimes the expression is used, "children of wrath."
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:16.440]   The apostle says to the Ephesians, among whom we all had our conversation in time past,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.960]   he says, "When we walked according to the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:26.040]   of the body and of the mind, and we are all the children of wrath, even as others."
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.600]   It is the same kind of idea.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.080]   He says, "These are vessels of wrath.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.920]   They are the instruments or the utensils, as it were, whom God uses to show this."
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.120]   That is the connotation.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.080]   But the really interesting word here is the word "fitted."
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:52.360]   Now then, let us look at this word, "vessels of wrath fitted to destruction."
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.080]   And I want to show you the real significance and importance of this word.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.520]   The right translation here, again, or at least the full translation is this, "the vessels
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:14.760]   of wrath having been fitted," or if you prefer it, "the vessels of wrath ripe for destruction."
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:21.880]   Or, still more loosely, you could say, "the vessels of wrath being ready for destruction."
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:30.560]   Now, the significance is this, that the apostle does not say that it is God who has fitted
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.320]   them for this.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.000]   He says that they have been fitted for destruction.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.720]   He does not tell us who has fitted them for destruction.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.040]   Why do I make a point of that?
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.440]   Well, for this reason.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.480]   In the twenty-third verse, when you come to the vessels of mercy, what you read is, "which
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.000]   he had afore prepared unto glory, namely God."
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.080]   In other words, God has not prepared the vessels of wrath to destruction, but he has prepared
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:07.280]   the vessels of mercy unto the glory, which you see puts it absolutely into line with
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.440]   what we have seen in our previous exposition.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.400]   God never created a sinner.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.320]   God did not create this lump of fallen humanity.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.200]   God created man perfect in his own image and likeness.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.560]   Yes, he created the whole world perfect.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.560]   It is man who fits himself for destruction, not God.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.240]   And it is most interesting how the apostle brings that out here, "the vessels of wrath
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.600]   fitted," having been fitted.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.600]   What has fitted them to it?
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.560]   Well, what has fitted them to it is their own sin.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.720]   First of all, the fall of men, then their own sin and their own disobedience, and on
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.700]   top of that, if you like, the hardening process, which we have already considered in the case
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.360]   of Pharaoh, men's failure to react to the light and the grace of God's love, and thereby
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.120]   become still more sinful, and that fits him still more for destruction than he was already
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.120]   fitted.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:05.520]   But the serious and the important thing is this, that it is made quite clear that they
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:11.360]   are not fitted to destruction by God.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:17.320]   They are fit for destruction, they are ripe for it, but that is entirely as the result
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:26.000]   of men's sin and disobedience and his rebellion against God.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.360]   And you notice that what they are fitted for is nothing short of destruction.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:39.680]   What the same apostle calls in 2 Thessalonians 1, everlasting destruction from the presence
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.560]   of the Lord.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.880]   We need not go into that tonight.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.800]   It means perdition.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:50.360]   It means eternal banishment out of the presence of God and his glory, and the enjoyment of
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.160]   his being forever.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.160]   Destruction.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:22:01.520]   Very well, he says that God has shown and has made known and has manifested this aspect
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:08.400]   of his character in connection with these vessels of wrath that have become fit for
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.160]   nothing but that destruction.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:18.440]   It is a tremendous statement, this.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.160]   But then he goes on to say another most interesting thing here.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.240]   You notice it.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:32.120]   That though God would have been fully justified in consigning to that destruction the whole
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:38.560]   of fallen humanity, and though he would have been justified in doing it at once and immediately
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:44.720]   and without any delay at all, actually he hasn't done that.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.720]   What has he done?
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:55.600]   Well, he has endured, he says, with much longsuffering, these vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.880]   Now what's the meaning of this?
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:03.440]   Well I believe that he's again carrying in his mind the case of Pharaoh, which he's
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.440]   already considered, as I've reminded you, in verse 17.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.040]   God knew beforehand exactly what Pharaoh was going to do, and announced, you remember,
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.280]   to Moses that he was going to harden his heart.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.680]   God didn't immediately destroy Pharaoh.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.080]   No, he endured him.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.920]   He endured his rebellion, his arrogance, his disobedience.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:29.120]   He endured it for some time, sent Moses and Aaron back to him to plead with him, and so
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.200]   on.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:35.640]   And it was only after a period that he finally destroyed him and his hosts in the Red Sea.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:42.080]   Well now, the apostle says this is a general principle in God's dealing with the whole
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.120]   of human humanity.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.320]   And here is a question I'm sure that we've all often raised and have often considered
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.720]   or argued with people.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.200]   The question can be put like this.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:03.560]   Why does God tolerate the world at all?
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:10.480]   Why didn't God destroy the whole of humanity the moment Adam sinned?
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.200]   Why does God tolerate so much evil and godlessness in this present world?
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.280]   Christian people have often felt like asking that question.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.920]   You'll often find the psalmist asking that question.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.200]   The psalmist can't understand God.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.900]   Why does he tolerate this?
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.900]   Why doesn't he arise?
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.040]   Why doesn't he destroy his enemies?
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.760]   He's in difficulties.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.560]   And many, I say, have often been in this very difficulty.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.960]   Well now, that's the very question that the apostle, I think, is putting before us
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   here.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.080]   And it's very good that we should consider it, because it's a question that not only
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.760]   comes sometimes into the minds of Christian people.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:52.080]   As that second epistle of Peter, chapter 3, reminded us at the beginning, the Scots, the
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.400]   unbelievers, are very fond of putting this question.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.480]   They come forward and they say, "You people preach that there is a great God who is over
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.600]   all and that he's a judge and that he's going to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.560]   You say that he judged it once at the flood and that he's going to judge it again.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.960]   But they say, where is the promise of his coming?"
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.880]   They say, "Nothing seems to be happening.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:20.400]   Since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.400]   creation."
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.640]   They say, "You Christian preachers, you've been saying that this Jesus of yours has risen
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.400]   from the dead, he's ascended to heaven, he's seated at the right hand of God, and that
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.880]   he's only waiting until his enemies shall be made his footstool, and that he's going
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:40.240]   to come back and judge the world in righteousness, destroy his enemies, the devil and hell included,
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.840]   and set up his glorious kingdom."
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.440]   "But," they say, "when's it going to happen?
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.880]   You've been saying that for years now and nothing's happening.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.840]   They were saying that in the first century.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.760]   And you and I are in the twentieth century.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.320]   And there are many people whose faith is shaken by this kind of question that is put by the
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.320]   scoffers."
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.480]   Now, that's the question, you remember, that Peter answers there in that third chapter
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.360]   of his second epistle, and particularly in verse nine, which I always feel is a very
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.040]   interesting commentary on this verse that we're looking at together now, this twenty-second
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.120]   verse of the ninth chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.480]   Let me read to you then the ninth verse of 2 Peter 3.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.920]   His reply is that the Lord is not slack concerning his promise, but take verse eight before it.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.040]   "Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.840]   years, and a thousand years as one day."
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.200]   That's important, but listen.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:45.000]   "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, but is longsuffering
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:54.120]   to usward, or to youward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   to repentance."
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.200]   Now, then, bear that in your mind.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:07.120]   Take also with it the statement that we already met when we were doing the second chapter
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.160]   in the fourth verse, which reads like this.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.880]   This is the epistle to the Romans, chapter 2, verse 4.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:21.400]   "Or despises thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.400]   that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance."
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:31.160]   Now, it's a long time ago we discussed that, but we went into it very thoroughly, and it's
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.800]   important we should bear in mind the conclusions we arrived at at that point.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.040]   Now, here is the question.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.120]   Why does God tolerate evil men for so long?
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:47.400]   Why doesn't he, if he is holy, as you say, why doesn't he destroy them immediately?
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.480]   Well, now, here are the answers.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:58.560]   One, it is because of his longsuffering, his compassion.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.320]   This is a doctrine that perplexes some people, so let me give you some further evidence.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:08.000]   Let me take you back to the book of Ezekiel.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.240]   And first of all, we go to chapter 18.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.080]   Ezekiel chapter 18, verses 23 and 32.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.560]   Here is verse 23 in Ezekiel 18.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:28.360]   "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die, saith the Lord, and not that he
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.800]   should return from his ways and live?"
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:39.560]   Then verse 32, "For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.560]   God.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.360]   Wherefore, turn yourselves, and live ye."
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:55.600]   And then go to the 33rd chapter of that same prophet, Ezekiel.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   And here it is in verse 11, "Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:11.280]   in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:20.320]   Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:26.080]   Now take those statements with the statement in Romans 2, verse 4, the statement we've
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:32.400]   got before us, and the statement in 2 Peter 3, verse 9.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   What do they mean?
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:39.680]   Well, what they mean is this, that God has compassion, that God has longsuffering.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:48.040]   God has no pleasure in the death of the ungodly.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.720]   God has no desire for the will of the ungodly.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.840]   He has no pleasure in it.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.520]   That is perfectly plain and clear.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:03.040]   It's explicit in the three quotations which I have given you from Ezekiel, and it's
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:09.480]   there equally plain and explicit in 2 Peter 3, verse 9.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.120]   Well how do you reconcile that, says somebody with the teaching which we have here in Romans
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.120]   9?
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:19.840]   And the answer must be this.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:28.360]   Those other verses concentrate on what God desires, or what gives God pleasure.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:36.880]   But here in Romans 9 we are teaching with what God has willed in the sense of decreeing.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.440]   God as God cannot have any pleasure in the death of a sinner.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.240]   He can't have pleasure in a sinner at all.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.320]   The whole notion of sin is displeasing to God.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.680]   He has no pleasure in that.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.600]   He has no desire for that.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.600]   So it is not the desire of God that any should perish.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:31:01.000]   Indeed, it is the desire of God that all should come to repentance.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.280]   But it is not God's will that all should come to repentance.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.360]   Because it is God's desire that all should come to repentance, God has ordained that
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.920]   the gospel should be preached to all, and that all men everywhere should be commanded
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.400]   to repent and to believe the gospel.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:25.140]   The free offer of salvation is to be made to everybody.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.720]   That is the expression of God's desire.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.360]   But here in Romans 9 what we are being told is this.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.960]   Why does anybody believe at all?
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.240]   God's desire that men should be saved does not save anybody.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.400]   It is God's will and determination that saves.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:51.920]   And what we are told about that is that God has only willed and determined to save some.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.600]   But this is most important.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:32:01.520]   God in showing this long suffering and in enduring, as we are told, the habits and the
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.680]   practices and the arrogance and the violence of unbelievers whom he could have destroyed
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:14.400]   in a flash, in enduring them, God is showing that he has no pleasure in what they are,
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.040]   no pleasure in destroying them.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:21.960]   He is allowing them to go on, as it were, in order that they might listen to this gospel.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.920]   That is God's desire.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.680]   That is God's pleasure.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.840]   But he does not save them.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.960]   His long suffering and patience with Pharaoh did not change Pharaoh.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.440]   Our Lord's patience and long suffering with Judas did not change him.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.680]   God's long suffering with this world in which we live, with the whole human race,
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.840]   is not bringing it to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:54.080]   But what a demonstration it is of the long suffering and the patience of God.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.080]   We would never know anything about the long suffering and the patience of God if he did
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.440]   not withhold his wrath.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.800]   You see, the verse is really saying this.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:09.840]   God, whose whole being urges him to punish sin, held back that urge, as it were, in order
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.680]   that he might show this long suffering, this endurance, this patience with sinful men.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.200]   That is exactly what the statement is saying.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:25.600]   So that is his first reason for enduring, with much long suffering, the evil that is
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.600]   in the world.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.640]   Now I do trust that this is really of some help to you.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.640]   Have you not often contemplated this question?
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.320]   If God is all-powerful, why does he not deal with it?
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.600]   Here is part of the answer.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.760]   Not willing that any should perish, he does not desire that, but that all should come
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.560]   into repentance.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:55.840]   Now draw that sharp distinction between what God's pleasure is, what God's desire is,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.440]   and what God's will is.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.600]   God never desired that mankind should be lost.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.040]   God never created men sinful, as I was saying last Friday.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.760]   God never created sin.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.060]   So it is not God's desire that any should perish.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.320]   It gives him no pleasure that they do.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.200]   Quite the reverse, say these scriptures.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.000]   The desire and the pleasure are that men should turn and repent, but the fact of the matter
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.560]   is that none do.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:31.320]   And so in order to save a single soul, God has got to decide and to determine to save
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   some.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.920]   That is exactly what this whole chapter is telling us.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:42.440]   Very well, there is the first reason for this then, that he may show his long suffering
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   and his compassion.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:50.040]   He endured these vessels of wrath that were already ripe for destruction.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.640]   He did not wipe them off.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:59.240]   He bore with them, and he is doing that with the whole of humanity until this present hour.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   But then there are further reasons.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.800]   Here is the second.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:10.240]   By enduring like this, with long suffering, these vessels of wrath, God is of course at
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:15.440]   the same time rendering them quite inexcusable.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.640]   This to me is the most important argument.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:24.120]   They are inexcusable, of course, because of the offer of his grace.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.280]   Have you ever, I wonder, contemplated this question?
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:36.920]   Why was the Old Testament or the Old Dispensation period such a long one?
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.440]   Whatever your figures may be, whatever figures you accept, whether you accept as a bishop,
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.680]   archbishop, usher or not, it seems to have been at least four thousand years.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:52.080]   Why four thousand years after the fall, before the birth of our Lord and Saviour?
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.480]   Why that long interval?
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.920]   What is your answer to that question?
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:03.480]   Why do you think that God endured all that we read of in the Old Testament and you can
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.400]   read of partly in the secular history of the nations of the world?
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.240]   Well, it seems to me there is only one answer.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:17.160]   And from the beginning, he has always been self-confident.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:24.360]   That is one of the first results of the fall, man's pride, pride of intellect, pride of
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:29.480]   understanding, pride in his own power, pride in what he can achieve.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:35.400]   And man has always taken the view, as he does now, that he can save himself.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.400]   These modern people who say that a man reads the New Testament, he likes the teaching of
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:43.280]   Jesus, decides he is going to follow him, that makes him a Christian and all is well.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.920]   Very well, that is man's self-confidence.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.720]   That has always been man's trouble.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.440]   Man has always said that he could save himself if only we were told what to do.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.560]   Well, very well, God told him what to do.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.520]   He gave the law to the children of Israel.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.520]   There it is in perfection.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.520]   Others copied it.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:04.520]   Not only that, he gave the Greeks full opportunity of producing their great philosophers, elaborating
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.680]   their great teachings, drawing their blueprints of their utopias.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.120]   Here they are, they are going to put themselves and the whole world right.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.280]   Well, now, God gave them a thorough opportunity to do it.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.360]   If he had stopped it at the beginning, they would have said, "Ah, but you did not give
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.360]   us a chance.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.720]   You only gave us a year.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.440]   If you had given us ten years, we would have done it."
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.160]   And then, if he had given them ten, they would have said, "If you had given us a hundred,
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.160]   what is a hundred years?
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.720]   Then it would have been a thousand."
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.040]   Well, he gave them four thousand.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.200]   You see, they have no excuse left.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.760]   God gave the ancient world a full opportunity.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:43.560]   As Paul puts it in 1 Corinthians 1, it was when the world, by wisdom, knew not God, that
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.560]   it pleased God through the foolishness of preaching to save them that believed.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:55.760]   Greece and Rome and every other civilization had exhausted itself and had ended in failure.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.280]   And then, God sent his Son.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.560]   And now, it is exactly the same in explanation of the new disposition in which you and I
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.560]   live.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.720]   And in this long interval, well, there is only one answer.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.520]   God is going to render condemned humanity utterly speechless at the end.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.160]   They will say, "But if only we had heard about it."
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.840]   But he says, "You have heard about it.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.920]   The gospel has been preached now for nearly two thousand years.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.060]   The world is without excuse.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:28.360]   Any man who goes to hell goes to hell because he is refusing the way of salvation that is
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.040]   offered him.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.600]   Every mouth shall be stopped.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   Nobody will be able to say a word.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:42.040]   God's long suffering, giving an opportunity for men and women to hear the message, renders
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:46.040]   them finally, I say, completely and totally inexcusable.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:52.320]   Don't argue with unbelievers about election and predestination.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.880]   You argue with them about this.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.880]   Why don't they believe the gospel?
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.480]   That's the thing to argue with them about.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.000]   Why don't they believe the gospel?
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.680]   That's the problem for them.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.320]   Why do they continue in sin?
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.600]   Why do they not know that their sins are forgiven?
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.120]   Why have they not been born again?
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.120]   Why not?
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120]   Here is the offer.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.320]   Hold them face to face with that.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.160]   Render them inexcusable.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:23.280]   And thirdly and lastly this evening, God's reason for enduring with much long suffering
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:29.920]   these vessels of wrath that are already ripe for destruction, is that when the time of
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:41.200]   their punishment does come, it is made yet and still more striking.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.800]   Now we have already seen this in the case of Pharaoh in verse 17.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.920]   Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee, and
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.320]   that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.320]   Which we interpreted, you remember, like this.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.200]   That if God had destroyed Pharaoh and his hosts at the first refusal, well, we wouldn't
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.080]   have had those twelve miracles which we have.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.040]   And it is through them that God showed his power, his overwhelming power, that the whole
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:12.840]   world spoke about then and has been speaking about ever since.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.960]   And it was only when finally Pharaoh and his chariots and his hosts were drowned and consumed
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:24.280]   in the Red Sea that the greatness of God's might and glory was really shown.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:29.720]   Now he brought out this mere handful, as it were, of defenseless people and destroyed
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.320]   this mighty dictator's army and all his hosts.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.880]   When God does it, it's unmistakable.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.460]   Because you see, God has allowed these scoffers to say, "Where is the promise of his coming?"
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.760]   And that's the sort of thing they're saying at the present time.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.480]   They say, "There isn't a God at all.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.960]   If there is a God, he wouldn't endure all this.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.360]   If he could stop it, he would stop it.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.880]   If he could punish, he would punish."
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.000]   They say, "There is no God."
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.360]   God allows them to say it all.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.880]   And when they seem to have proved their case to the hilt, and when the whole world has
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:05.880]   become godless and irreligious, and is there as it was in the time when our Lord came on
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:15.440]   this earth in a sense steeped in iniquity and in foulness, God will arise.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.360]   And the coming will be still more wonderful and glorious.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:26.400]   When he is revealed, as Paul puts it there in 2 Thessalonians, with all the brightness
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:34.800]   of his glory, it will, I say, be still more wonderful and glorious for the very reason
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.920]   that it has been delayed.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:44.560]   Let me read the words to you, that we may go home with this thought in our minds.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:49.360]   He says, "We ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.360]   in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure, which is a manifest token
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.080]   of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.320]   for which you also suffer.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:05.640]   Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:11.400]   you, and to you who are troubled, rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:18.840]   heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:24.440]   and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:30.040]   destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power, when he shall
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:39.080]   come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe in that
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.080]   day."
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:53.440]   When he comes, the destruction will be correspondingly more awful than ever, when kings and others,
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.280]   as we are told in Revelation 6, shall fall down and cry to the rocks and the mountains,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:07.240]   "Fall on us and hide us from the wrath of the Lamb and the terror of his coming."
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:18.280]   There are at any rate three reasons why God, though the whole of his being urges him to
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.120]   punish the sinner, withholds that urge.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:29.960]   There is a fourth reason, and that is the one that is given in verse 23, which, God
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:35.480]   willing, we will proceed to consider next Friday evening.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.280]   Let us pray.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:48.600]   O Lord, our God, we come before thee.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:53.600]   And O Lord, we thank thee that we can come and turn unto thee, knowing that we are thy
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   people.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:03.360]   We come, O God, because we know that we are vessels of mercy.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:09.920]   We realize we would not be considering these things if we were not vessels of mercy.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:17.080]   And we can but humble ourselves before thee and bow in thy holy presence and be amazed
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.320]   that thou hast ever spared us.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:29.800]   O God, receive our praise, our thanksgiving, our worship and our adoration.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:38.080]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:44.560]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:53.040]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and evermore.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.200]   Amen.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.120]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
