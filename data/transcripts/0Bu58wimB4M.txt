[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:13.420]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, reading verses 26 and 33, and taking
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.240]   this in connection with what we read just now from the second chapter of the book of
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:26.920]   the Acts of the Apostles. John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there standeth
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.320]   one among you whom ye know not, and I knew him not. But he that sent me to baptize with
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.880]   water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:52.520]   on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And that, I say, we must take
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.520]   this morning in connection with the account given there in the second chapter of the book
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.560]   of the Acts of the Apostles of that amazing thing that happened on the day of Pentecost
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:18.400]   at Jerusalem. Now, today is Whit Sunday, and it is the anniversary of that day of Pentecost.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.520]   We are therefore considering an event which belongs to history. This is as much a part
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:34.880]   of the history as was the birth of our Lord in Bethlehem, as much history as his miracles,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:44.720]   his death upon the cross, as historical happening and event, as his literal physical resurrection
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:53.680]   in the body out of the grave, as literal effect of history as his ascension recorded in the
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.680]   first chapter of this book of the Acts of the Apostles. We therefore are commemorating,
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.880]   as I say, something that belongs solidly to the realm of history. I am emphasizing this
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.560]   because this is something that perhaps needs to be emphasized more than ever at this present
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.440]   time. We must never lose sight of the fact that our gospel and our salvation is not a
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:29.520]   mere teaching, not a mere philosophy. It is primarily a series of acts, of actions, of
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:40.240]   happenings, events, and the meaning and the purpose of those events. So we on these occasions
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:49.280]   always remind ourselves of the historicity of that which we are considering.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.560]   In other words, what we read here in this second chapter of Acts is something that literally
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.640]   happened in the way that it is described. Luke was primarily a historian, and his concern
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.280]   was to give to this man Theophilus, to whom he had already written his gospel, a further
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.880]   account of the continuing action and activity of the Lord Jesus Christ. And so he is dealing
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.560]   here with something that belongs solidly and purely to the realm of history.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.520]   Now then, what was it that happened? Well, what happened was, as the records make so
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:33.380]   plain and clear, that the early church was baptized with the Holy Ghost. You remember
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.200]   the promises with respect to that in the Old Testament. You remember how it was the great
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.320]   theme, as we have been reminded from the two verses in the first chapter of the Gospel
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.280]   According to St. John. It was the great theme, in a sense, of the preaching of John the Baptist.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.080]   I am not the Christ. I baptize with water. There is another. You do not know him. There
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.480]   was a time when I did not know him. But the one who sent me to baptize, in other words,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.160]   God, who called me and gave me my commission, he said to me, "The one on whom you shall
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.040]   see the Holy Ghost descending and remaining upon him, he is the one who shall baptize
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.200]   with the Holy Ghost." And our Lord himself repeats the same thing, and tells these people
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.600]   to stay in Jerusalem, not to go out and start upon their work to which he has already commissioned
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.320]   them, but to wait until they shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. And here in this chapter
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.560]   we read of that thing which had thus been prophesied so much, literally and actually
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.440]   taking place. Well, now the question for us is, what is the relevance of all this to us?
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.920]   What are we doing exactly? Is this merely a commemoration of something that once happened?
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.640]   Are we just looking back at a fair great fact in history? Is it just that? Or is there more
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   than that to it? Has it a greater and a deeper significance for us? Is this what we are doing,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:20.080]   I say, a purely commemorative act? Or is there another factor, something that goes beyond
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:28.280]   that? Well, now the answer to that question is determined entirely by our attitude to
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:38.960]   the doctrine concerning the baptism with the Holy Spirit. This is a most crucial matter.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.640]   Those who attend here regularly will know how crucial we regard it. We have been dealing
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.200]   with this now for many months because we regard it as the most urgent, vital, and crucial
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:58.720]   matter for the Christian Church at the present time. And it is, unfortunately, it has become
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:13.960]   a point of division with respect to the whole doctrine of the Holy Spirit and his work.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.200]   Now people who are evangelical in their outlook are agreed with one another about practically
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.240]   everything in connection with the doctrine of the person and the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.320]   apart from this one matter. They are agreed about his activity in the creation. They are
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.960]   agreed in his position in the blessed Holy Trinity. They are agreed with his operations
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.360]   upon certain men, giving them gifts to perform certain tasks, as you see it described in
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   the Old Testament, the prophets, certain men working in the temple like Basil and so on.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:57.680]   They are agreed about all that. They are agreed in his activity in connection with the Lord
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.880]   Jesus Christ himself, how he came upon him and enabled him to preach and to do his work
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:12.360]   while he was here in this world. They agree about his activity in his death and in his
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.200]   resurrection. They are agreed about the work of the Holy Spirit in convicting people of
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:25.800]   sin. They are agreed about his operation in the great and mighty act of regeneration.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.880]   They are agreed more or less in general also about his activity in sanctification. There
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.720]   is a slight difference there. But the point I am establishing is that in almost the entire
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:46.160]   range of the details of the great doctrine of the Spirit and his work, there is agreement.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:53.720]   But when you come to this matter of the baptism with the Holy Spirit, there is a divergence
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:00.440]   and a disagreement. And it is, as I say, because to me this is the most vital matter, a crucial
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:06.880]   matter, that I am calling your attention to it this morning. What is the significance
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.040]   of what happened on the day of Pentecost to us? Now, there are in the main two views with
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:19.120]   regard to this. We need not be bothered about minor deviations here and there, or minor
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:26.920]   differences. It comes to this that there are two major points of view. And I want to put
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:33.280]   the two before you in order that you may see the vital importance of this doctrine.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:42.960]   Now, the first is the view that teaches that what really happened on the day of Pentecost
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:49.560]   at Jerusalem was that the Church, the Christian Church, was born. The Christian Church came
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:09:00.080]   into being. The Christian Church was constituted and formed as the body of Christ. They have
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.000]   to admit, most of them, some don't even admit that, but most of them are ready to
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.520]   admit that these disciples were already regenerate, already born again. But they are owing to
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:19.440]   the special, peculiar circumstances that obtained then and then only. They couldn't be baptized
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.720]   with the Spirit until the day of Pentecost. So they are ready to admit that there was
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:33.320]   an interval in the case of the disciples between their regeneration and their being baptized
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:40.160]   with the Spirit. But, they say, that was solely due to the fact that there was an order in
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:48.120]   these matters, an almost dispensational order, and the order had to be observed. So, in their
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:56.040]   case, there was this interval. But here, on the day of Pentecost, they were, all of them,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:02.680]   baptized with the Holy Ghost, which means that they were baptized into the body of Christ.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.080]   The Church was formed. A unity came into being that was not there before, and so the Church
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:15.440]   as an organism, as a body, comes into being and is given the power to do the work to which
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:22.720]   she has been sent. And, of course, it follows from that that they say, with regard to this
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:30.600]   event, that it was a once-and-for-all event. It could only happen once. It did, they say,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.320]   only happen once, never to be repeated. So it is an event in and of itself, and all we
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:45.960]   can do is to look back to this unique, once-and-for-all event. Then they go on to say—there is a
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.560]   good deal of confusion in what they do say, but I am trying to give you what I would regard
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:59.840]   as the commonest view—they would say that since then, and especially since what happened
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.520]   in the household of Cornelius, as is recorded in the tenth chapter of this book of the Acts
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:14.800]   of the Apostles, the baptism with the Holy Ghost happens to everybody at regeneration.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:21.560]   When a man is regenerated, he is at the same time baptized by the Spirit into the body
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:28.280]   of Christ and becomes a part of this one body that was formed on the day of Pentecost. I
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:34.120]   say, especially since what happened in the household of Cornelius for this reason, that
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.080]   of course they are in difficulties over the people in Samaria, the account of which is
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:45.840]   given in Acts 8, and even the case of the apostle Paul. But they say in the case of
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.280]   the household of Cornelius, while Peter was yet speaking, the Spirit fell. Obviously,
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.560]   regeneration and the baptism of the Spirit happened at one and the same time.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:05.000]   They have to gloss over the case of the Ephesians, as recorded in Acts 19, verses 1 to 7. But
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.800]   in general they say, now this has become the norm. Obviously, the case of the disciples
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:16.320]   was a unique one and a special one. But now ever since, the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:24.840]   is an event which is synchronous with and practically identical with regeneration. And
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:30.480]   it means that all who are Christians are already baptized with the Holy Ghost and have become
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.720]   part and parcel of the body of Christ. So that the regenerate person is one who has
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:44.040]   received the baptism, he has received the Holy Spirit, he has received all that it is
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:52.440]   possible for a Christian to receive. All he has to do, therefore, they say, is this, is
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:13:01.480]   to go on living and walking in the Spirit. He has been baptized with the Spirit, he has
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:08.120]   been filled with the Spirit, all he has to do is to maintain that. He mustn't expect
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:14.960]   anything further. He mustn't seek anything further. He mustn't long for anything further.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:23.560]   He has received this baptism and all that it connotes there at the point of his regeneration.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:30.080]   Now they say it is possible, of course, and alas, for the Christian who thus has been
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.160]   baptized with the Spirit and filled with the Spirit, it is possible for him to fall away
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.960]   from death. He may fall into sin, he may become slack, he may backslide. And as he does so,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:48.720]   he will lose this blessing. He grieves the Spirit, he quenches the Spirit, he may offend
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.860]   the Spirit in this way. The Spirit doesn't leave him, the Spirit is still there in him.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.980]   But he has grieved the Spirit, so he is not now experiencing the gracious influences
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:05.120]   of the Spirit. What is he to do? Well, they say all that is necessary is this. He's got
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:13.360]   to realize this, he's got to repent of it, he's got to surrender himself once more,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:20.400]   and he's got to go on living a life of obedience to the Spirit that is in him. And if he does
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:27.760]   this, what he has lost will be restored unto him, and he will be able to go on his way
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:35.720]   rejoicing and happy. Now, this is what has been the prevailing and the most popular and
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.800]   common evangelical teaching with regard to the meaning of the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.280]   The Day of Pentecost, that's quite on its own, it's unique, it's separate, never
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:54.840]   to be repeated, obviously. And the Christian now is in this position. He has everything
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:02.880]   that can be desired, and it all depends now upon his yielding, his obedience, his walking
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:10.080]   in the Spirit, his allowing the Spirit to dominate his life.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:17.600]   Now there is a most important and interesting corollary to this teaching, and it's the
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:26.280]   one I want to emphasize this morning. Such a teaching rarely, if ever at all, speaks
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:37.240]   about revival. It's not interested in revival, and of course it obviously cannot be. There
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:44.200]   is no room left for revival in that teaching. Every Christian has been baptized with the
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.240]   Spirit at the point of regeneration, has had the fullness of the Spirit. Well, there's
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:55.520]   nothing more that he can receive. His future now and the future of the Church depends entirely
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:04.800]   upon his obedience, his yielding to the Spirit who remains in him in spite of his rebellion
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.680]   and disobedience. There is no room left whatsoever for revival.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.320]   And it's very interesting to notice that the people who teach this view of the baptism
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:21.720]   of the Holy Spirit never mention it. I've made a practice now for many years, whenever
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.640]   I see a book on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, which I've never seen before, the first
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.800]   thing I do is to look at the index. I look either at the synopsis or the table of contents
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:41.600]   at the beginning and the index at the end. I look for revival, and I don't find it.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:47.360]   Now I commend that to you as an interesting exercise. Look at the books on the person
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:53.400]   and the work of the Holy Spirit that have been published during this century, and look
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:01.680]   for a section, a chapter or even a part of a chapter, on the subject of revival. And
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.280]   you will not find it. It's not there. And of course, they're perfectly consistent.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:14.520]   It's been excluded. There is no possibility. There's no room left for it. It can't
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:24.760]   happen. And so you find that this is the interesting corollary of this particular view of the doctrine
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:31.120]   of the baptism with the Holy Ghost. And the result is that the activity of the Church,
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.360]   the way in which the Church has conducted herself and her outlook during this present
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:44.640]   century has been this. When things are not going too well, well, the Church doesn't
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:54.480]   exhort the people to pray for revival. She decides to have an evangelistic campaign.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:00.880]   She organizes a campaign, and then, of course, asks God to bless that. But the solution is
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.200]   an organized evangelistic campaign. And this has become the kind of pattern I think you'll
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:13.800]   all agree. People are converted in meetings, campaigns, evangelistic efforts, and there
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:19.480]   it is believed that if they believe and respond, they are born again and they are baptized
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:26.200]   with the Spirit. And all they need now is a further teaching which will tell them to
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:34.000]   go on yielding, to go on surrendering, to go on giving obedience, to go on allowing
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.600]   the Spirit who has come into them in his fullness to possess them whole. And that is the sum
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:49.880]   of evangelical teaching. Conversion, regeneration, this further teaching with regard to sanctification.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:56.680]   And you notice that the whole time the emphasis is placed upon what we do. It's all in
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:03.000]   our hands. There's nothing further to be expected. It all is a matter now of our surrendering
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.160]   and our obedience. And so the whole of the effort is put on that. Pressure is brought
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:15.000]   on the will, both in the first decision and in the subsequent surrender. Here it is. You
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.840]   and I alone determine what is going to happen. Now there's one view. But there is another
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:30.720]   view. And the other, of course, is the old evangelical view. I call it that because I'm
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.760]   speaking strictly historically. The view I've been dealing with is still not fully a hundred
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:46.080]   years old. But prior to that, and even continuing since, there is this other view, the view
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:51.960]   that is obtained in the Church throughout the centuries. What is it? Well, let me put
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:20:00.640]   it like this to you. What happened at Pentecost, according to this second teaching, is this.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.840]   That the Church was baptized with the Holy Ghost, as our Lord had promised and as the
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:14.480]   others have prophesied. What does it mean? Well, what it means is a baptism of power.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.120]   The Church was already full. Now we were dealing with this last Sunday. I just want you to
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:25.640]   see the sequence, that you may have it clearly in your mind. These men were regenerate. Our
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.800]   Lord says to them, "Now are ye clean through the word that I have spoken unto you, I pray
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.720]   for these, not for the world," and many other statements in the Gospels. Right? They were
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:40.400]   all regenerate. Then, after his resurrection, when he appears to them in the upper room,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.640]   he forms the Church, he incorporates them, he breathes the Spirit upon them, saying to
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:52.480]   them, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." Not what he said later, where he says, "You shall
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.640]   be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence." No, but as I was able to demonstrate
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:03.960]   to you last Sunday, he used an expression which meant that they were to receive it at
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.400]   that time, and they did. And the Church was formed there, and he gives it the authority
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.680]   to remit sins, and so on. Very well, here is the Church formed. Now then, on the day
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:23.400]   of Pentecost, what happens is that the Lord sends upon the Church this power to witness
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:30.720]   that he had promised. "You shall receive power." That's what happened at Pentecost.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.600]   There's nothing here about the constitution or the formation of the Church. No, no, that's
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:42.320]   already happened. What he says is, "You shall receive power." And on the day of Pentecost,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:50.120]   in the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the Church received the power. We see her before that
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:57.120]   waiting in accordance with his command, waiting constantly and instantly in prayer. And then,
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:03.280]   suddenly, on this day of Pentecost, this tremendous thing happened. There they were met together
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:10.200]   in this one place. Suddenly, there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind,
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:16.160]   and it filled all the house where they were sitting, and so on. Now, this was a baptism
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:24.640]   with power and a baptism with fire, with fire. And the thing you notice that is emphasized
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:33.400]   is this. Not some secret operation of the Spirit in the depths of the personality, but
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:41.000]   the Spirit falling upon the gathered Church, descending upon her, being poured out upon
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.200]   her. Those are the terms that are used, and that is exactly what happened. The very sound
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:53.040]   of the rushing mighty wind emphasizes this objectivity, this givenness. It isn't a
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:59.160]   secret work such as happens in regeneration. No, no, it's a power coming upon the Church,
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.960]   something happening to the assembled company. And she finds herself filled with power and
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:13.840]   authority, with certainty, and with a sense of glory. It is the action of the risen Lord.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:20.520]   God had told John the Baptist, "It is upon the one whom you will see the Holy Ghost descending
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.960]   upon and remaining upon, that's the one that's going to do this." And he is the
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.480]   one that did it. He said he was going to do it, and he did it. What happened, therefore,
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:37.920]   on the day of Pentecost was that upon the formed early Church there descends the power
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:45.000]   for ministry, the power for witness. Now then, I must ask the question that I asked
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:55.720]   in the first section, is this therefore something once and for all? And the answer is this.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:04.600]   It is once and for all in one sense only, and that is that it was the first time it
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:10.520]   ever happened. But it is not once and for all in any other sense, as I'm now going
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.960]   to try to prove to you. A thing that happens for the first time, well, you can't go
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.720]   on repeating the first time, but you can repeat what happened on the first time. It is only
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:27.020]   once and for all in the sense that it was the first time I first entered this pulpit
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:36.720]   on the last Sunday morning of the year 1935. Well, I can't repeat that, but I have repeated
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.000]   the action. I've repeated the action how many hundreds of times since. I can't repeat
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   the very first time I came here, but I do exactly the same thing. Now, it's only once
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.080]   and for all in that sense that it was the first time it happened. But it is not once
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:25:00.200]   and for all in any other sense. How do we demonstrate this? Well, we do so like this.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.360]   What we are told about those people there on the day of Pentecost was that they were
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:11.640]   all filled with the Holy Ghost. That's the term that's used. There appeared unto them
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.120]   cloven tongues like as a fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:21.720]   with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other towers and all the rest that followed.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:27.240]   But now, if you go to the fourth chapter of this same book of Acts, you will find that
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.840]   incident where Peter and John were arrested as the result of their performing of the miracle
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:38.000]   and the men who sat at the beautiful gate of the temple. And they were put on trial,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.040]   and the authorities decided that they would let them off this time. But they straightly
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:50.280]   charged them that they should do nothing further in the name of this Jesus. They called them
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:55.680]   and commended them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus. So, when they
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.520]   had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.480]   them because of the people. And then you remember, Peter and John went back to the company, to
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:11.280]   the church, and reported what had happened to them. And when the church heard this, they
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:17.280]   lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and they began to pray. And what they prayed
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   for, of course, was that God might behold the threatenings of these people. And now,
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.280]   God, behold their threatenings, and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.840]   may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:45.560]   be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. Listen. And when they had prayed, the place
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:52.960]   was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:58.800]   and they spake the word of God with boldness. Exactly the same thing as had happened on
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:07.400]   the day of Pentecost. An exact repetition. The same people. And you notice the objectivity
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:14.000]   again. The place was shaken. It's something happening outside them. They are not here
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.040]   just yielding. They had no need to. They hadn't been disobedient. They'd been very obedient.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.880]   They'd borne a wonderful witness before these authorities and powers. They'd said to them
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.560]   without any hesitation, "Whether it be right in the sight of God, I hearken unto you more
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.920]   than unto God, judge ye, for we cannot but speak of the things we have seen and heard."
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.240]   They'd witnessed with boldness, and yet they see here they need something further, and
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:46.040]   they pray, and God answers. And the place is shaken. The Spirit descends upon them.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.040]   The shaking of the building corresponds to the sound of the mighty rushing wind, and
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.840]   they're all filled with the Spirit. And the same result follows, that they spake the word
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:02.360]   of God with boldness, and later with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:08.600]   of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. It's an exact repetition of what
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.520]   happened on the day of Pentecost. And then, I mustn't keep you this morning. We've been
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.200]   over this evidence, but I'd ask you again to read for yourselves the account of what
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.000]   happened in Samaria in chapter 8. Read what happened in the household of Cornelius in
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:31.480]   chapter 10. While Peter was yet speaking, while Peter yet spake these words, the Holy
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:38.080]   Ghost fell on all them which had heard the word. We are not told that some secret action
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.640]   took place in their souls, leading to regeneration. That did happen, of course, but in addition,
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:49.320]   the Holy Ghost fell on them. And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:55.360]   as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:02.960]   of the Holy Ghost. And you remember Peter's argument. He says, "Can any man forbid water
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:09.440]   that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?" How
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:15.440]   did he know that? Well, they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Exactly the
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.840]   same thing had happened to them as had happened to the apostles and the others on the day
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.520]   of Pentecost. This is a repetition. And on and on I could take you through the evidence
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.680]   once more. Now, there is the evidence as we have it in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.960]   But look at history. And this is where the whole matter becomes to me so crucial and
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:42.000]   so vital. The history of the Church. What is the history of the Church? Well, you know
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.680]   the graph of the history of the Church is something like this. She starts up there on
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.080]   the day of Pentecost. After a while, she seems to have lost much of her power and becomes
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:57.600]   more or less ineffective. Then she rises again in power. It goes on down, it goes again up,
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.360]   and that is the graph of the history of the Church. Read your Church history for yourselves.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:13.880]   How do you explain this? Well, this is what has happened. The Church has become worldly.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:21.600]   The Church has forgotten her true nature and has forgotten her commission. The Church has
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:28.440]   absorbed a lot of Greek philosophy and a lot of Roman law. People like Constantine decide
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.720]   politically to bring the Empire into the Church because it is going to help him and pay him
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   in certain respects. And the Church becomes an institution. But what happens? Well, what
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:50.600]   happens has been something like this. Certain men become concerned and disturbed and unhappy.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:57.520]   And they say, "What we need is another baptism with this Holy Ghost. We must seek the face
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:03.280]   of God." They did everything they could. They repented, they rendered obedience, they
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:09.080]   tried to go on walking in the life of faith, a life of surrender to the Spirit. And they
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:15.880]   did so, genuinely. But nothing happened. And they went on and on like that and were almost
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:25.120]   at the point of despair when suddenly something happened, often when they least expected it,
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:35.520]   when they were on the verge of utter despair. Suddenly, upon an assembled company, the Holy
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:45.320]   Spirit falls again. It is simply wonderful to read the accounts of these events. Sometimes
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:51.880]   they have described actually hearing a sound, as if there were another rushing mighty wind.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.720]   Not always. But what does happen invariably is that they are aware of a presence and of
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.120]   a power. Something has come upon them and has happened to them. And they are lifted
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.680]   up out of themselves and out of time. They scarcely know where they are. And phenomena
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.360]   take place. I am not talking about speaking with tongues. What I am talking about is joy
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:16.280]   and a bend, sometimes so great that people even faint and cling to unconsciousness. And
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:23.520]   great power and great liberty, great authority follows in preaching. And that is what is
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:29.920]   called a revival. Now, this is what has been happening in the
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:37.040]   Church throughout the running centuries. And the thing that I am emphasizing, of course,
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:45.120]   is this, that it is always the action of God. It is not men. Men have done everything. He
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.280]   has been surrendering. He has been obedient. He has done everything. But nothing happens.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:57.160]   He may organize all nights of prayer, and every night nothing happens. And then suddenly
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:03.120]   something does happen. And nobody understands and nobody can explain it. There is only one
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.800]   explanation. It is God again. It is the one who sent the Holy Ghost on the early Church.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.200]   It is the one who sent it on that building and shook the walls. It is the God who did
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.960]   it then, who is repeating it, and who has gone on repeating it throughout the running
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.040]   centuries. My dear friends, if you read the history of the Church, you can come to only
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:29.360]   one conclusion. This has been God's way of keeping the Church alive. The Christian Church
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:37.840]   would have been dead and finished centuries ago and many times over, were it not for revival.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:43.360]   This is the true meaning of the word revival. It is God pouring out his Spirit on an assembled
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   Church or company or many Churches or countries even at a time. This has been God's way
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:54.520]   of preserving the Church. What he did at the beginning, he has done again. When the life
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:00.640]   was gone, he sent it again. When the power has vanished, he sent it again. That has been
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.880]   the history of the Christian Church from the first century until today.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   Now let me just refresh your memories by reminding you of some of the examples of this. You know,
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:21.520]   there was something like this in the second century. The Church had been absorbing Greek
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:28.040]   philosophy. She was so anxious to show that there was nothing strange about her doctrine.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:34.440]   These apologists who held sway in the second century were governed by that idea. The result
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.080]   was that the Church had become lifeless. She had lost her power. Certain people were aware
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.320]   of this. They began to seek the face of God, and God answered. I am referring to what is
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:50.000]   called mountainism. I know there were excesses. I know that they went wrong at certain points.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.120]   But at any rate, the Church was alive again, and there was power in the Church. One of
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:59.760]   the greatest intellects and brains of the whole history of the Church, Tertullian, entered
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.240]   into this movement when he saw that that was New Testament as over and against the formal
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.720]   dead Church.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:14.080]   You had another example of it in North Africa in the third century, the Donatist movement.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:20.320]   Same thing, a rebellion against formality, the formality that had come in when Constantine
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:27.480]   and the Roman Empire came into Christianity. It was denounced, of course. The Church always
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.960]   denounces every revival. The mountainists and the Donatists were both condemned by the
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.320]   Church, as the Methodists were condemned two hundred years ago, and as people who are filled
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:44.880]   with the Spirit are almost invariably condemned by a dead formal Church.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:53.440]   And then you get into the Middle Ages. Here and there, amidst odd people, God visits them
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:59.320]   and blesses them. There were revivals in the south of France in the Middle Ages, revivals
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:05.840]   in connection with the Waldensian Church in northern Italy, revivals amongst the brethren
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.960]   of the common life in Germany and parts of Holland, all this prior to the Reformation,
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:18.400]   then the Great Reformation itself. Undoubtedly, there was a revival. A man like Hugh Latimer,
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:24.240]   who used to preach at St. Paul's Tross, was a man clearly filled with the Spirit and preached
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.960]   in an apostolic manner. And there were others.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:32.840]   Then in the seventeenth century, there were remarkable movements, local revivals in Northern
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:38.560]   Ireland and in parts of Scotland. I have reminded you already of that tremendous thing that
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:44.800]   happened at Kirk of Shots, when John Livingstone was preaching and just preached that one sermon
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:50.920]   which led to the conversion of so many. The Spirit came down upon them. A repetition of
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.920]   Pentecost.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:59.000]   And, of course, everybody knows about the eighteenth century in the United States and
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.400]   in this country. That revival that broke out in Northampton under the ministry of Jonathan
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:13.840]   Edwards, that soaring genius. Read his account of it. He wrote a narrative, an account of
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.280]   that revival. Read it, my friends, and then you will know what a revival is. It is the
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.240]   Spirit coming upon, not men controlling and just deciding to yield and to give obedience.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:30.520]   No, no. People have done that and still nothing happened. Then God does something. God sends
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.360]   down his Spirit. God visits them. That is revival.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:41.720]   And of course, exactly the same happened in this country under the ministry of Whitefield
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:47.320]   and the Westleys. It happened in Wales under Daniel Rowland, Howard Harris. And in each
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:53.800]   case, keep your eye on the objectivity. How suddenly, when nobody was expecting it, Daniel
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:59.400]   Rowland, for instance, had been in trouble for months. He had believed the truth at last.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.680]   He had been in the ministry without believing it, but now he sees it. And he was trying
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:08.720]   to preach justification by faith. And still he said he did not feel it. But there he was
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.840]   one Sunday morning in a communion service in his little church, and actually reading
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:20.800]   the liturgy in connection with the communion service, and he came to the words about Christ's
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:27.040]   precious blood. He was actually reading it out of the book. As he was reading it, the
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:33.360]   Holy Ghost fell upon him and upon the church. He wept, he broke down. A revival broke out.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.760]   That was in 1735, and it continued for a number of years. Then there was a lull from about
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:46.000]   1750 to 1762. He was still a great preacher and still occasional converts, but there was
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.680]   no life and power such as they had known. But at the end of 1762, and still more in
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   1763, God again sent a great baptism upon them. Oh, time would fail me to tell you these
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:07.400]   things. But look at last century, the nineteenth century. Have you ever read of the great revival
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:16.200]   in the United States which began in 1857 and went on to 1859? Have you read of that little
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:21.880]   prayer meeting that the men began in Fulton Street in New York City? They went on praying
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:26.600]   for months and nothing happened. They did all the surrendering that they were capable
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:33.960]   of. Nothing happened. But then it did happen. God! It's always God. It's always pouring
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:39.840]   forth. It's always shedding abroad. It's always falling upon. And that was one of the
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.800]   greatest revivals in the whole history of the Christian Church. But it wasn't confined.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:53.400]   Began in Ulster in 1858, began in Wales in 1859, and went right through the country.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:59.240]   Amazing, astonishing. You can read these accounts for yourselves. You won't get them in books,
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.800]   as I say, written on the Holy Spirit in the twentieth century. But you read the books
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.960]   of the nineteenth century, the eighteenth, and you'll find they're there. And buy a
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:14.160]   book like that of Sprague on the history of revivals. And then in 1904 and 5, same thing
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:21.920]   again in Wales. 1906 in Korea, still more recently within the last twelve years in the
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:28.760]   Congo, several revivals have happened in the island of Lewis, not only the one connected
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.640]   with the name of the Rev. Duncan Campbell, but before that, revivals. This has been the
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:39.360]   story of the Christian Church throughout the running centuries. And all this I am suggesting
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:47.640]   to you is a repetition of Pentecost. The Church waiting, God sending down his Spirit upon
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:53.240]   the Church. Now, you see the importance of this doctrine of the baptism with the Holy
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:41:02.640]   Ghost. It is the second teaching alone that holds out any hope for us this morning. Here's
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:09.800]   the lesson for us. What is the Church to do? Well, of course, she should go on yielding
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:15.680]   and obeying, she should do all that. But, oh, if we had to stop at that, I would despair.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:22.160]   I'd be without hope. I know men, I know individual ministers who have been teaching
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.680]   this for twenty years and more, trying to get their people to do it, persuading their
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:31.120]   people to do it. They've obeyed, they've sacrificed, they've surrendered, they've
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.160]   had special prayer meetings every morning at seven o'clock. It's been going on for
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:43.520]   years. But nothing has happened so far. And, you see, if it all depends upon us, what hope
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:50.400]   is there? But the message of the day of Pentecost is this, that what God has done, God can still
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:59.240]   do. This is something that God has gone on repeating throughout the running centuries.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:06.920]   And what the Church needs to do is to realize her weakness, her impotence, that the power
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:15.680]   is always of God and not of man. There is nothing so fatal as the reliance upon man's
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:22.000]   ability to deal with the situation of the Church. The first step is to realize that
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:29.240]   man, having done everything, has in a sense done nothing. Oh, yes, he can produce a number
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:34.000]   of converts. Thank God for that. And that goes on regularly in evangelical churches
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:45.640]   every Sunday. But the need today is much too great for that. The need today is for an authority
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:55.440]   and an authentication of God, of the supernatural, of the spiritual, of the eternal. And this
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:06.640]   can only be answered by God graciously hearing our cry and shedding forth again his Spirit
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:13.400]   upon us and filling us as he kept on filling the early Church. Here are men filled on the
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:19.040]   day of Pentecost, again a day or two later, the building shaken and the filling again,
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:24.400]   and God has gone on filling the Church in revival. That is, I say, the greatest need
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:29.720]   and that is our only hope this morning. But you see, you have got to believe in the possibility
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:38.160]   of that. If your adoption of the Holy Spirit does not leave any room for revival, well,
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:43.320]   then you cannot expect this kind of thing. If you say the baptism of the Spirit was once
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:50.120]   and for all on Pentecost and all who are regenerative are just made partakers of that, there is
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:55.840]   no room left for this objective coming, this repetition, this falling of the Holy Ghost
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:02.360]   in power and authority upon a Church. There is no room left. But thank God there is room
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:09.640]   left. The teaching of the Scripture plus the long history of the Christian Church shows
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:15.680]   this so clearly and that you and I are called upon this morning not only to believe this
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:22.960]   but to pray to God without ceasing for it, to ask him to open the windows of heaven and
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:34.360]   to send down the Spirit to pour him upon us, that he may fall upon us in mighty power.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:40.640]   And here is to me the great encouragement. I have told you how in Fulton Street in New
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:46.480]   York just one man began to pray at first and then two or three joined him. And then more
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.360]   and more came until they had to move to a bigger building and they went on praying for
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:55.040]   months and God answered. The story in Northern Ireland was this. There was a very simple
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:01.200]   labourer, working men, called James McWilkin. He began to pray alone. Then he persuaded
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.840]   a friend of his to join him, just two men, and they prayed in a little schoolroom for
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:10.200]   months, just the two of them. But then others began to pray and on and on they went and
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:17.240]   at last God heard and answered. And so it has been.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:23.360]   There has always been this preliminary period when just one man or two men or a group of
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:32.280]   men, realizing the truth of this doctrine, have turned to God and have started pleading
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:44.280]   and praying urgently and without ceasing. And then suddenly in a prayer meeting perhaps
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:56.840]   or in a preaching service or anywhere, God suddenly sends down the Spirit. He comes again.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:01.360]   Sometimes he comes almost again as a mighty rushing wind. I do not know whether I have
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.960]   reminded you before, but if you like to read the autobiography of Dr. Andrew Murray of
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:10.800]   South Africa, you will read there his account of a revival in one of the churches where
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.080]   he ministered. He was presiding at a prayer meeting and he says that he literally heard
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:22.800]   a noise, a sound, a kind of rumbling, and it came nearer and nearer. It was the outbreak
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.880]   of the revival in that church.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:36.240]   But there is not always the noise, but there is always the sense of glory. There is always
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:45.200]   the sense of awe, the sense of the majesty of God. There is always a sense of power.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:57.000]   There is always an assurance of salvation. It always leads to great joy. And it always
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:05.400]   gives boldness in witness, whether from a pulpit or in private. It always gives a convicting
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.360]   and a converting power.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:13.800]   What happens always is that the believers are revived. Revival can only happen to a
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:22.120]   man who has got life. It means revivifying. The church has lost her power. She is given
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:27.600]   the power again. He gave the power at the beginning. He goes on repeating, giving the
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:34.440]   power. That is revival. And God has kept his church alive and going by this succession
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.160]   of revivals throughout the running century.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:44.200]   To me, as I said at the very beginning, to me there is nothing that is more urgently
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:53.520]   important than this. Do you believe in revival, my friend? Are you praying for revival? What
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:48:02.480]   are you trusting? Are you trusting the organizing power of the church? Or are you trusting in
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:13.000]   the power of God to pour out his Spirit upon us again, to revive us, to baptize us anew
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.960]   and afresh with his most blessed Holy Spirit?
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:26.760]   The church needs another Pentecost. Every revival is a repetition of Pentecost. And
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:35.160]   it is the greatest need of the Christian church at this present hour. Oh, may God open the
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:47.880]   eyes of our understanding on this vital matter, that we may look to him and wait upon him
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:49:00.760]   in his infinite mercy and compassion. He sends down from on high once more the power of the
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:05.400]   Holy Ghost upon us. Amen.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.480]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
