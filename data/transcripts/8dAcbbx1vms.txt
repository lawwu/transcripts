[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   what to do on the very first day
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.700]   on your journey from disorganized to organized.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.100]   So it's the day one steps I want to focus on today.
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.200]   My plan is I have five steps to go through.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.200]   The first four steps are highly technical.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.800]   What to do in the first four to six hours on the quest to become.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.000]   A more organized person, the fifth step will then give you
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   the maintenance activities to do for the 30 days to follow to make sure
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.300]   that everything you do this first day actually sticks.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.900]   So this is not about having the most advanced ongoing system,
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.400]   but instead taking the biggest possible steps on the very first day.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.200]   Before we get into those details, though, let's start by briefly discussing
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.000]   the psychological obstacle that we have to get past
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.600]   before we can hope to succeed in this quest to become more organized.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.300]   Here is what I think the main problem is that people have is a misperception
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.400]   about the reality of their workload.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.500]   So I'm actually, again, with great trepidation,
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.000]   going to draw a picture here for those who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.600]   I want to draw a picture about how most people think about their work day.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.900]   This is just sort of implicitly in their mind.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.200]   So we have here a very happy stick figure.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.900]   And he's sitting, I don't know, he's sitting at his desk.
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.700]   And there we go.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.000]   You know, he's sitting here at his computer, expertly drawn.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.500]   So let's draw a little computer here.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.200]   Perfect perspective.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.400]   All right. So there he is, happy at his computer.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.100]   Because in the in the world of the way most people just sort of imagine
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.500]   their work is, what's going on?
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.700]   Well, there's maybe a couple phone messages to return.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.900]   I have three little phone messages over here.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900]   And there's, you know, two projects.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.300]   Somebody choose one of these projects to make progress on.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.000]   And there's like a few phone messages that you might want to return.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.400]   And in fact, our happy person here, I'm going to give them a notebook.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.500]   And in this notebook, they, with colored pencils,
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.900]   kind of have this like nice little plan for the day.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.300]   Work on project A, and then return these calls,
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.700]   and go for a nice walk, and then take lunch.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.700]   Like this is sort of the implicit assumption people have
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.500]   about what their work life is like.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.600]   I have some stuff I'm working on, some things I have to get back to people.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.900]   All right, what's the reality?
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.300]   Well, I'm going to draw a picture of what I imagine,
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.600]   this is what I think the reality is for most people.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.700]   So what I have here is our same person,
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.700]   now very unhappy, running as fast as he or she can,
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.600]   because there is a giant cloud of an overwhelming quantity
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.000]   of projects, and requests, and tasks, and things that people need from them.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.100]   And it's chasing him or her.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.500]   I'm going to say, or, you know, let's do, for whatever reason,
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.800]   it's shooting lightning bolts at this person.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.200]   Huge cloud chasing after the running person, there's lightning bolts.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.300]   For some reason, things are on fire,
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.200]   because I don't know, that's kind of what it feels like.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.900]   So there's just flames everywhere.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.100]   This is the reality, all right?
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.800]   What people think, oh, I use my colored pencil,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.900]   so that I can differentiate my phone call
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.900]   from when I work with a nice cup of tea on project A.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.200]   Reality, running from fire,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.500]   as there's this giant swarm chases after you,
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.900]   firing lightning bolts at you.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.000]   All right, why is it important that we have this misconception?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.700]   It's because when you think, it works not so bad,
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.600]   two things happen.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.200]   One, you don't think you really need to do much to get more organized.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   Like work is not that hard.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.800]   I just need to, you know, maybe draw out a to-do list
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.200]   in a nice format, be a little bit careful,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.100]   or just buy, like I bought this nice,
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.800]   this nice looking, you know, Japanese paper planner online,
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.200]   and just, we'll write it.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   It's gonna make our lives a little easier.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.700]   You don't see the urgency of actually taking major action.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.200]   The second issue that's generated by this misconception
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.900]   is that if you do begin wandering
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.000]   towards some more systematic organization,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.400]   it's you open the door to this reality,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.200]   and my God, it's so terrible,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.700]   that you just slam that door shut and say,
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.900]   let's just pretend that doesn't exist, denial.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.700]   I don't wanna confront the reality of how much stuff is going on.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.500]   Here's the thing though, and this is the first step
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.000]   of the five steps I wanna talk about today.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   The very first step on your very first day of becoming organized
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.800]   is preparing yourself to face this reality.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.400]   So it is a psychological preparation step.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.700]   There is a term of art that I used to use
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.200]   in the early days of this show,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.100]   and that was called facing the productivity dragon.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.000]   And the idea behind facing the productivity dragon
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.600]   is that you confront the reality of everything
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.200]   that is on your plate,
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.100]   even if it is terrifying and overwhelming
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.300]   and shooting lightning bolts at you
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.100]   and lighting the world around you on fire.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.700]   It is better to confront the reality
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.400]   than to pretend it doesn't exist.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.200]   So step one is to prepare to face this productivity dragon.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.500]   Now, this is not a new idea.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.900]   If we go back to the sort of OG of digital age productivity,
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.000]   that is David Allen, he wrote about what was involved
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.300]   in trying to get your arms around for the first time,
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.400]   the step of getting started on being organized.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.100]   He wrote very clearly in his 2001 classic,
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.800]   Getting Things Done, how much is involved
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.700]   in taking that first step from chaos towards calm.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.700]   I'm gonna read you from chapter five of his book here.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.100]   Here's a short excerpt.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.900]   Just gathering a few more things than you currently have
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.700]   will probably create positive feelings for you.
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.700]   But if you can hang in there
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.400]   and really do the whole collection process 100%,
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   it will change your experience dramatically
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.200]   and give you an important new reference point
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.800]   for being on top of your work.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.600]   When I coach a client through this process,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   the collection phase usually takes between one and six hours,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.100]   though it did once take all of 20 hours with one person.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.700]   All right, so what Allen is teaching us here
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.000]   is this very first step
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.500]   of confronting the productivity dragon takes time.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.900]   It takes hours, 'cause there is more in there
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.500]   than you probably want to admit.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.800]   So the concrete advice that comes out of this first step
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   is that you need to put aside a full day for this day, right?
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.200]   When I say, what do you do the first day
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   of becoming more organized?
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   I don't mean here's something you can do
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   for 30 minutes in the morning
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.200]   and then you'll be more organized.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.700]   You actually are gonna need a full day to do this right.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.800]   So you could take, put aside a day that was otherwise quiet
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.600]   or put aside a weekend day or a vacation day if you need to.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.900]   We have plenty of those coming up.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.900]   But you need to prepare yourself
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.500]   that you're gonna need something like a full day
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.300]   to actually make the transition
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.100]   I'm gonna talk about right now from chaos to calm.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.700]   All right, step two, let's get technical.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.000]   You need to set up your first storage system.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.100]   The place that is going to gather and make sense
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.600]   of all of these things that you actually have to do.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.300]   Now, if you go back and read David Allen,
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.300]   one of the things you're gonna notice
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.100]   is that he relies a lot on a embodied physicality
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.700]   in the obligations in people's lives.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.500]   So he sort of imagines that many of the obligations
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.700]   in people's lives have a physical embodiment.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.400]   There's a receipt that has to be submitted.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.500]   There's a phone slip for a call that has to be returned.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.800]   There's a printed report that was given to you
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.500]   that you have to do your revisions on.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.500]   And so his process of collection from getting things done
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.400]   is all about having these physical inboxes, literal boxes.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.100]   And you're going around your space
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.500]   and collecting these artifacts
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.800]   and putting them into these inboxes.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.500]   You're building piles of your stuff.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.600]   And for the small number of things
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.100]   that don't actually exist in the real world,
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.600]   he says you write down a pointer to it
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.500]   and put that piece of paper in the physical box.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.800]   So it's a very physical process.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.000]   I'm gonna suggest something different.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.700]   I think that the difference between the late '90s
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.900]   and early 2000s when Allen was putting together
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.100]   this methodology and now in the 2020s
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.400]   is that the vast majority of professional obligations
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.700]   in your life as a knowledge worker are digital.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.100]   Very few of them are embodied.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.400]   Maybe you printed something,
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.600]   but the thing you printed has a digital counterpart
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.800]   for which it began.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.000]   Most stuff is actually implicitly in an email somewhere.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.800]   It's a request that was in a Slack.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.000]   It's an appointment that's lurking on your digital calendar
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.500]   for which work has to be done.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.900]   So to try to translate now
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.500]   that the vast majority of our obligations are digital,
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.900]   to try to somehow translate those into the physical world
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.300]   to gather them back into the digital would be inefficient.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.300]   So our storage systems, we're gonna start digital
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.000]   and we're gonna remain digital, all right?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   So no physical inboxes.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.900]   What is gonna be the digital system
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.700]   in which we're going to store everything?
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.500]   It's gonna require three things, a collection of lists,
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.900]   the ability to rapidly add, update,
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.500]   or move items between these lists,
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.600]   and the ability to efficiently append information
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.800]   such as links or notes or texts copied out of emails
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.700]   to individual items on these lists.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.800]   These are the three capabilities we're gonna need
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.400]   in our storage system.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.000]   This clearly is gonna have to be digital.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.100]   You're not gonna be able to get all of those features
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.600]   in a purely analog system,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.800]   the quickly moving things with back and forth,
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.500]   appending information to things.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.900]   So we're gonna need a digital system here
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.100]   that can satisfy those three things.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.200]   I'm gonna give you three options here
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.100]   from simple to most complex.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.600]   The simplest way to implement a system
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.700]   that has those three properties
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.900]   would just be with word processing or text files.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.900]   So just imagine you have a text file.
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.300]   You can just have a bold header for each of the lists
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.600]   that we're gonna define and then just write below it,
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.900]   separated by white space, different items of the list.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.200]   If you want to append information to an item
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.800]   in this particular implementation,
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.200]   you can just put a bullet point
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.300]   or a collection of bullet points under the item
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.000]   and just copy and paste whatever information you need.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.100]   It doesn't have to be neat.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.300]   So you could just get going
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.900]   with Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.500]   Any number of online task programs
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.400]   let you do this easily as well.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.200]   A favorite of mine is WorkFlowy.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.900]   All it is is list that you can indent.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.300]   Press Enter, you get another item,
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.800]   press Tab, it indents over.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.000]   What's nice about this is you can hide indentations.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.200]   So if you have a bunch of things,
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.600]   extra information or a task,
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.300]   you can click Assign to have it all collapse
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.700]   and then you can just open it again
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.400]   when you want that information.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.000]   So for our three properties, text files will be fine.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.900]   Next more complicated solution for implementing this system
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.800]   is gonna be something like Trello.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.900]   This is what I use.
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.800]   It's just very well set up for what we're talking about here.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.000]   Each list can be a column on a Trello board.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.400]   Each item can be a card on a Trello board.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.800]   Extra information can be appended to the back of the cards
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.500]   and the cards are easy to move back and forth
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.500]   between different columns.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.000]   The more advanced solution would be
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.900]   to build something more custom,
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.700]   perhaps using a task view database system like Notion.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.400]   I would not start here
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.500]   for your very first day of becoming organized
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.800]   unless you're already a pro at one of these systems
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.300]   and it's as easy for you to put together
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.000]   as it is for someone else to set up WorkFlowy.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.600]   This is the type of thing you can think about down the line.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.900]   Once we've made this initial leap from chaos to control,
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.500]   chaos to calm, down the line,
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.700]   you might think about if you're more tech oriented,
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.000]   building a more advanced system,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.300]   but I wouldn't start there.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.500]   Okay, so we now know what a system, broadly speaking,
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.600]   needs these lists that you can update
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.400]   and move stuff between and append information.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.000]   We know what tech tools you can use
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   to actually store these lists.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   What are the actual lists we need in our initial system?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.600]   I'm gonna suggest six for your starter system.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.800]   Again, whether this is in Docs, Trello, or Notion.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   Ready, Backburner, Waiting, To Discuss,
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:27.500]   Clarify, and Scheduled.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.800]   So in fact, I'll even write these on the screen
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.900]   so we can be on the same page.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.400]   I'm gonna talk a little bit about each of these.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.700]   I always try to type on here, Jesse,
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.200]   but it always just creates,
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.400]   makes the world just fall apart.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.100]   By the way, see that issue with the trying to type on here?
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.100]   That's why I had to stop using this in my classroom.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.900]   When you're in projection or screen sharing mode
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.300]   in Notability, the text does,
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.300]   the typing doesn't work very well.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.300]   All right, I can just write though.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.600]   I got beautiful handwriting.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.700]   All right, so what are these things?
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.300]   Ready was number one.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.900]   What we mean by ready is going to be,
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.600]   think of it as like ready for action.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.700]   These are things, items that need to be worked on
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.100]   as soon as we can get to them.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.800]   I typically think about something under a ready list
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.600]   as something that I want to try to complete
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.200]   in the given week.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   Different people do that slightly different ways.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.700]   Next, we had Backburner.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.400]   These are things that they need to get done.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.200]   You've committed to them,
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.400]   but you're not working on them right now.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.800]   So we have them on the Backburner.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.100]   So we're not gonna forget about them.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.400]   We have a place and here it is on this list.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.300]   If we get more information about this thing
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.800]   that we've committed to, but it's not coming up yet,
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.900]   we have a place to put that information.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.900]   Someone emails us more details
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.700]   about the workshop we've agreed to set up,
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.200]   and we're not really working on that yet.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.800]   We can copy that text from the email
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.400]   and put it on the back of this Trello card
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.100]   or an indentation under this item.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.100]   So that's what's going on the Backburner.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.800]   Waiting, this is critical.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.900]   I think this is the most important type of list
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.500]   that people do not typically keep.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.200]   This is things that you are waiting to hear back about.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.400]   All right, so this is I'm working on this workshop.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   I sent an email to the administrator
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.000]   about trying to get a room reservation.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.800]   I am waiting to hear back from that person
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.600]   about whether or not we can get that room.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.100]   That item can be now under the waiting list.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.800]   So it's waiting as in waiting to hear back.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.600]   Other critical lists that most people don't use
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.600]   in their systems but is very efficient is to discuss.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.100]   So it's where you keep track of things
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.100]   where I'm going to be meeting with this person or team
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.300]   at some point in the near future.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.400]   What do I want to discuss with them at that next meeting?
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.900]   Now you have two options here.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.600]   You can just have one list to discuss
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.500]   and every item on it, the very first thing
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.500]   in the title of the item in bold is to discuss with Jesse.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.800]   So like you can just, you can clarify for each item
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800]   who is this for?
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.200]   So it's for people or teams you meet with
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   on a regular basis.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   And the idea here is if you have things
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.300]   you need more information on,
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.900]   instead of just throwing an email into the ether,
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.200]   you can kind of collect lists of,
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.500]   okay, next time I talk to Jesse,
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.900]   I have four things on here to go through.
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.700]   If there's people you have a lot of things
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.000]   to discuss things with
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.700]   and you talk to them on a regular basis,
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.100]   they can get their own to discuss lists.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.000]   You might have multiple to discuss lists
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.400]   with team, with boss, with department chair.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.700]   That's fine as well.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.500]   Clarify, these are placeholders.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.100]   All right, I have this obligation,
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.800]   something I'm supposed to do something about this.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.700]   I don't yet know what that means.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.800]   In other words, like I don't know
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.400]   what I should do right now to make progress on this thing.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.600]   I just know I'm committed to it.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.200]   I need to think through or learn more
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.500]   about what this actually means.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.500]   You know, I said, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.200]   I'll handle the secret Santa in the office this week
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   or this month.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.900]   And I don't really know what that means.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.000]   Like, I don't know how that works
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.900]   or what I need to do,
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.800]   but I just committed to it.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.600]   I don't wanna forget it.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.400]   It can go to the clarify list.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.200]   That means this is an obligation
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.900]   that is pending more clarification
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.800]   on what it actually is gonna require us to do.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.300]   So we have a place for it.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.600]   And then scheduled.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.000]   So if there's a non-simple task
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.100]   that is scheduled on your calendar.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.200]   So it's a task that requires some explanation
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.900]   or maybe has some information that gets appended to it.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.400]   Here's what people emailed me.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.700]   Here's the list of steps I need to do on this.
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.500]   I'm supposed to file this report.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.600]   I put aside time to do this on Friday morning,
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.500]   but here's the step.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.100]   Someone told me about how to do this
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.100]   or how to submit it.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.400]   This gives you a place for that item
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.300]   to live in your system.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.500]   So all that information can live somewhere.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.600]   So a item under scheduled
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.400]   is also on your calendar somewhere.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.900]   But the item on your list
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.400]   can hold all the extra information you need.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.700]   Not everything on your calendar
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.400]   needs to be under the scheduled item.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.400]   You don't need appointments
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.600]   for the most part under there.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.100]   You don't need small things under there.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.600]   You know, pickup, whatever,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.900]   someone from the train station.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.800]   You know, you probably don't need an item there.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.500]   But if it's complex,
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.400]   there's information you need to remember about it.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.700]   Then it can live there under the scheduled item.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.200]   All right, so you have six lists.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.400]   And that's your initial collection system.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.300]   So we've set up six lists
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.600]   in some sort of digital system.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.000]   All right, step three.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.300]   Here's the facing the productivity
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.300]   drag and part made real.
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.000]   Dump everything on your mind,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.800]   in your inbox, in the world.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.100]   Everything that you are obligated to do
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.100]   gets on these lists.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.500]   All right, so what does this mean?
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.500]   Everything you can think of.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.500]   So just start, like, what can I think of
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.600]   that I'm supposed to be working on
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.200]   or I should be doing?
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.600]   Maybe I told someone I would do it
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.900]   or I've just been thinking to myself,
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.800]   this is something I should make progress on.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.500]   I should update the website.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.200]   Get everything you can out of your head.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.800]   Get it onto an item in these lists.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.000]   Go through your inbox and process every single email.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.400]   Get the inbox empty.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.800]   This doesn't mean reply to every email.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.700]   This doesn't mean take care of every email.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.400]   You're translating these emails into task items
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.500]   that go into your system.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.200]   So for this initial collection phase,
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.000]   you wanna clear everything out of your inbox.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.100]   And it might mean you might have things
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.200]   showing up on your list.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.600]   It's just, like, reply to send Jesse the information
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.300]   he requested about skeleton manufacturing, right?
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.900]   Like, just whatever it is,
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.200]   you're just translating emails into items on this list.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.000]   But you are denying your email inbox
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.400]   to be a secondary task management system at this point.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.600]   You're putting all your faith into this collection system.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.600]   Look through your calendar.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.200]   There are complicated things on there,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.800]   reminders that should be translated
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.200]   into tasks that are on this list.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.400]   Then go back and think some more
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.600]   about what else am I forgetting?
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.500]   What else is just in my head?
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.500]   Let me give you a couple advanced tips
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.600]   for going through this collection process.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.700]   Number one, it does help sometimes
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.900]   to use a working memory.txt file
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.400]   as an intermediary in this process.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.400]   So just have a plain, unformatted text file
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.700]   on your computer.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.300]   As you're going through one of these categories,
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.300]   you can just dump things into that text file
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.800]   and then go from that text file into your system.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.500]   It helps, right?
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.800]   It feels like this is an extra step,
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.700]   but it actually helps,
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.300]   especially if you're cleaning out an inbox.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.100]   'Cause you can type really quickly into a text file
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.300]   and you don't have to be organized
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.300]   or really think it through,
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.400]   like reply to Jesse about this,
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.800]   send back dates to so-and-so.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   You can just type really fast
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.700]   and just fill in this text file really fast.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.700]   I call it working memory.txt
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.300]   because this text file is like an extension
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.600]   of your working memory.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.200]   Our brain can hold five or six things at a time.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.800]   With a working memory.txt file,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.100]   you can have 20 or 30 things.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.200]   It's like you're extending your working memory.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.600]   And then you go from that text file into your system.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.800]   It takes a little bit more time
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.000]   to put things into your system.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   You have to choose the list.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.300]   You have to create the card
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.300]   or do the font formatting
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.400]   if you're using something like Microsoft Word.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.200]   More importantly, as you go from this very fast
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.400]   to fill in plain text file to your system,
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.500]   you see things to consolidate or to simplify.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.300]   Eh, actually I don't really need to respond to these people.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.600]   Or now that I look at this,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.600]   I have eight different emails on here from Jesse
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.400]   about merchandising Jesse Skeleton.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.200]   I could just combine this into one item on my list,
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.200]   which is, you know, set up intervention
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.800]   to talk to Jesse about his obsession with Jesse Skeleton, right?
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.900]   So you actually get some on-the-fly organization
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.900]   and consolidation simplification
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.400]   as you go to this extended working memory
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.100]   and then into your system.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.100]   Advanced tip number two,
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.800]   when you're going through this initial dumping
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.000]   of everything in your life into this system,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.200]   lean heavily into the clarify list.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   Don't try to work everything out during this process.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.100]   There's too many things.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.800]   Don't try for everything you come up with,
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.400]   like, well, what's going on with this project?
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.300]   Well, let me follow up with so-and-so about this.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.700]   And let me go, let me look at this a little bit.
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.800]   When might I be able to do this?
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.200]   You don't have the time or energy
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.900]   to actually clarify all of the ambiguous obligations
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:10.500]   that are on your plate.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.000]   Right now, we're just trying to get everything
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.300]   into our system.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.500]   So at first, your clarify list might be really long.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.900]   You just don't want to forget it.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.900]   So you just have, you know, workshop plan.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.000]   It's like, God, I don't even know what that means,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.100]   but I'm not forgetting it.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.900]   Let me just throw it in the clarify list for now.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.500]   We'll deal with this in the next step.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.700]   So don't worry about that.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.300]   The key rule to maintain
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.700]   as you're initially populating your list in your system,
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.300]   and this is the rule that you should maintain going forward,
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:41.200]   is that every obligation gets one item in the system.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.500]   It can move between lists.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.200]   It cannot exist on multiple lists.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.600]   You do not have, okay, under ready, workshop,
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.300]   you know, next steps for this workshop project.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.300]   And then if that generates an email to an administrator,
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.700]   you don't keep that item under the ready list
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.500]   and add a new item to the waiting to hear back list.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.400]   You move that full item over to the ready,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.600]   waiting to hear back from list
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.500]   and just update the status up top.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.800]   I'm waiting to hear back from so-and-so about this.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   All of the information about a given obligation
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.600]   lives in the system,
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.500]   but it moves around to what is the status
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.100]   of this obligation right now.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.200]   So think about these lists
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.700]   as the statuses of various obligations.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.600]   If you are actually building a notion-based system
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.600]   to keep track of this stuff,
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.200]   this would be a lot more explicit
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.100]   because these are database entries
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.300]   that can have a single status.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.200]   It's here, then it's there, then it's here.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.000]   So everything just lives in one place.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.400]   All right, this will take a while,
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   one to three hours probably.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.000]   So we've really spent a lot of our day here
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.400]   getting everything into this list.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.700]   But now symbolically when you're done,
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.600]   everything is captured.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.400]   Your inbox is empty.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.700]   There's nothing in your head.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.100]   There's nothing just sitting there on your calendar.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:55.900]   You don't know what it means.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.300]   It's all in this one place,
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.700]   this collection of lists, this system of yours.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.900]   That brings us to step four
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.500]   to do your initial configuring.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.400]   Moving forward, configuration of your list,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.700]   of your system is something you're gonna do
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.800]   on a semi-regular basis.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   We'll get to that soon.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.700]   But we're gonna do our very first configuration step
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.900]   during this very first day
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.000]   that you're making your leap from chaos to calm.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.500]   This is a big thing that was always missing
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.900]   from David Allen's methodology,
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.400]   but I think is really important.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.900]   This is where you make sense
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.000]   of all of the things in your system
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   and you clarify and optimize, remove redundancies.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.700]   It's where you sit and move and work around
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.100]   and make more sense of this huge mess of stuff
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   that's on your plate.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.800]   So this means a few things.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.700]   One, start going through your clarifying,
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.100]   the items under the clarify list
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.500]   and try to clarify as many as you can.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.300]   The stuff that's not particularly urgent,
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.200]   you can skip for now.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.700]   But the things you think like,
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.900]   I need to do something about this.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.100]   Now you can clarify it.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.000]   So you don't want to clarify
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.600]   as you're filling in your list
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.000]   and doing your dumping everything in your life
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.700]   because that's too much friction.
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.700]   But now that you've done that,
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.400]   now we can focus just on moving through this clarify list
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.700]   and say, what are the things that really
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.800]   I should be making progress on
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.300]   and start doing the clarification.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.200]   Now this might mean you discard it.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.500]   I don't really need to do this.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.300]   Or it might mean you're sending a clarification email.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.000]   This is often the case with stuff that ends up on clarifying
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   when you go through a configuration step.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.900]   Often the reaction is,
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.300]   I got to write to someone to say,
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.100]   what the hell does this mean?
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.000]   Like, how do I set up the Secret Santa?
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.600]   You did it last year.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.500]   Can you tell me about it?
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.300]   That's fine.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.400]   So those things just get moved over
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.200]   to the waiting to hear back from list.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.600]   Other things, it might be obvious.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.400]   Now that I think about it,
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.300]   what I need to do is set up a meeting with my team
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.700]   and we need to make a plan.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.700]   So either I can send that doodle pool now to do that
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.900]   or move this over to the ready list
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.200]   and change the actual description of the item
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   to set up meeting with team to discuss this project
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.600]   and all the information about it is attached to this card.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.200]   This is what I mean by clarify.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.100]   So it's moving things off of that clarify list
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.100]   to where they should go.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.000]   This is also a good time to triage.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.800]   Go through and triage the back burner.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.000]   Do I really need to do this?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.700]   I was excited about this,
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.900]   but I'm thinking now I don't need to do that, right?
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.900]   So you can kind of go through like what's on the back burner.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.700]   Let me triage things out of this.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.600]   What do I really want to stick with?
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.900]   This is where you might send some sorry triage messages.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.900]   Hey, you know, sorry.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.400]   I know I said before like I could help you with this,
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.200]   but actually I think my schedule is too crowded.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.700]   That creates like seven seconds of annoyance
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.100]   on the recipient's end,
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.300]   but for the sender of that email,
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.300]   it can create seven hours of freedom.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.400]   So those are very powerful.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.900]   Whenever I get those type of messages from someone,
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.400]   not right before something is due or after it's due.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   Hey, I didn't do this.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.500]   I can't really get to this, but like three weeks in advance.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.700]   Hey, you know how I said we should record this thing.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.400]   Honestly, like I don't, I was misreading my schedule.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.000]   This is probably not the right time for it.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.900]   I know that someone who has their act together.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.100]   That's someone who's looking
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.100]   and configuring their whole schedule
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.100]   and seeing what makes sense and what doesn't.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.300]   You'll actually earn respect if in advance,
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.200]   you're stepping back from things.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.000]   Now, if you wait until it's due and just don't do it
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.400]   and then step back, that's a different thing.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.000]   Then you look out of control.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.600]   Another part of configuring is adding things to calendars
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.800]   that need to be on calendars.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   Okay, this is pretty urgent.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.900]   Let me find time for this and get that on my calendar.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.600]   If there's information associated with this task,
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.200]   I'll move this over to scheduled.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.900]   If it's a one-time thing like set up doc dentist appointment
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.300]   and I get it on my calendar, then, you know,
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.000]   I just delete the item from my list.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.400]   I don't need it there.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.500]   It's also a good time.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.200]   And this is an advanced tip
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.000]   to look for batching opportunities.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.700]   Like this, this, this, and this.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.000]   All of these things I could really make progress on
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.900]   if I talk to Jesse about them.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.300]   So what I really want to do is take all of these five things
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.900]   and put them all on the back of my Trello card
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:00.200]   for the item of set up meeting with Jesse
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.400]   to discuss many things.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.500]   And you kind of have these things below.
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.300]   And then I send the email to Jesse saying,
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.200]   "Let's do this meeting."
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.200]   And that whole card gets moved to waiting to hear back from.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.000]   Or I'm like, "Oh, we meet every week
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.400]   when we record our podcasts.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.800]   Let me batch a bunch of these things
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.300]   and put it under the to discuss list,
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.900]   Jesse's to discuss list, right?"
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.100]   So it's in this configuring step
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.600]   you get all these great batching opportunities.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.800]   Let's wait to do this here.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.000]   Let's do all these things at the same time.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.300]   Let's, I'm going into work on Friday.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.100]   And so like, let's put aside a big group of time
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.900]   and we're going to like squash through 20 things
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.700]   that need to get done.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.000]   This is really productivity ninja stuff
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.100]   when you begin to do these batching opportunities,
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.700]   something that really doesn't happen
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.300]   when you're just reactive and chaotic.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.000]   "Oh my God, what do I need to do next?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.300]   My inbox is on fire.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.500]   Oh my God, this thing is due."
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.100]   You're never going to see those types of opportunities.
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.300]   All right, so at this point,
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.400]   you have your system fully set up.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.700]   We're about four or five hours
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.300]   into your first day of trying to be more organized
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.500]   and you have everything
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.500]   in a intelligently designed digital system
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.500]   in these six optimal lists.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.300]   And you've done your initial configuring.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.500]   So stuff that's important has been clarified.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.000]   You've batched stuff, you've removed stuff,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.300]   you've moved things where it needs to go.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.700]   Some things are on the calendar.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.900]   So you kind of have your arms around what's on your plate.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.000]   The fifth and final step is how do we then make
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.500]   the use of this system stick?
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.400]   If you stop trusting this system,
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.900]   it will fall apart.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.800]   If you find yourself unwilling, for example,
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   to move something out of your inbox
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.300]   and onto an item in these lists,
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.000]   that means you don't trust yourself for this system.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   It means you say, "I know I'll check my inbox."
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.300]   'Cause I get yelled at if I don't.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.900]   I don't trust myself to look at this system.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.400]   So let me just keep this in here.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.100]   If you're writing notes to yourself,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.300]   you're not trusting your system.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.300]   So how do we actually get you into the habit now
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.800]   of actually making this system part of your workflow?
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.000]   Well, I'm going to suggest two things you do daily
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.600]   and one thing you do weekly for the next four weeks
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   after this very first day of getting organized.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.900]   So the first daily thing,
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.100]   review this system every morning
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.900]   when you look at your calendar.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.100]   Use it to help make your plan for the day.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.300]   I won't even get into now
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.600]   how you're making your plan for the day.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.800]   This is more advanced stuff.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.600]   But however you make your plan for the day,
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.300]   and again, the brightly colored pencils
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.600]   on your fancy planner,
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.800]   or you're just jotting stuff down on a text file,
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   I don't care for now.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.600]   I look at my system every day before I make this plan.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.100]   I see what's on that ready list.
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.500]   I remind myself who am I waiting to hear back from.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.100]   I remind myself on the to-discuss list.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.600]   Hey, do I have a meeting coming up today
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.700]   that I need to discuss things on a to-discuss list?
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.800]   We're talking five minutes, but you see it all.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.900]   You see the mess of stuff
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.600]   and clarify that you haven't got to.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.400]   You see the big back burner.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.300]   You see everything.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:51.100]   Number two, at the end of every day,
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.400]   when you're finishing the shutting down your work,
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.400]   you have to go back and review the system again.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.600]   Here, the goal is to make sure that anything
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.500]   that is floating gets nailed down back into the system.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:04.300]   Oh yeah, you know, I said in this meeting I would do this.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.600]   Let me make sure that's written down in my system.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.800]   This thing came in, this request in a Slack.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   Let me get that into my system.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.000]   You're closing the loops,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.500]   making sure that there's nothing just in your head.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.800]   Should you at this point empty everything
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.500]   in your inbox into your system like we did on the day one?
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.600]   It's probably not practical
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.000]   because it just is too time consuming.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.200]   You might not always have that time.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.700]   So let's put that aside for now.
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.700]   But otherwise, anything else that's loose or urgent,
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.100]   you want it in your system.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.000]   You look at your system,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   make sure there's no obvious changes or updates to do.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.700]   Typically, if the day moves fast,
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.200]   there's updates you need to make to your system
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.000]   you haven't gotten around to.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.400]   Oh, I sent that email about this.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.500]   I need to move that over to waiting to hear back.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.200]   Or I heard back from this thing,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.300]   so I need to move this back from waiting to hear back.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.900]   To over here and then copying what I heard about it.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.400]   So just do that final cleanup.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.900]   So your system, everything is back in it
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.800]   and the system is up to date.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.300]   Do that every day, first four weeks.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.100]   The weekly thing I want you to do
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.600]   for the first four weeks
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.900]   is return to that step four configure step
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.300]   at the beginning of each week for the next four weeks.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.200]   Do it Monday morning, you can do it Sunday.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.700]   Some people do it at the end of day Friday,
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.400]   so they can go into their weekend less stressed.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.800]   I don't care when you do it,
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.100]   but go back and do something like that configure step,
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.300]   which remember meant you're going through the clarify items
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.200]   and trying to like, okay,
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   which ones can I actually make progress on?
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.000]   You're triaging, you're batching,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.400]   you're moving things, your calendar are off.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.100]   This is like a 30 minute process
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.600]   of just getting the system fully up to speed.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.700]   Critically, when you do that configure process,
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.100]   this is a time to return to your inbox and empty it.
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.400]   That's why it's good to do on the weekend
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.300]   or before the week really gets going.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.200]   The stuff that's piled up to my inbox
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.000]   that I didn't really have time during the days
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.900]   or my daily reviews to get to,
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.600]   I wanna get that back down to zero
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.100]   and everything back into my system.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.000]   So it's a more thorough configuring
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.100]   than what you're doing at the end of each day.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.600]   So the book has four myths of attention span.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.000]   So four things that we think is true
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.600]   about attention, but are not.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.700]   That's what Jason's asking about.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.500]   So let's go through these one by one.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.300]   And then I'll tell you whether or not I agree or not
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.300]   that this is a myth.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.000]   All right, glorious first myth.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.100]   We should always strive to be focused
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.500]   and should feel guilty if we can't or can't be.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.600]   Yeah, I completely agree with that that's a myth.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.500]   To strive to always be focused is absurd.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.900]   It's like talking to someone who wants to get stronger
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.000]   or an athlete and be like,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.200]   you should strive to always have your muscles
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.500]   like in a state of load-bearing strain.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.400]   That's crazy, right?
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.300]   There's only so much load-bearing strain you can do
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.600]   like modern bodybuilding orthodoxy says,
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.700]   really you wanna have eight to 10 sets per week
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.800]   per muscle group, right?
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.400]   Like otherwise it's overload.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.900]   So just because you need to know how to put hard strain
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.300]   on your muscle and do it on a regular basis to get stronger,
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:02.200]   it is obviously a reducto ad absurdum to then say,
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.800]   therefore it is good to always have
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.000]   your muscles under strain.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.400]   Same thing with attention, focus is important.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.000]   You need the focus to produce things of true value
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.500]   using your brain, but to then extrapolate from that
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.600]   to say you should always be in a state of focus is absurd
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.900]   because that's impossible.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.340]   So I agree, that's definitely a myth.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.300]   All right, Gloria, second myth.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.400]   Mindless activity that we do on our computers and phones
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.600]   is wasteful of our time.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.500]   No, I agree here as well.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.900]   I'm gonna draw from my book "Digital Minimalism"
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:34.900]   to tell you what I believe.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.500]   So the whole premise of that book,
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.700]   like why did I write that book?
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:43.700]   Not because I believe there is some intrinsic evil
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.200]   in particular activities,
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.000]   but because my readers and listeners were reporting to me,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.900]   I am spending more time on these activities
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.200]   than I know is useful or healthy.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.900]   This is when distractions become a problem.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.900]   When you know they are keeping you away
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.300]   from things that are more important,
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.800]   that they are lowering the quality of your life.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.400]   That's when you say this is a problem.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.500]   And that was the problem people began feeling
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.400]   around 2016, 2017.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.900]   This tipping point where more and more people
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.500]   who bought their iPhone in 2010
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.100]   because they saw the Steve Jobs speech
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:21.300]   about having your iPod and your phone combined,
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.300]   like that's awesome,
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.800]   woke up seven years later and said,
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.500]   "I checked this 150 times a day.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.100]   "I'm not paying attention to my kids.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.600]   "I'm not socializing anymore.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.700]   "I feel strung out and anxious.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.800]   "I'm not doing the activities that used to matter."
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.000]   That's the problem.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.000]   So there's nothing intrinsic,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   "This is evil to look at it."
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.600]   It's, "I can't help but look at this
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.700]   "when I'm trying to do bath time with my kids."
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.300]   That's when it becomes a problem.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.800]   Good analogy here would be something like alcohol.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.600]   Right, same thing.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.200]   It's not, "Hey, you should never touch alcohol.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.500]   "That's bad."
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.900]   But what's the cliche about it?
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.100]   When does it become a problem?
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.100]   When it's messing up your life.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.700]   And I think that's what happened for a lot of people
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.400]   with their relationship with their phones.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.400]   So yes, you wanna measure technology from your values.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.800]   "Is it helping or preventing me
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.700]   "from doing the things I care about?"
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.100]   So it's perfectly fine to have perfectly distracting,
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.800]   low-quality things in your life,
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.100]   as long as it's not having a footprint
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.700]   that keeps you away from things that you value.
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.600]   Problem is for a lot of people, they do.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.800]   And then the real problem becomes when we look at kids,
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.900]   because they can't help it.
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.300]   I'm yet to find a 13-year-old
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.900]   who you give unrestricted access
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.700]   to the internet with on their phone,
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.400]   and they're like, "I'm gonna use this a little bit.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.600]   "I wanna go outside and play."
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.700]   Nah, if you're a kid,
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.400]   that thing is gonna brain worm in there.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.000]   So we gotta, there we have to have some more protection.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.700]   All right, but so far I'm on track here with Gloria.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.200]   All right, myth number three.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.500]   "The inability to focus on our devices
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.000]   "are due primarily to notifications
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   "and our lack of discipline."
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   That's an interesting one.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.100]   I agree with the notifications piece.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.600]   That's like 2003 thinking.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.300]   Notifications are the problem.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.900]   I get the notification that I have a new email,
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.000]   and that's the problem.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.400]   And if I just turn off my notifications, I'll be fine.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.200]   No, that's crazy.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.100]   We come back to these things again and again,
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.600]   not because we were notified,
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.100]   but because what they're offering us,
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.700]   whether we were notified or not.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.500]   And it is a complicated picture.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.500]   When it comes to work,
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.100]   you can turn off your email notifications,
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.500]   but you're still gonna check that inbox
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.400]   once every six minutes.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.400]   Why?
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.600]   Because of the hyperactive hive mind mode of collaboration.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.400]   This is the core of my book, "A World Without Email."
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.600]   We work out so much of our collaboration
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.400]   through asynchronous back and forth messaging.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.300]   These conversations required many back and forth messages.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.100]   They're timely.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.300]   So now I have to keep checking my inbox
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.600]   so that I can see your most recent message
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   and bounce it back to you
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.600]   so you can bounce it back to me
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   and I can bounce it back to you
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.100]   and get an answer before lunchtime.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.200]   So we check our work email all the time in this example,
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   not because of notifications,
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.900]   but because we have a collaboration method
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.100]   that requires us to constantly check this work email
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:07.900]   because that's how we keep
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.600]   these asynchronous conversations going.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.500]   On our phones, it's more complicated.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.000]   I don't go back to Twitter compulsively
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   if I have a problem with Twitter because of a notification,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.500]   but because of what it gives me.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.400]   It presses these emotional buttons.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.600]   There's an addictive design element to it.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.500]   I don't need a notification to grab a cigarette
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.800]   if I'm addicted to smoking.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.000]   It's already wormed its way into my rhythms of the day.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.700]   So yeah, notifications have nothing to do with it.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.100]   Discipline is complicated.
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.000]   Often directly speaking, it's not discipline.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.400]   I can't just fix my email problem by being disciplined.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.900]   I'm not going to check my email.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.800]   The whole structure of my work requires me to do it.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.600]   So I have to put in place
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.200]   an alternative structure collaboration
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.900]   that does not require email.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.400]   A little bit harder when it comes to your phone
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.400]   and in some ways a little bit easier.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.000]   Yes, I agree, just white knuckling it.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.700]   I don't want to look at these digital cigarettes is hard
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.700]   because they're helping you paper over voids in your life.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.400]   They're giving you emotional stimulation.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.800]   They're scratching deeply human urges you have
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.000]   in a very superficial way,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.400]   but you need to scratch those urges.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.500]   And it's easier to be seeing something on social media
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.600]   or like pornography than it is to actually fulfill
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.900]   those human urges with like real relationships
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.700]   with real people.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:24.400]   But there is a discipline aspect to that as well,
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.600]   but it's just indirect.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.700]   It's the disciplined construction
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.200]   of a more intentional cultivated deep life
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.000]   that begins to make the superficial pleasures
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.100]   of the attention economy superficial and optional.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.500]   It's that disciplined effort to actually build
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.100]   into your life what really matters to get a taste for it
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.900]   that makes the digitized junk food no longer appealing.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.000]   So ultimately discipline will be involved,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.500]   especially with the non-work digital life,
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.800]   but it's not the obvious discipline of just avert my eyes
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.300]   and grip my knuckles.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.700]   It's a more indirectly subtle relentlessly applied discipline
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:08.200]   to build a life where you don't just avoid those things,
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.100]   but you find them increasingly intolerable.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:13.200]   So look at that like I 80% agree.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.700]   Number four, fourth myth flow is the ideal state.
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.600]   We should strive for when using our technologies.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.100]   Yeah, I agree flow state be wary.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.400]   It's overrated.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.700]   We have this argument a lot flow state feels great
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.000]   and there are certain times in work
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.200]   where flow state feels great for example,
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   but also there's a lot of important work activities
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.500]   that are not a flow state.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.600]   It's pulling teeth.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.200]   Why because you're straining your brain to do something
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.800]   that is past your comfortable ability,
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.500]   which is critical if you want to get better
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.100]   produce your best work flow state requires
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.500]   that you get you fall into a zone which requires
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.300]   that you're like right in this sweet spot of like
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.100]   I have to focus but I can do this pretty well.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.900]   For the guitar player flow state is
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.400]   when you're playing a hard song you can play.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   Well, it's great.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.200]   You get lost in it.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.900]   Your fingers are doing it deliberate practice is
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.100]   when you were learning that song in the first place
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.700]   and you couldn't play it fast enough
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:08.300]   and that feels like the opposite of flow you feel every second
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:11.600]   when you're trying to with your full concentration do
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   something you cannot yet do comfortably so flow states great,
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.800]   but it's not the be all end all goal when it comes
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.900]   to Technologies Gloria's right be very wary,
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.300]   especially addictive video games want you to get
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.400]   into a flow state because you look up seven hours later
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.600]   and you've been focusing on that thing all day long.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.400]   They want to just pull you from one experience to another.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.200]   There's no more purified example of a flow state
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.300]   than the tick-tock interface swipe swipe swipe swipe,
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.900]   you know, just here's something here's something
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.800]   that's not good.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.100]   That was really good.
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.700]   This one wasn't but if I swipe some more I should get
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.000]   some more they get you lost in this flow state.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:48.600]   So there you go.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   They've just gathered three hours of data on you.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.300]   So Gloria's right in technology use flow states,
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.800]   not the goal in work in general flow states are great,
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.500]   but they're not the only thing that's good.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.300]   So I think we sometimes we probably sometimes put too
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.600]   much popular emphasis on them.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.500]   And by the way, my Haley checks hit me high would agree
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.200]   with this right?
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.500]   I mean he he studied these very specifically the context
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.500]   of psychology. He wasn't saying you should be in a flow
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.100]   state all the time.
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.000]   He said there's a very observable thing.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.500]   It's important and we can measure it and we should
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.100]   understand it but people took it and said flow states
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:22.900]   all that matters.
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.000]   So some wisdom in those.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.800]   So thank you who asked this question Jason good question
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:33.200]   was a chance to go over Gloria's four myths and I recommend
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.600]   that book attention span.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.100]   If you read my book world without email.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.900]   I have a whole long section on Gloria mark.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.000]   I talked about her her whole story.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.600]   I've interviewed her on multiple occasions really one
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.100]   of the top thinkers on attention and distraction.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.000]   So definitely check out that book if you're a fan of
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   what we talked about here.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.500]   I work in data analysis and I'm regularly bored in my
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.300]   day-to-day tasks at the same time.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.500]   My side hustle has gotten to the point where I can spend
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.700]   the whole day and deep work without distraction.
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.800]   What should I do in the intern to maintain my deep work
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.700]   muscle while also getting through the day?
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.300]   Just if you've gotten used to this type of question,
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.800]   we get the I call it the leading the witness question,
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.000]   right where it's like, well, my work is bad and it's
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.800]   really boring and it's stupid and but this other thing
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.300]   is really great and it's awesome and I could do it all
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.000]   day long and I gives me meaning in life.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.700]   What should I do?
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.600]   It's a leading leading the question.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.100]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.400]   So I want you to be careful here.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.900]   This is Maggie.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.900]   I want you to be wary of grasses greener syndrome.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.200]   So when you're just sort of going through your professional
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.900]   life with what in my book so good they can't ignore you.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.100]   I call the passion mindset, which is what is this job
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:46.700]   offering me?
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.000]   You're very susceptible to the grasses greener syndrome,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.500]   which is like I don't love like what I'm doing day-to-day
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.300]   right now.
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.600]   Maybe there's something where I would love what I'm doing
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.100]   day-to-day more and when you start messing around with
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.800]   side hustles, this gets even more dangerous because it
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:07.400]   is easy to create a quote-unquote side hustle that just
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.800]   like lets you do the thing you think is fun in the moment,
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.200]   right?
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.900]   Because when you don't have to depend on that side hustle
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.300]   for all of your income when you don't have to you know,
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.500]   depend on that side hustle to actually create an impact
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.100]   in the world or support people.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.600]   You can just make it whatever you want and then you tell
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.900]   yourself the story that like there's jobs like this out
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.900]   here. I could just be doing this really fun thing.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.000]   But over here on this other world in this non, you know
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.400]   data analysis there's you know, I have to fill out memos
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.700]   and it's not always like that.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.200]   My boss is kind of annoying and it's not always interesting
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:38.700]   what I'm doing.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.000]   But in my side hustle, I'm writing a novel and it's like
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.200]   fun. I'm just writing all day.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.300]   But the issue is that side hustle could just be you
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.000]   cosplaying some sort of imaginary ideal of what work
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   could be. It's a dangerous thing to have pulling you.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.300]   So how do we get out of this situation?
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.200]   It's not just we say we'll just grin and bear whatever
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.400]   your job is because maybe your job isn't in its current
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.300]   state what it should be.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:04.400]   The way you get out of this situation is lifestyle
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.400]   centric career planning.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.800]   I have an ideal vision of where I want my life to be
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.200]   and here's my sort of target in the next few years all
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.600]   the aspects of my life where I live what I do what my
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.500]   days are like my engagement with community and the rest
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:16.900]   of the world.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:20.100]   All these things are really clear and as part of this
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.300]   you then look back and say how does I use my working
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.900]   life to get me closer there then what you were doing
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.900]   in your working life is part of a intentional plan to
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.300]   get you closer to a more idealized version of your
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.700]   lifestyle that is much more effective than just the
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.800]   passion mindset of do I like what I'm doing?
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.200]   Is there another thing I could be doing that I would
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.700]   like more maybe I should just be a novelist because
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.500]   this is fun.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:46.800]   Like Cal I bought my hipster keyboard and it clickety
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.500]   clacks and and I'm drinking coffee and clickety clacky
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.900]   Brad Stolberg, by the way, Jesse called my new keyboard
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.000]   a hipster keyboard.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.100]   All right.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.900]   Yeah, he's like us you got one of those hipster keyboard
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.400]   does he seem a lot in coffee shops?
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.300]   I don't know.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:00.900]   I don't know.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.000]   He lives in Asheville.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.500]   I've is probably a lot of hipsters there, right?
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.800]   So I understand but yeah, so he calls it a hipster
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.100]   keyboard which it is.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:07.800]   So you like this is fun.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.900]   I clickety clack and wear a beret and a pipe in
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.900]   Starbucks, which is exactly what I do.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.300]   I'm just like ha ha ha right, right, right.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.800]   Anyway, this is fun and data.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:16.900]   Now.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.000]   This is the other stuff is kind, you know, it's annoying
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.300]   right? You're just going to get drawn into that.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.400]   But if you're like no, no, this data analysis job.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.600]   Is part of like the money it generates what I'm doing
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.800]   now, but where I want to shift my position here eventually
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.700]   as I get to this level, I'm going to shift this to a
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.300]   consultant because I've saved this much money and then
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.400]   it's going to be six months on six months off which
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.200]   is going to allow us like you have this plan worked
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.000]   out that the work you're doing now and what you're
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.100]   working towards with your work is part of a plan that
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.700]   connects to deeply with what resonates that's where
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.200]   you want to be not just analyzing this your day-to-day
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.000]   activity something you enjoy or not and then inventing
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.400]   you know, this ideal job cosplay like well, I'm comparing
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.100]   it to that.
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.000]   You know, couldn't be that it's equivalent of like
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.800]   you're looking at your romantic partner and then
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.700]   you're watching.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:07.200]   A Ryan Reynolds movie and you're like Ryan Reynolds
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.500]   seems kind of better.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:09.600]   I mean, he's funny.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.000]   He's like pretty good shape, you know, he's like the
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.500]   handyman in this small town in this Christmas movie
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.800]   that like I didn't realize would teach me the meaning
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.600]   of Christmas and then you know, you look over at your
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.000]   romantic partner like I don't know.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.600]   I mean, maybe he's probably Ryan Reynolds.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.300]   It's kind of the same thing when you're, you know,
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.300]   cosplaying on your hipster keyboard like this is more
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.300]   fun than you know, my job that's sending my kids to
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:33.900]   private school.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.700]   So I think working backwards and I know I'm a broken
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.800]   record on this but Lifestyle Center career planning
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.900]   gives you focus on what you're doing and why which
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.800]   is what you need to keep moving your motivational
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.200]   system needs an understanding of what you're doing
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.500]   and how it leads to something important so that
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.600]   your episodic future thinking can see something
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.500]   that really resonates.
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.300]   That's what it needs.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.500]   It doesn't need to enjoy every minute of what you're
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:57.800]   doing.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.000]   That's the wrong metric the athlete who really wants
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.900]   to be the best in their field does not enjoy all the
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.700]   time they spend in the weight room, but they're
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:08.900]   motivated to do it because it's part of their vision
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:09.700]   of being number one.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.900]   So that would be my advice there.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.300]   Be careful.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.500]   A grass is greener syndrome.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.000]   All right.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:15.700]   What's our next question?
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.200]   Jesse is the moment of truth to it's just slow
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.200]   productivity corner.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.000]   Yeah, let's get some theme music.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:30.700]   All right.
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.600]   What is our slow productivity corner question of
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:32.900]   the day?
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.100]   Jesse that came from Kieran.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:35.600]   Thank you.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.000]   Kieran.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.400]   I'm a slow thinker, but at times my employee wants
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.000]   complicated answers quickly.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.500]   I struggle at times to gather my thoughts into
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.500]   concise answers to appease management.
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.300]   How should I compensate?
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.300]   Well, I'm going to give you a couple ideas here.
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.500]   One of them will be concrete and one of them is
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.000]   going to be a little bit more psychological.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Let me start with the concrete lean into your
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:47:59.900]   slowness here.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:05.200]   By cultivating this could be like a a quirky
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.900]   idiosyncratic trait of yours.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.300]   You get that email.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.100]   Hey Dante, what about like whatever you say?
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.300]   Interesting question.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.400]   Let me give this a let me give this a thought.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.500]   I'll get back to you after lunch.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.300]   You have a specific time that then gives you enough
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.900]   time to sit down and say, okay, let me take a break.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.100]   We take a beat.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.300]   And let me think through like what do I really want
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.100]   to say here and let me gather some points here and
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.600]   actually make this pretty thoughtful and then send
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.300]   it back by the time.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.600]   I said it was going to send it back.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.000]   So then people think like well Dante.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.700]   Yeah, he's very thoughtful guy.
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:44.000]   Like he never responds right off the cuff in the
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.500]   meetings.
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.400]   He says, let me get back to you and then he does
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.500]   and he gets back to us in the time.
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.400]   He says and it's always really thoughtful stuff.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.400]   And now you're leaning into the slowness instead
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.500]   of losing opportunities.
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.300]   Like I like Dante doesn't he gives us doesn't get
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   back to us or it's it's it's incomplete.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.400]   They're like this is just the way this guy operates.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.600]   That's actually kind of cool.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.000]   He's careful so we can kind of trust him on careful
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:05.400]   stuff.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.700]   And here's the bonus Dante.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.300]   They will maybe start leaving you out of this sort
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.700]   of knucklehead like back and forth hyperactive
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.200]   hive mind.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.900]   Like let's just like go back and forth 70 emails
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:15.500]   right now and try to like get some answer.
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:16.800]   You don't really want to be a part of that.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.200]   Anyways, like I'm slower.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.900]   So no, I can't do the less than 70 emails next 30
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.300]   minutes, but I can really help think what's really
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.200]   going to be best for this client to do this.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.100]   You really have to deliver though really do think
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.300]   through and be deliberate.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.700]   Here's my psychological answer.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.400]   So that's like what you could do positively.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.900]   There could be a negative aspect here as well.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.300]   There could be some combination of perfectionism
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.700]   and imposter syndrome self-confidence issues going
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:42.200]   on here.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.500]   Right?
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.400]   So the other thing that might be happening is you
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.800]   just worried about shooting off a response because
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.500]   you worry I'm insufficient.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.800]   Like this might not be smart.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.300]   This might not make sense.
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.100]   If I send off this response too quick and I really
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.100]   haven't thought about it.
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.800]   The boss is going to be like, aha, I knew it.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   You're not smart.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.200]   You're an imposter pack up and get out of here.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:09.300]   And so you're crippled by this idea of you know,
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.700]   I just do I really belong here?
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.800]   Can you know, are people going to think I'm dumb?
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.300]   It's sort of like a perfectionism imposter syndrome.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.400]   That's also very common in these sort of work scenarios
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.500]   and there you have to just basically this is psychological
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.500]   you have to harness your sort of inner American white
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.900]   maleness of just I will be very confident like, yeah,
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.500]   I know about this there, you know, and just be like
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.300]   it'll work out.
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:36.900]   You got to have to kind of get that mindset a little
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.200]   bit. It's going to feel artificial at first.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.900]   That's sort of like, yeah, of course do this course,
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.500]   you know, then high-five people because that's what
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.400]   American white males do.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.400]   I suppose we high-five each other.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.900]   Yeah, they type on hipster keyboard.
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.600]   It's like, let me just knock this out on my hipster
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   keyboard. Give it up just round of high-fives.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.200]   Everyone in the room is just high-fiving.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.700]   So you got some that's just mindset people.
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:02.200]   Here's the thing.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.700]   People are not scouring over your responses.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.600]   They're not looking at him in detail.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.800]   There's not a committee.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.100]   That's like, okay, here comes Dante.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.600]   Let's put it up project it projected on the board
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.100]   for some reason.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.800]   They have it on a 1980 style plastic film on the overhead
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.100]   projector and they're all staring at it and thinking
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:21.800]   about it.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.200]   And then finally like someone in a tweed jacket shakes
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.000]   their head and says now this is not good.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.200]   This is not good at all.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.000]   And then the other guy is like, so we're going to murder
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.600]   him like else do it and they all just run out of the
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.300]   room to come get you.
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.500]   That's not what happens when you send a quick email.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.300]   It's mainly just people who are really busy and
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.000]   overwhelmed and just try to throw things.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.200]   I didn't answer this because I have so many things
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:41.500]   going on.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.500]   I'm super stressed it.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.700]   They don't really care.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.700]   If you read most people's emails in the hyperactive
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:50.600]   hive mind situation, they often sound like you have
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.200]   you know, a caveman who's dealing with a brain injury
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.300]   responding, you know, like it's like a meme client
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:59.000]   meeting bad 4 p.m.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.600]   Question mark emoji, right?
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.000]   Like it's people are just throwing junk around.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.900]   So the psychological answer is like you got a little
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:05.900]   easier on yourself.
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.000]   Just be like, yeah, it's fine.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.200]   They're not people just the conversation needs to
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:10.800]   move forward.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.900]   So you have some combination of these two options.
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.900]   Don't be so worried about people scrutinizing your
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:19.100]   responses or and this could be complimentary lean
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.000]   into being a slow thinker.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:20.900]   I'll use my thing.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.200]   I take my time, but then I give you good responses.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.500]   I like this this second this ladder response just
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:31.100]   because I think it might free you from a lot of the
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.500]   back and forth hyperactive nonsense and in a way
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:37.500]   that's not costing you we don't involve Dante and
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.900]   like a lot some of the back and forth nonsense because
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.300]   not because he's not reliable but because he's a slower
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.400]   more careful thinker.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.500]   So you probably won't respond to this right away.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.700]   And in fact the fact that you are you will respond
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.100]   this right away makes me think why aren't you more
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:50.600]   like Dante?
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.900]   So it's like a positive way to actually get away from
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.900]   some knucklehead stuff.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.200]   Hey, if you like this video, I think you'll really
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.800]   like this one as well.
