[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   here's a hack. I don't know if it's a hack. I find it useful as a hack. If there's some
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.040]   recurring thing you pay for, whether it's, you know, a monthly bill is easy, but even
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.080]   like a thing you buy at the grocery store every week, annualize it, right? So if there's
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.480]   something, if you're spending an extra 10 bucks a week at the grocery store on something,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.640]   something's 10 bucks more than the other thing, that's actually 500 bucks a year, right? And
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.000]   I find saying, is this worth an extra 500 bucks a year to me feels different than is
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.560]   this worth an extra 10 bucks to me every time. So like that's a sort of behavioral hack,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.320]   right? It's a way of framing things that helps me spend less, frankly.
