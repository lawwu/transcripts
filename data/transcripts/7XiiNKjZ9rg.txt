[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   [silence]
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.700]   Today, it's really simple.
[00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.540]   Nicotine only binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.180]   and there are a bunch of different ones
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.740]   on a bunch of different tissues.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.500]   And the differences in those receptors
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.220]   dictate what sorts of effects
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.940]   the nicotine will have on those tissues.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.580]   So let's talk about what those effects are.
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.020]   And let's do that by dividing the effects of nicotine
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.640]   into effects on the brain.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.180]   So everything from the neck up and on the body,
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.640]   the so-called central nervous system and the periphery.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.080]   Although I want to point out that your spinal cord
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.280]   is part of the central nervous system.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.880]   So in fairness to the reality,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.920]   your brain and spinal cord are all central nervous system.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.420]   Everything else is considered the periphery.
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.440]   Now there are a lot of different
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.240]   nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.800]   but for those of you that want to know,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.280]   you aficionados or if you're ultra curious about this,
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.060]   the main effects of nicotine in the brain
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.800]   are mediated by nicotine binding
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.280]   to the so-called alpha-4 beta-2 receptor.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.640]   Alpha-4 beta-2 receptor.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.080]   Even if you don't care about receptor subtypes,
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.960]   that's going to come up later when we discuss
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.880]   why nicotine suppresses appetite.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.200]   In fact, one of the major reasons
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.480]   why people don't want to quit smoking,
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.080]   or they quit smoking or another form of ingesting nicotine,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.640]   and then they relapse,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.600]   they go back to smoking or ingesting nicotine
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.560]   in some other way,
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.360]   is because indeed nicotine will increase metabolism
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.740]   and reduce hunger in large part
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.400]   by binding to this alpha-4 beta-2 receptor
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.480]   in a particular area of the brain.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.600]   We're going to return to that in a little bit,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.560]   but if you've ever heard that nicotine kills the appetite,
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.000]   indeed it does.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.600]   It's not the behavior of smoking itself.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.240]   It's not because you always have a cigarette in your mouth
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.560]   that you're not eating more food,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.760]   although I suppose that might be a minor effect.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.040]   There are direct effects of nicotine on both appetite,
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.480]   that is it reduces appetite,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.240]   and direct effects on metabolism,
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.520]   that is it increases metabolism through its effects
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.120]   on some other areas of the brain and body
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.400]   we'll talk about in a moment.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.740]   And within the brain,
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.740]   nicotine binds to this alpha-4 beta-2 receptor
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.420]   in various locations in the brain.
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.740]   And there are three and maybe a fourth
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.940]   that we'll talk about neurochemical effects of nicotine
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.060]   after you ingest it.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.180]   First things first,
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.660]   when you ingest nicotine by smoking,
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.880]   nicotine containing tobacco,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.380]   or if you place tobacco in contact with the mucosal lining
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.700]   of the nasal passages of the mouth,
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.920]   takes about two to 15 minutes
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.380]   for that nicotine to enter the bloodstream.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.400]   Smoking hits the bloodstream faster,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.920]   vaping even faster, I should mention,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.320]   for a variety of reasons,
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.640]   and placing tobacco directly in contact
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.320]   with the mucosal lining is going to be the slowest.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.480]   Now, as I mentioned before,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.960]   nicotine gets into the bloodstream,
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.960]   and then because nicotine can pass
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.160]   through the so-called blood-brain barrier, the BBB,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.600]   which is basically a fence around the brain,
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.860]   because it can pass through the blood-brain barrier,
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.080]   it's going to have very rapid effects on the brain
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.140]   in these four major categories
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.360]   of neurochemicals and neural circuits.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.920]   The first of those categories,
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.600]   and this is a very important one,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.200]   this is one that was brought up in the episode
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.640]   on dopamine motivation and drive,
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.720]   and I think not just all scientists,
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.760]   but all human beings should know that within their brain,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   they have what is called the mesolimbic reward pathway.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.120]   The mesolimbic reward pathway,
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.860]   if you just want to call it the dopamine reward pathway,
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.600]   is, as the name suggests,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.480]   a set of connections between a brain area
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.000]   called the ventral tegmental area.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   You don't have to remember the names of these things,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.280]   of course, but if you want to, that's fine too.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.720]   The ventral tegmental area, or VTA,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.400]   connects to another area called the nucleus accumbens.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.960]   Now, here's what's very important.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.940]   Nicotine triggers the release of dopamine
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.200]   from the nucleus accumbens.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.280]   This is what gives nicotine its rewarding properties.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.640]   It increases motivation.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.740]   It tends to give a not so subtle,
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.400]   but very transient increase in feelings of wellbeing
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.380]   and alertness and motivation,
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.300]   and that's because of the increase in dopamine
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.100]   caused by nicotine directly within the nucleus accumbens.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.820]   Nicotine also triggers the release of certain neurochemicals
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.060]   from the ventral tegmental area itself,
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.380]   and those impinge on nucleus accumbens
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.740]   and increase dopamine levels further.
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.100]   This is what makes the rewarding properties,
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.700]   or sometimes referred to as the reinforcing properties
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.240]   of nicotine, so powerful.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.620]   This is why so many billions of people ingest nicotine
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.620]   in one form or another.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.620]   It's also why nicotine is so hard to quit,
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.380]   because there's a potent increase in dopamine
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.620]   from multiple neural circuit pathways
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.860]   within this mesolimbic reward circuitry.
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.540]   Now, within the mesolimbic reward circuitry,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.500]   there's an interesting feature.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.580]   There are accelerators that essentially
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.420]   push out more dopamine, get more dopamine released,
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.340]   and there are breaks of the so-called GABAergic variety.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.460]   GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.580]   You don't need to know too much about it
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.160]   to just understand that nicotine both increases dopamine,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.900]   but also decreases the activity of GABA,
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.260]   and so this is like pushing on the accelerator for dopamine,
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.180]   but also removing the break.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.460]   So there's a two-pronged effect of nicotine
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.820]   on reinforcement reward dopamine-related pathways,
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.500]   the feel-good motivation pathways,
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.020]   and that is an increase in dopamine and a decrease in GABA,
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.420]   and again, that's all mediated
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.860]   through this mesolimbic reward pathway
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.820]   involving the ventral tegmental area
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.220]   and the nucleus accumbens.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.660]   So if you can conceptualize even just 5%
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.820]   of what I just told you,
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.820]   or even if you can just remember nicotine increases dopamine
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.180]   and that's why it feels so good,
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.200]   it makes you want more of it,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.900]   you will have everything you need to know in mind
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.900]   in order to understand both why nicotine is so highly used
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.780]   and indeed abused, why it's so hard to quit,
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.300]   and that will point to avenues
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.620]   as to how to quit or reduce intake,
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.700]   and it also points to how nicotine can actually be used
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.200]   in an antidepressant way should you choose,
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.720]   and we will talk about what the various criteria are
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.860]   for choosing that,
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.580]   but just understand nicotine increases motivation,
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.220]   it decreases negative feelings of mood,
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.940]   it increases positive feelings of mood and motivation.
