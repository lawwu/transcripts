[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Social media has become an inferno of insults and anger, and sometimes even professing Christians
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.560]   add to the rage without thinking about the foolishness of spewing verbal abuses.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.860]   We need to do better.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.100]   And this leads to today's question from a young man, a listener to the podcast who writes
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.100]   us this.
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.920]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.760]   My father is a pastor who spends a lot of his time engaging with people on social media,
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.720]   often using demeaning and insulting language in the process.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.760]   This can range anywhere from calling people liars for saying things he disagrees with
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.020]   to straight up calling them stupid.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.560]   He seems to excuse his behavior with the mindset that it's not insulting if it's the truth,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.100]   but it still makes me very uncomfortable to see this behavior from him both as my dad
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.120]   and as my pastor.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.760]   In my view, it directly goes against scripture's call for us to not revile in return (1 Peter
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.960]   23) but to bless, and for our speech to be always gracious, seasoned with salt (Colossians
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.960]   4.6).
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.040]   I am a young Christian, and I know that my knowledge of spiritual matters is often lacking,
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.920]   but it's been burning my conscience to think that my dad might be engaging in sinful behavior
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920]   online.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.640]   I greatly would like to know your take on the matter.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.640]   Pastor John, what would you have to say?"
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.800]   Let me try to make a few comments that our young friend can consider in the formation
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.520]   of his own understanding of how to speak and how to perhaps, in the end, approach his father
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.480]   in a humble and effective way.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.480]   First, the very minimal expectation of our speech on social media should be that it is
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:53.520]   true, that it is factually true, biblically sound, and the more evident that truth, the
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.520]   better.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.280]   Then people can see why it's true.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.240]   Now, I say that's minimal, and the reason I stress that it is only minimal is that you
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.400]   can handle truth in ways that are sinful.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.600]   Speaking truth doesn't guarantee that you are speaking righteously or lovingly.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.520]   That's one of the main points of Job, chapter 3 through 31.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.440]   I mean, 29 chapters of questionable theology.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.000]   Lots of what Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar were saying to Job was in one sense true.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.800]   In fact, I'm reading through Job right now, and I just read a whole chapter.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.280]   I was just scratching my head, saying, "What's wrong with that?
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280]   What's wrong with that?
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.120]   That's what Eliphaz said."
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.520]   What was wrong with it was it was ill-timed, and it was lopsided.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.160]   But you could probably justify most of the things he said by paralleling them with the
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   Psalms.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.440]   That book, I think, is in the Bible for many reasons, and one of them is to show that truth
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.080]   is not enough.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.800]   Truth can be used unrighteously.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.000]   Here's my second observation.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.760]   Paul said in Ephesians 5:29, "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:20.040]   as is good for upbuilding, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear."
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.960]   So, besides being true, Paul says we should test what we say by whether it is aiming at
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.440]   building the other person up.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.920]   And building up, in Paul's vocabulary, means helping them grow in their faith and in their
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.960]   understanding of Christ and in their love for other people and their holiness.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:52.080]   In other words, the test is, "Am I aiming in my social media post, am I aiming to help
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:00.880]   the person that I'm talking to or talking about know God better, trust God more, love
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.480]   people better, walk in less sin and more holiness?"
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.960]   Now that leaves lots of room for criticism.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.640]   I'm not saying you can't ever say anything critical about what somebody has said or done,
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.960]   but the test of Ephesians 5:29 is, "Are we aiming manifestly at the other person's
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.320]   Godward good?"
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.080]   That he says is the gracious way to speak.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.880]   And then he adds that our speech should fit the occasion.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.400]   In other words, it takes real wisdom to know how to use truth in the most effective way
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.100]   from situation to situation.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.720]   And you can hear this in Proverbs 26, where it says in verse 7, "Like a lame man's
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.800]   legs, which hang useless, is a proverb in the mouth of fools."
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.960]   That's a true proverb.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.720]   It just hangs there like useless legs in the mouth of a fool because he doesn't know
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.180]   the situation, doesn't know how to use it.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.760]   Or verse 9, "Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.400]   the mouth of fools."
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:27.120]   In other words, a person may speak proverbial truth and his speaking may be perfectly useless
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.920]   or perfectly harmful, depending in part on whether it fits the occasion.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.760]   Now here's my third observation.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.400]   Fit the occasion has special implications for the Internet, social media.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.200]   This calls for a peculiar kind of wisdom and restraint.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:57.300]   And what's peculiar about this occasion called the Internet is that it is contextless.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:05.800]   We don't have any control over who or how or where or when a person reads what we have
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   written.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.840]   There are thousands of different settings and emotional conditions and levels of maturity
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.440]   and states of spiritual height or depth and immediate experiences and on and on.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:30.160]   In other words, we are unleashing our sentences into an unknown welter of occasions.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:37.120]   And I'm not saying that this should shut us down entirely, but I am saying wisdom,
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:44.080]   speaking, as fits the occasion, should give us a certain restraint so that we are not
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:51.920]   indifferent to all the unknown effects what we may say may have.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:58.000]   In fact, one of my biggest complaints about the way people use Twitter, for example, is
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:07.320]   that lots of what is said publicly for 10,000 people to read should be said privately to
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.060]   the person, not publicly.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.360]   So many things are said to an individual.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.960]   They are said to an individual for a grandstand of people to watch.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.700]   You say it, and I don't get that.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.700]   It really puzzles me.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:29.000]   It makes me wonder, why do you want so many people to hear you say what you just said
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.700]   to that one individual?
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.300]   So we should ask ourselves, really, why do you want so many people to hear what you say
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.300]   to your friend?
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.440]   I think there's some deep stuff going on there that's not real healthy.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.200]   I've tasted it in myself, and I see it in others.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:52.280]   Here's my fourth observation or fourth suggestion, is that we measure what we say on social media
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:59.480]   by whether it communicates a heartfelt desire, not just that a person grow in their relation
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:09.520]   toward God, but that they realize we would like to have them as more unified with us
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.360]   than we presently are.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:19.560]   In other words, when we criticize somebody for a viewpoint or an attitude, do they discern
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:27.600]   that behind that criticism we really would like the day to come when we could be friends?
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:36.000]   Or do they taste a kind of contempt that communicates, "Not only do I not like your opinion, but
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.600]   I wouldn't want to be around you even if you changed your opinion," which comes through.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   Do we want them?
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   Do we want them?
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.840]   I hear this point in Ephesians 4, 1 to 3, where Paul says, "Walk in a manner worthy
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.400]   of your calling with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:00.440]   love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:06.760]   In other words, no matter how seriously we feel we must take issue with somebody or some
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:13.120]   issue, do we give evidence that we really would like there to be peace?
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   Yes, truth grounded.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:21.800]   Truth grounded peace, but not just truth grounded, but truth grounded peace.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   Or do they pick up that what we really enjoy is combat, not reconciliation?
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:35.440]   And the fifth suggestion is that we take really seriously James 1:20, "Let every person be
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.020]   quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, for the anger of man does not produce the
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.400]   righteousness of God."
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.320]   Of course, I'm not saying there is no occasion for righteous anger.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:56.120]   I'm just saying that given the way we are sinfully made, wired by the fall, and very
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:03.080]   prone to defend ourselves, and very easily provoked and frustrated and angered, the words
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.160]   of James are really needed.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:16.120]   Be slow to anger, slow to speak, because it's very, very, very—I'll say three and stop
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:22.560]   there—very, very, very likely that your anger is not righteous and mine isn't either,
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.500]   and will not produce the good you think it might.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:34.580]   That text is a governor on our anger accelerator, and we need it.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:41.620]   And the last criterion I would mention for speaking on social media is, can people detect
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:51.440]   that your heart is deeply content in and satisfied by the beauty and worth and greatness of Jesus?
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:59.480]   That's why we exist, to display Jesus Christ as the supreme treasure of the world.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.520]   Do they taste that?
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:08.800]   Do they taste when they read or listen to what we say, I can tell they are very peacefully
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.840]   content and satisfied in Jesus?
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:18.680]   And I'll just close by saying to our young friend, if you find that these six observations
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:27.800]   I've just made might be helpful to you and your father, go to him with all humility and
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:35.000]   a deep awareness of your own sinfulness, as Galatians 6:1 says, and express to him your
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.880]   concern again, and ask him, perhaps, to read these points or listen to them or listen to
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.360]   you share them, and then don't pressure him.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:53.640]   Don't call for some big immediate change, but you and I and others will pray together
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:01.120]   that perhaps his communications might conform in the future more closely to God's Word.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.200]   Amen.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.740]   Six considerations before we publish insults online.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.740]   Those are really great.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.740]   Thank you, Pastor John, for this list.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.180]   And thank you for listening to the podcast today.

[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:25.160]   Well, we're going to break for the weekend and return on Monday with a very sensitive
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   subject.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.840]   We're going to hear from a young man with a long history of porn use, wondering what
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.160]   that history is going to do to his future marriage.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   Sobering.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.160]   That's on Monday.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.160]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.600]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime pastor and author John
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   Piper.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.640]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
