[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Recently, Pastor John delivered the Gaffin Lecture on Theology, Culture, and Mission
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.480]   at Westminster Theological Seminary near Philadelphia. But the night before was a gathering at the
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.220]   seminary where Pastor John also spoke. The short message to the small gathering was not
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.120]   officially recorded, but a few guys in the room did record from their iPhones, and Jared
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.380]   Olyphant was one of them. Here is one clip from the message I want to share, and although
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.680]   the audio quality is not great, the excerpt is interesting because here Pastor John recounts
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.280]   his seminary days at Fuller, 1968-1971, and coming face to face with Reformed Theology.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.480]   Here's what he said to the small gathering.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.480]   I didn't learn my Reformed Theology mainly from John Calvin or even Jonathan Edwards,
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.960]   whom I esteem as highly as one can possibly esteem a non-divine being. I learned it from
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.440]   Romans 9 and Romans 1-8 and Galatians and the Sermon on the Mount and 1 Corinthians
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.900]   with Dan Fuller pushing my nose down in the nitty-gritty of the conjunctions and the connectors
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:18.120]   of "in order that" and "because" and "so that" and "although" and so on. And to this day,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.960]   I find the theology inescapable in the Bible. Well, as I looked around as I was discovering
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.760]   these things and said, "What am I getting into? Where is this? What is this?" There
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.160]   was this bastion called Westminster on the other side of the country that had solidity
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.560]   about it. It wasn't like somebody woke up and said, "I don't think we'll believe in
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.920]   the sovereignty of God now." I mean, those of you who do historical theology will regard
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.520]   this as utterly naive because you know it goes back further than Westminster. But for
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.480]   me, casting about as a Southern Baptist kid, suddenly discovering that his mind was being
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:16.840]   dismantled, to have anything that looked solid on this felt very reassuring. The people at
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.040]   Westminster over the years, one of the reasons this institution has the staying power that
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.640]   it does is because of how long some of you and some of them taught. So there's Van Til,
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.760]   33 years, and John Murray, 37 years, and Ned Stonehouse, 33 years, and Paul Woolley, 48
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.320]   years, and Ed Clowney, 40 years, and Dr. Gaffin here, associated now at least for almost 50
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.000]   years with the seminary. And I looked at this institution and I thought, "This is not a
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.840]   fly-by-night thing. These people have been thinking about this for a long time and have
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.200]   been teaching it for a long time." And then of course you discover, well yeah, and there's
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:17.920]   dead people who've been thinking about it for 5,000 years. So in my early days, Romans
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.560]   was the key watershed document to turn my world upside down. And you know who it was
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.800]   who guided me through Romans? John Murray. That is the most beautifully written commentary
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.760]   on the planet. People who write commentaries are not generally good writers. They just
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.800]   patch things together. I read a sentence and I just want to go back and memorize it because
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.840]   his eloquence is phenomenal. The work that must have gone in to the way he says what
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:03.480]   he says about the glories of Romans 5 and Romans 8 are amazing. So I thank God for John
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   Murray. So I thank you for staying power and solidity and symbolic existence. Just always
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:25.120]   there. Westminster, the very name signifies the standard that is raised.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.280]   That was Pastor John at a small gathering at Westminster Theological Seminary on the
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.240]   evening of March 11th, 2014. The next day he delivered the Gaffin Lecture on Theology,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.520]   Culture, and Mission, which you can watch or listen to at DesiringGod.org. Search for
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.080]   it by the title, "The New Calvinism and the New Community." It was that message where
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.160]   he opened up with his 12 features of the New Calvinism, which made the rounds on the blogosphere.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.520]   So how should this New Calvinism relate to the broader evangelical church? The question
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.200]   was posed to Pastor John recently and we'll hear his response tomorrow. I'm your host
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.120]   Tony Reinke. See you then.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.120]   [END]
