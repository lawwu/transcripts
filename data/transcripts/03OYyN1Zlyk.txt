[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   For the last several months, we have been working our way through the book of Ephesians
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.720]   because it's so foundational, so practical, and covers so much of the range of Christian
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.120]   life.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.440]   We have found ourselves now in the fifth chapter of Ephesians in a section that deals with
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.440]   marriage.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.740]   We're going to be looking at that this morning with particular attention to the husband.
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.700]   So this is your day, men, to hear from heaven about your responsibility as a husband.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.100]   But before we get there, I want you to turn to Genesis, chapter 2, Genesis, chapter 2,
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.680]   and I'd like to lay a bit of a foundation so that we can understand what we're up against
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.420]   in the current world that we live in.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.820]   The fallen world with regard to marriage.
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:11.340]   In Genesis, chapter 2 and verse 18, we have the inspired record of the creation of woman.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.860]   And I just want you to follow along as I read, starting in Genesis 2 and verse 18: "Then
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.400]   the Lord God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.780]   Make him a helper suitable for him.'
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.220]   Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky,
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.220]   and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.000]   And whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.740]   The man gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to every beast of
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.740]   the field.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.380]   But for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him."
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.660]   So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept.
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.860]   Then he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.300]   The Lord God fashioned into a woman the rib which he had taken from the man and brought
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.840]   her to the man.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.380]   The man said, 'This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.360]   She shall be called woman.'
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360]   And he said, 'What is this woman?'
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.000]   She said, 'She is a woman, because she was taken out of man.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.220]   For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife,
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.440]   and they shall become one flesh.'
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.500]   And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed."
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.380]   So in Genesis, chapter 2, God basically creates a man, and then from that man creates
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.340]   a woman.
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.160]   And then in Genesis, chapter 2, God inaugurates what Peter calls the grace of life, which
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.640]   is marriage.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.440]   And marriage in Scripture has a number of purposes.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.340]   One companionship, and that's what you see here.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.240]   Man needed a helper suitable for him.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.060]   Marriage also has the purpose of procreation.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.320]   Back in chapter 1, it says, "In a broad sense, God created man in His own image and said,
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.760]   'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.'"
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.240]   So God's design for marriage is companionship and children.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.660]   In 1 Corinthians, chapter 7, we find that God's design for marriage is also moral purity.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.400]   We are instructed there about the fact that you must marry rather than to burn.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.340]   That is to say, rather than having unfulfilled natural sexual desires, you need to marry.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.300]   So it's a matter of marriage.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.980]   God's design for moral purity.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.020]   But I think in the broad sense, marriage is, with all of that being true, also it is a
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:12.420]   place which is most defined by extensive experiences of love: love for one another, love for children,
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.860]   love for grandchildren, love for great-grandchildren, love for extended family.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.780]   It is really the core of human love.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.280]   And a marriage should then be the best.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.280]   It should be the gift that keeps on giving.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.200]   It gives love to the two that marry, and then it adds to that love with children, and then
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.520]   it adds with spouses, and then it adds with grandchildren, and then it just keeps on adding
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.360]   more and more fulfilling relationships of love.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.320]   That was God's design.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.560]   And in the beginning, it was a beautiful relationship.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.260]   In verse 25 of chapter 2, it says, "I will give you a child, and I will give you a wife,
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.260]   and I will give you a son."
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.780]   And it sums it up by saying, "The man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:07.360]   There was no such thing as a perverted thought or an evil thought of any kind in their mind."
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.520]   No shame.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.320]   But then we come to chapter 3, and in chapter 3, we are introduced to Satan, the serpent,
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:24.240]   who comes and tempts Eve to distrust God, to actually believe that God was flawed.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.940]   That God didn't want her to eat of the fruit because she would have the knowledge of good
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.460]   and evil, and she would be like God, and God didn't want anyone intruding into His territory.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.820]   And so in a very flawed way, He had restricted her from something that was good.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.140]   She bought the devil's lie, and in Genesis 3:6, she saw that the tree was good for food
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.220]   - that's the lust of the eyes - and that it was - that's the lust of the flesh, I mean.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.960]   And that it was delight to the eyes - that's the lust of the eyes - and that the tree was
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.100]   desirable to make one wise, and that's the pride of life - the three basic categories
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.680]   which define our temptation.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.280]   So based upon the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, she took
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.920]   from its fruit and ate, gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.200]   Then the eyes of both of them were opened; they knew they were naked; all of a sudden,
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.280]   shame appeared.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.020]   We don't know the exact thoughts that were in their mind, but they were corrupted, they
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.360]   were perverted.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.960]   Even in that marriage, they felt embarrassed by their shame and guilt, and sewed fig leaves
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.580]   together and made themselves loin coverings.
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:51.420]   They realized, as the only two people in the world, that their thoughts could be corrupted
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.180]   if they were exposed to nakedness.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.040]   Clothing came into existence at this point.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.160]   God actually clothed them by the sacrifice of a lamb, demonstrating that the only covering
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.580]   for sin would be such a sacrifice, namely, and ultimately, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:19.940]   From that point on, clothing became the barrier, the normal human barrier to lust and shame.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.160]   Any society that begins to sink into the morass of the law of lust, the moral law of lust,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.680]   and the depths of sin will begin to expose itself in nakedness, and ultimately, as we
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:39.940]   have seen, proliferate pornography and nakedness everywhere, as it finds its contentment and
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:45.620]   its satisfaction in what is offensive to God.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.820]   So now there's shame, and beyond the shame, there's a curse.
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.140]   God says to the man in verse 9, "Where are you?"
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.660]   "Where are you?"
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.940]   And then He confronts them both.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:05.420]   First the woman, He says, "You are cursed," verse 16.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.660]   You will experience pain in childbirth.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.320]   In pain you will bring forth children.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.840]   And yet your desire will be for your husband.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.620]   This isn't a desire for him that's healthy; this is an impulse to overpower him, to rule
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.120]   over him.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.340]   To usurp his leadership.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.840]   And he will dominate you, and so you have the conflict of marriage.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.420]   In the fall, the woman seeks to overpower the man.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:41.160]   She seeks to operate independently as if she were the leader, which she did in her succumbing
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.880]   to temptation without the protection of her husband.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.920]   And the husband will then dominate her.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:54.100]   And so you have the abuse of that relationship going both ways.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:09:00.820]   And we read in verses 17 to 19 that the ground is cursed, and man is going to toil all the
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:07.400]   days of his life to subdue the ground to be able to produce survival.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.740]   So there's not just going to be the bliss of the garden and two innocent people enjoying
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.880]   everything about a perfect marriage.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.320]   There are going to be all kinds of complications.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.080]   In addition to that, Satan is going to come after the man-in-law.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.700]   "I will put enmity between you and the woman," verse 15.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:31.700]   "I will put enmity between you and the woman, between your seed and her seed."
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:37.200]   Satan is going to come against marriage, against the woman, and eventually Satan is going to
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.360]   come against the ultimate seed of the woman, who is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:49.200]   So marriage has really fallen on disastrous, disastrous ground.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.060]   From innocence to without shame, there has been a reversal of roles.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:10:01.140]   She acts independently of her husband, and he succumbs to her temptation to join her
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.020]   in the sin.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:10.380]   By the time you get to chapter 4, the impulses of the fallen human beings are working and
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.920]   been passed on to the next generation of Cain and Abel, so that you have fratricide, the
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.460]   murder of the brother.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:24.040]   Cain kills Abel, and then not long after this, you run into polygamy in the early
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:31.940]   chapters of Genesis, and then perverted sex, and then adultery, and then homosexuality,
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.860]   and then fornication, and then rape, and then prostitution, and then incest, and then
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.600]   seduction, and you're not even out of the book of Genesis.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:54.020]   All of this comes because of the Fall: two cursed sinners creating more cursed sinners
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.000]   than ever.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:04.160]   Creating a cursed society under the control of Satan and exposed to all manner of temptations
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:10.900]   and corruptions, struggles to find the meaning of marriage.
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.860]   Sin attacks marriage.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.440]   Selfishness attacks marriage.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.740]   Satan attacks marriage.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.100]   Society attacks marriage.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:24.000]   And early on in Genesis, the attack is so successful, so disastrous.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.400]   That by the time you get to chapter 6, God drowns the entire world, drowns the entire
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:38.060]   world because the thoughts and intents of their hearts were only evil continually.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:44.360]   So the bliss of that first marriage was lost in the Fall, and it didn't take very long
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:52.060]   before God literally drowned the entire world, with the exception of Noah's wife and their
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.980]   sons and wives.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.980]   And the people survived.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:01.740]   But when Noah came out of the ark, we found out very fast that he was a sinner, and that
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:08.380]   sin had not survived - sin had not been extinguished, rather, but sin had survived the flood because
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.020]   there were eight people who were sinners who came out of the ark.
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:17.360]   And so immediately there were more of these same kinds of perversions.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.580]   In fact, some of the ones in the list I gave you came after the flood.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.960]   Most of them actually did.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:30.060]   So marriage has grave difficulty in this kind of setting.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:36.840]   Let me say it again: sin attacks marriage, selfishness attacks marriage, Satan attacks
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.860]   marriage, and society attacks marriage.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:47.200]   Marriage has a hard road, even though it is the grace of life.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:53.940]   Its destruction is constant, and it's exponential.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.020]   Not too many years ago, even in our society, we could look back and say people honored
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.020]   marriage.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.360]   Not anymore.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:08.420]   Marriage is largely irrelevant to this young generation coming up.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.020]   We have seen the destruction of marriage by all kinds of things.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.520]   I don't need to go through the litany of those.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.980]   The all-out assault on marriage is just satanic and sinful.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.920]   We are living in the era of almost a pre-war.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:31.660]   Pre-flood kind of society where we wouldn't be surprised to see God judge again, this
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.780]   time by fire.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:43.260]   So marriage, God's wonderful creation, the grace of life, can it be saved?
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.580]   Let's go back to Ephesians 5.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:53.900]   Let's go back to the beginning in the sense of what God intended.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.360]   Restored in Christ.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   Restored in Christ.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:06.740]   Let me read chapter 5 of Ephesians, starting at verse 22 and down through verse 33.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:14.160]   This is the divine design and order for a marriage that can be, in spite of fallenness,
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.780]   the grace of life.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.400]   "Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.880]   For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church."
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.060]   "He himself being the Savior of the body."
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:33.800]   "But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.880]   in everything."
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.920]   "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.520]   for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:52.700]   the Word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.860]   or wrinkle or any such thing."
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.700]   "But that she would be holy and blameless."
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:04.440]   "So, husbands, ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:10.000]   He who loves his own wife loves himself, for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.740]   and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church, because we are members of His
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.740]   body."
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.540]   "For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife,
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.840]   and the two shall become one."
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:31.340]   "This mystery is great, but I'm speaking with reverence to Christ and the church.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:37.340]   Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:44.780]   the wife must see to it that she respects her husband."
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:52.480]   Now backing up to verse 18, just to remind you, those who are Spirit-filled - verse 18,
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.820]   filled with the Spirit.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.520]   Those who are joyful worshipers - verse 19.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.540]   Those who are constantly thankful - verse 20.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:09.540]   And those who are mutually submissive are the ones who are going to enjoy the richness
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:14.160]   of marriage as the grace of life.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.620]   Last week we talked about the wives.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:22.200]   This week I want to pick it up at verse 25 and the duty of the husband, and it's so simple
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.800]   and impossible.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:32.380]   It's impossible to misunderstand one command: "Husbands, love your wives."
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:39.440]   Nothing about authority there, nothing about dominance, nothing about ruling, nothing about
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.480]   subjecting, nothing about commanding.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.940]   "Husbands, love your wives."
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.780]   That defines the kind of headship in a marriage that God desires.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:17:01.100]   Obviously, it's never abusive, it's never overbearing, it's never inconsiderate, it's
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:08.460]   never thoughtless, it's never harsh, it's never unkind, because it is defined as love.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.240]   And this is the highest and noblest of loves.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.720]   The verb is agapao , that love which is the love of the will, which transcends
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.760]   all other loves, which by its own nature is selfless and sacrificial.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   "So, husbands, it's pretty simple.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.020]   The responsibility is to love your wives."
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.720]   That's the command.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.540]   And this is to be generated by the husband.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.500]   Understand, the command is to the husband to love.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.880]   It says nothing about the wife, whether she's lovable or not, or whether she's occasionally
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.520]   lovable, or rarely lovable, or never lovable.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.740]   Doesn't change the command, because the command is to love your wives.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.960]   And that is the reality.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:04.720]   And the kind of love, again, is the highest and noblest and purest and best love.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:11.800]   Now let's define that, and we'll allow the Spirit of God to do that for us in a way that
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.540]   is just really overpowering.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.120]   What do you mean, "Love your wives"?
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:23.720]   Oh, this is what I mean, verse 25: "Just as Christ also loved the church."
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.640]   Wow, that sets the standard pretty high.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.220]   Love your wives as Christ loved the church?
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.480]   What kind of love was that?
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:43.100]   Well, He proved His love for us while we were enemies.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.400]   He loved us when we were unlovable.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.820]   He loved us when we were rebellious.
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.120]   He loved us when we were full of hatred.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.700]   He loved us when we were wretched.
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.860]   He loved us when we were vile, sinful.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.140]   That's the kind of love.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.600]   This is not love that is won by the object.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:09.720]   This is love that is given in spite of the failures of the object.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:17.680]   Chrysostom, the golden-mouthed preacher in the fourth-century church, wrote this: "Hear
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.900]   the measure of this love.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.620]   If it be needful that you should give your life to the Lord, you will be given to the
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.620]   Lord.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.360]   If it be needful that you should give your life for her, or be cut to pieces a thousand
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:34.420]   times, or endure anything whatever, refuse it not.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:43.900]   Christ bought His church and brought His church to His feet by His great love, not by threats,
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.860]   nor any such thing.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:52.760]   So do you conduct yourself toward your wife."
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.600]   He understood exactly that.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.140]   He understood exactly what this is saying.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.140]   Love your wife?
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.140]   How?
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.140]   How do I love my wife?
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.140]   What do you mean by that?
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.600]   I mean, love your wife as Christ also loved the church.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:11.980]   That's the model, and that's the pattern, and no less than that.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:19.620]   Now this is just stunning in the context of the people of Ephesus and the Roman world,
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.580]   because Roman law basically treated women as if they were women.
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.380]   They were slaves.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.460]   They were less than human.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:35.860]   In fact, Cato, writing Roman law, says this: "If you were to catch your wife in an act
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:41.180]   of infidelity, you may kill her without a trial.
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:47.000]   But if she were to catch you, she would not venture to touch you with her finger.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.880]   She has no such right."
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.560]   Well, that's the role of women in ancient Rome.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:21:04.520]   So what God is saying through the apostle Paul is shocking: "Love your wives, and love
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:11.980]   them as Christ also loved the church."
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.340]   This sets the standard so high.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:23.120]   There are several considerations with regard to defining this love over in 1 Peter 3, if
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:23.540]   you look at it from the perspective of the Bible.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.520]   I'm going to read it for just a moment, 1 Peter 3:7.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.220]   You get a little more insight into it, and we looked at this briefly last week.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:39.600]   "You husbands, in the same way" - and these are some of the ways that love expresses itself
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:47.740]   - "live with your wives first in an understanding way."
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:53.520]   This love demands understanding, knowledge, some translations say.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:00.180]   "Knowing her sensitivity, knowing her feelings, knowing her needs."
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:08.520]   This is not some macho, independent, insensitive kind of dominance that we're talking about,
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:17.120]   but rather it is living in a way that displays the fact that you are in touch with the depth
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.500]   of her understanding, her feelings, her thoughts, her desires.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:32.680]   Secondly, it calls not only for such consideration, but even for chivalry as with someone weaker
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.860]   since she is a woman.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:42.420]   Not weaker intellectually, not weaker in terms of wisdom, not weaker in any spiritual sense,
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.300]   but by God's design, man is stronger.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.300]   He is the protector.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.940]   He is the provider.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.500]   He is the source of security and strength in the union.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.480]   She should know that.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.940]   She should feel protected.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.840]   She should feel secure.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.280]   You are her knight in shining armor.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:09.100]   And then thirdly, not only consideration and a measure of chivalry, but you should show
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.620]   her honor.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:19.200]   So this love encompasses showing honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.460]   In other words, you're treating her like a believer, you're treating her like an
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.460]   angel, you're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.460]   You're treating her like a man.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.460]   You're treating her like a man.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.460]   You're treating her like a woman.

[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.460]   You're treating her like a woman.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.460]   You're treating her like a woman.

[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:52.000]   You don't want anything to mar the beauty of your wife, and the beauty of your wife
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.440]   is defiled.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:35:00.380]   You find at the end of verse 27 as holy and blameless.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.860]   You are an instrument of her sanctification.
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:10.400]   That's why I said last week marriage is just really the husband doing anything and everything
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.800]   that brings joy and spiritual benefit to his wife.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.040]   It's a simple idea.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.260]   You are to be used by God to cleanse her.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:21.980]   And particularly by the washing of the hands.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.120]   You are to be used by the washing of water with the Word.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.420]   That's the cleansing agent.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:30.520]   John 15:3 says, "It's the Word that cleanses us."
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:36.960]   Titus 3:5, "The washing of regeneration by the Word."
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:43.480]   Christ purifies His church by washing His church with the Word, and that is the role
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:51.520]   of the husband, to be the cleansing instrument, using the Word of God.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:36:00.080]   We're not going to have to wash His wife so that her true beauty can be seen.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.620]   Jesus prayed, "Sanctify them by Thy truth.
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.940]   Thy Word is truth."
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.720]   The Word is the sanctifying agent.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.120]   The Word cleanses.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:17.520]   Christ loves His church enough to sacrifice Himself for it, and to then go on cleansing
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.060]   His church so that she would be without sin.
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:26.360]   Without spot or wrinkle, and holy and blameless.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:33.980]   What a beautiful picture of how a husband is the sanctifying instrument of the Spirit
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.320]   of God for his wife.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:46.120]   So sacrifice and purity mark Christlike love.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.640]   And there can't be any less standard than this.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.600]   Christ is the sacrifice.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.420]   He is the standard.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.160]   And His love for the church.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.560]   There's a third thing to say about this.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:06.320]   We are to love our wives not only in a sacrificing and purifying way, but in a caring way.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.880]   And that's what we see in verses 28 to 30.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:14.360]   So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.040]   In other words, you are one flesh.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.140]   You're to love your wife as your own body.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.240]   He who loves his own wife loves himself.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:29.380]   In other words, if you want the best for yourself, then love your wife, because you really are
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.100]   inseparable from her.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:39.820]   And her contentment and her reciprocating love will be your greatest joy.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:46.060]   No one ever hated his own flesh, verse 29 says, but nourishes and cherishes it, just
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.700]   as Christ also does the church.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.680]   And here we're back to Christ again.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:59.600]   The same way that Christ cherishes and nourishes His church, in the same way that He desires
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.440]   the best, that He offers continual care.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:09.540]   You know, I think about the fact that He has given us all things that pertain to life and
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.540]   godliness.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:17.320]   I think about earlier in the book of Ephesians, how much does Christ love us?
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.220]   He loves us enough.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:26.880]   If you look at chapter 1, that He chose us before the foundation of the world, that He
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:34.100]   adopted us, that He redeemed us, verse 7, that He forgave us.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:41.620]   And all of this He lavished, He lavished on us.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:44.580]   This is lavish care.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:48.760]   We have been blessed, verse 3.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:55.360]   "With every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ."
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.240]   That's what this is talking about.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.140]   Bless your wife.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.720]   Sacrifice for her.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:18.300]   Be a purifying instrument of God in her life, and lavish her with all possible blessings.
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.060]   And the marriage is difficult.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.120]   We get it.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.000]   We all have the same challenges.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.540]   Society strikes against us.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.740]   Satan's coming against us.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.340]   Our own flesh makes it hard.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.280]   But here are the patterns.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:38.800]   And the assumption is if you are commanded to do with your wife what Christ does in loving
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.740]   His church, that you have the power to do that.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:47.820]   And, of course, Romans 5 says, "God has shed His love abroad in your heart through His holy
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.780]   Spirit."
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:54.320]   What does it mean then to care for her?
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:01.520]   It means to make sure that she has everything that meets her needs.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:08.460]   Not necessarily wants, not outrageous and outlandish desires, but that she is fully
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:15.220]   provided for, protected, preserved, cared for with all those things that rightly should
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.340]   be expected.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:27.140]   What you would do for yourself, you would do no less for her because you are one flesh.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.800]   Nourish is the idea of feeding.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.840]   Cherish is the idea of warming with body heat.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:38.220]   So you provide everything that she needs, and you provide the security and the warmth
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.380]   of ongoing love and affection.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.860]   And you do this because Christ is your example.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:53.480]   Now, there's one more characteristic of this love.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.700]   It is a purifying love.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.780]   It is a sacrificial love.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.900]   It is a caring love.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.580]   And go down to verse 31.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.480]   It is also an unbreakable love.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.800]   And here is a quote from back in Genesis 2.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:15.200]   We read it earlier: "For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.740]   be joined to his wife.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.300]   And the two shall become one flesh."
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:25.960]   This is an unbreakable love, an indivisible love.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.820]   You become one flesh.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.060]   One is the indivisible number, right?
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.920]   That's why God hates divorce.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.240]   What God has joined together, don't let man separate.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.180]   This is to be the kind of love that Christ has for His church.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:46.260]   And Romans 8 says, "Nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus,
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:46.780]   right?"
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.020]   Romans 8.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.620]   It's that same kind of love.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:58.400]   It's the kind of love that leaves behind - strong word - means to abandon parents, and then
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.180]   cleaves, proskalao.
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:11.380]   It literally means to be glued to, to be stuck to, not stuck with, but stuck to.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:16.140]   It's designed by God.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.140]   It's designed by God.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.140]   It's designed by God.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.140]   And so, in the end, what God has for us is to be an unbreakable love.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.140]   And so, in the end, what God has for us is to be an unbreakable love.
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.140]   So this is how husbands love their wives.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:26.960]   Now, if you're looking at the idea that a husband has authority, this - what you may
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.640]   have thought in the past about what that means, and you may have chafed against that
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:37.000]   kind of authority, whatever authority and responsibility for leadership a husband has
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.740]   is to be defined as sacrificial, purifying, caring, and unbreakable; and unbreakable means
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.020]   fidelity and unbreakability.
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:50.480]   And faithfulness, fidelity and faithfulness.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:43:00.360]   I said recently to a couple that, speaking to the man, I said, "Your integrity and your
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:06.280]   fidelity is her security."
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:15.900]   So the husband is to be the one who makes sure the bond is never broken.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:22.140]   So this is how marriage can be what God wants it to be.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.220]   Obviously there's still going to be issues.
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:28.100]   That's why the New Testament is full of all kinds of other commands, right?
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:33.480]   If you're deviating from living a godly life, if you're deviating from walking in the Holy
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:38.400]   Spirit, if you're deviating from having the fruit of the Spirit - love, joy, peace, gentleness,
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:44.200]   goodness, faith, meekness, self-control - if you're functioning in fleshly ways, it makes
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.780]   this impossible.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:51.160]   But the Word of God is saying it's not only possible, it's commanded, and you have in
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:57.380]   having the Spirit of God all the resources you need to see it fulfilled.
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:04.060]   Now, there's one final point here that just sums up what we've already said, and it's
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.620]   in verse 32.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:15.660]   I described the manner of love like Christ had for His church, but here is the motive.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:22.260]   Obviously, there's a motive for your own self-fulfillment, for your own well-being,
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.660]   for your own joy, for your own happiness, and by the way, for the happiness of your
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.600]   children.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:33.500]   Your children are only going to be as happy as you are content in your marriage.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.360]   You set the tone.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:43.620]   If you love the way Christ loved the church, men and women, if you submit the way the church
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.540]   submits to Christ, your children will be content.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:51.540]   Your children will be in the most healthy environment to most readily embrace the truth
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.480]   of the gospel.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:03.140]   But there's another thing beside just having a happy home that comes with this, and it's
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.140]   in verse 32.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.660]   This mystery is great.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:13.220]   This is a secret now to be revealed, not revealed before in Scripture.
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.420]   What is the mystery?
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:19.000]   The mystery is I'm speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:29.080]   The mystery is this: that Christ and His relation to the church is the symbol that is demonstrated
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:31.080]   in marriage.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:35.560]   So you have responsibility not only for your own joy and happiness and that of your children
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:40.300]   and everybody else who intersects with your life, but you are given a responsibility to
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:45.300]   show the world the relationship between Christ and His church as demonstrated.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.760]   Demonstrated in your marriage.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.120]   Think about that.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:55.660]   Think about that responsibility, that that is the motive.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:04.080]   And if you come short of that, you have failed in what is a great, great opportunity.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:12.140]   It's a great sacred secret now revealed that Christian marriages can demonstrate to the
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.180]   world the relationship between Christ and His church.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.180]   It's a great sacred secret now revealed that Christian marriages can demonstrate to the

[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.180]   It's a great sacred secret now revealed that Christian marriages can demonstrate to the world the relationship
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.180]   between Christ and His church.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.180]   It's a great sacred secret now revealed that Christian marriages can demonstrate to the world the relationship
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.180]   between Christ and His church.

[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.180]   It's a great sacred secret now revealed that Christian marriages can demonstrate to the

[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.180]   It's a great sacred secret now revealed that Christian marriages can demonstrate to the

[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.180]   It's a great sacred secret now revealed that Christian marriages can demonstrate to the
