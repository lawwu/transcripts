[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Today's question comes to us from a listener named Scott.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.640]   "Pastor John, based on recent medical diagnoses and due to my life circumstances, the likelihood
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.960]   that I will reach middle age are very slim.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.080]   I'm in my late 20s.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.020]   My brother died at age 18.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.520]   This prospect has caused me to go through battles of trusting God and fighting off depression.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.920]   I understand God is sovereign and I have no right to ask why He's made me this way.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.560]   I look forward to being made perfect, but until then, how can I live out the rest of
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.680]   my life in a courageous manner that is honoring to Him?
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.360]   How do I prevent the prospect of a premature death from turning me jaded toward our sovereign
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.400]   Lord?"
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.240]   My response to Scott's question is a kind of quiet reverence.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.480]   Whenever I am in the presence of someone - and as a pastor I've been in the presence of
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:10.400]   many - who has been told that their life may be cut short, I feel as though I'm on sacred
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400]   ground.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400]   Yes.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.240]   As if eternity had penetrated that moment and that place.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.520]   So Scott, please know that I want to respond to your questions with a great sense of the
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.680]   weightiness of the reality that you lost a brother at 18, and that your own life could
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.940]   well be cut short, not even to reach midlife.
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.760]   So I don't take it lightly.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.600]   However, one of the first things I want to do is gently push back on your statement that
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.040]   you have no right to ask God why He made you this way.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.420]   I realize that's a direct quote from Romans 9:20.
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.560]   You are a Bible guy.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.560]   I can tell that you've read this text.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.560]   Here's what it says.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.040]   "Who are you, O man, to answer back to God?
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:19.240]   So what is molded, say to the molder, 'Why have you made me like this?'"
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.200]   That's a quote from our friend.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.440]   "Has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.280]   use and another for dishonorable?"
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:39.920]   So Scott is inferring, "Well, I better keep my mouth shut, because Paul scolds people
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.440]   who ask, 'Why have you made me thus?'"
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:53.480]   However, I think what Paul is rejecting here is not a humble request for understanding
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.800]   accompanied by a willingness to accept God's answer, but rather a question that is really
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.440]   an objection—"Why have you made me this way?"—along with a proud unwillingness
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.080]   to accept God's answer.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:21.480]   So my guess is that in these coming years, for Scott, God is going to give you some very
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.840]   precious answers to the question, "Why?"
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   It's not wrong.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:36.040]   It is not wrong to humbly ask God for those answers and accompany that request with a
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.120]   willingness to say yes to His answer.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.600]   Now, you express two beautiful longings in your question.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.360]   Number one, you want to live the rest of your life in a way that honors the Lord, you said.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   Number two, you don't want to become jaded toward the Lord in His sovereignty in your
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.600]   life.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.320]   It is a wonderful thing that God's Word speaks directly to both of those longings that you
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.760]   expressed—the issues of honoring the Lord in the face of death and the issue of not
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.800]   being jaded in the face of death.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.880]   And the first way God speaks to the honoring piece is in Philippians 1:20.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:32.680]   I'm sure you know this, but let's all just wonderfully be reminded of how Christ speaks
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.400]   concerning the honoring of Christ in Paul's mouth here.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.880]   "It is my eager expectation and hope that I will not at all be ashamed, but with full
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.360]   courage now as always, Christ will be honored."
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   That's your longing.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.840]   That was Paul's exact longing in exactly your situation.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.960]   "Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death."
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   Now, how?
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.560]   How does he pursue that?
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.440]   "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.960]   If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.480]   Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.800]   I am hard-pressed between the two.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.600]   My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better."
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:28.040]   So Paul says that Christ will be honored in his approaching death if he can see and savor
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.600]   Christ as more precious than life.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.320]   It's no accident that some of the greatest Christians, as they approach the end of their
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:46.920]   lives, shift all their focus onto seeing and savoring the glories of Christ in his Scriptures.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.280]   In fact, John Owen, when he knew he was dying, he'd spent the last days writing on the glories
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.880]   of Christ.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.040]   Secondly, with regard to your longing that you not become jaded at the sovereignty of
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:10.520]   God, it is remarkable that the very opposite of becoming jaded toward the Lord is blessing
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.520]   the Lord, right?
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.480]   I mean, I think those are the opposite.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:20.600]   I'm becoming jaded and bitter toward the Lord, or I'm blessing the name of the Lord.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   And that's exactly how Job responded in the face of the death of all ten of his children.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.360]   Their lives were cut short right in his face, and I know that almost everybody listening
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.200]   to this would say, "I would rather die than all my ten children die."
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.960]   Of course we would.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:50.720]   Then Job arose and tore his robe—he tore his robe, this wasn't small—shaved his head,
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.000]   fell on the ground, and worshipped and said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, naked
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.880]   shall I return.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.000]   The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.560]   Blessed," not jaded, "Blessed be the name of the Lord," Job 1, 20 and 21.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.600]   Now just pause and let that sink in, all of us.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:23.520]   "Blessed, blessed be the name of the Lord," not cursed be the name of the Lord, not jaded
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.600]   be the name of the Lord, "Blessed, praised, spoken well of, reverenced."
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:37.000]   So how do we experience the Lord as blessed, the name of the Lord as blessed, blessed,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   well spoken of, reverenced, praised, rather than being jaded in the face of decline and
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.200]   death, even if it's cut short?
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.880]   Paul put it like this in 2 Corinthians 4, 16, "So we do not lose heart."
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.720]   There's another statement about the opposite of being jaded.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.480]   We do not lose heart.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.800]   And he's just speaking right into Scott's situation.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.600]   Paul knows that you can lose heart.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   People can lose heart.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.880]   "I've just had enough of this.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.880]   I've lost it.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.240]   I can't get my heart back anymore.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.160]   I'm a hard, jaded person."
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.440]   Paul says, "No, no, no.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.760]   Let's not go there.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.440]   We do not lose heart.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.720]   So our outer self is wasting away.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.200]   Our inner self is being renewed day by day.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:32.000]   For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.480]   comparison as we look not to the things that are seen, but to the things that are unseen.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.680]   For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal."
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:54.680]   So perhaps, Scott, a story may help as I end this, help focus your and our minds in a helpful
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.680]   way.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   Marshall Shelley.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.440]   I know Marshall Shelley personally from way back.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.880]   I haven't talked to him for a long time.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.120]   He teaches at Denver Seminary.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.040]   He's, I think, about my age, a little older, maybe one or two years older.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:14.840]   He lost a child in 1991, and he wrote about it in an article published in Christianity
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.160]   Today way back then called "Two Minutes to Eternity."
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.760]   Here's what he said.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:29.240]   He, his son, he named him Toby, he entered the world of light at 8.20 p.m., November
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:36.520]   22, 1991, and he departed, the doctor said, at 8.22.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.080]   Why did God create a child?
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.000]   This is still Marshall talking.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.240]   Why did God create a child to live two minutes?
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.920]   And he says, "He didn't.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:53.380]   He didn't create Toby to live two minutes or Mandy to live two years.
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:59.360]   He didn't create me to live 40 years or whatever number he may choose.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.880]   God created Toby for eternity.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:12.560]   He created each of us for eternity, where we may be surprised to find our true calling,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.760]   which always seemed just out of reach here on earth."
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.800]   That's the end of the quote from Marshall.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.080]   In fact, listen to the way Paul describes that life to come.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.320]   First Timothy 6.19, "Store up for yourselves a good foundation for the future so that you
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.720]   may take hold of that which is truly life."
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:41.080]   In other words, the life to come is not a postscript to this true life.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.440]   Rather, this life is prelude to real life.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.680]   That's what he's saying in that phrase, "truly life."
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:56.840]   Paul describes in the coming ages, when God shows the immeasurable riches of his grace
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.880]   and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus, that's when we will find true life.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:09.140]   Ephesians 2.7, "It will take age upon age upon age upon age of ages for God to show
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:14.280]   all his kindness to us because it is immeasurable," Paul says.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.880]   This is the mindset of Christians.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.240]   That's what we've got to have, me, Scott, all of us.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:28.200]   I've been so helped by stories like that and by the apostle Paul.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:35.440]   I pray, Scott, you will feel this amazing immeasurableness of the kindness that is about
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.680]   to be poured out on you forever.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.000]   That's an incredible story and a very good word for all of us, Pastor John.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.660]   We're so short-sighted in this life.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.200]   Thank you for your words.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.400]   Thank you for listening to this podcast as well.
