[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   All right, Traumath, apparently the Rain Man, David Sacks, is now the architect.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.240]   I think he's been working behind the scenes, according to a bunch of the news stories.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.520]   I like Puppet Master.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.880]   The Puppet Master? Okay, well, let's cut.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.800]   Geppetto. We should call Sacks Geppetto.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.600]   Let's cut. We're going live now to the RNC in Milwaukee and live coverage.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.400]   Sith Lord, David Sacks, are you there?
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.640]   Oh, there he is. It's Palpatine. Tell us about your new empire.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.280]   The center of Palpatine.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.000]   Everything has proceeded as I have foreseen.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:53.040]   Obviously, Sacks, Trump makes his own decisions.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.200]   You're getting a little bit too much credit, I think.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.800]   Yeah, absolutely. No, I mean, I'm mocking, I'm satirizing the New York Times and Business
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.120]   Insider and all these publications that are giving me all this credit.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.440]   Listen, the president obviously makes the decision.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.760]   He solicits feedback from lots of people.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.160]   I was probably one of a thousand people or at least hundreds of people who offer my opinion.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.600]   Obviously, I'm a big fan of J.D. Vance, but I think it's just giving me way too much credit.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.960]   In all seriousness, Sacks, you're there, and obviously, you know President Trump.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.520]   How is he doing? How's he feeling in the wake of this absolute tragedy?
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.040]   I think he's doing well. He was in great spirits, I think. But let's,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.240]   maybe we should get into the assassination attempt. That's really the thing to talk about here.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.120]   All right, everybody, welcome back to Episode 188 of the All In Podcast. We have a full
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.880]   docket to get through today. We are here on July 18th on the taping of this,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.360]   and it is five days after an assassination attempt on the former president of the United
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.000]   States and the likely 47th president of the United States, obviously President Trump.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.040]   We're going to start with what we know. It's five days later. We're a bit in the
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.720]   fog of war as it is, and there are all the breaking news caveats that you can put on this,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.240]   but I want to recap what we know now about this assassination attempt and get everybody's
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.240]   feedback on it. Last Saturday at a rally in Pennsylvania, 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.560]   Crooks fired eight rounds with an AR-15 at the former president. One bullet nicked Trump's right
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   ear. This was confirmed by the president on Truth Social, and a Trump supporter tragically in the
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   crowd, Corey Comparatore, was killed while protecting his family from gunfire. Two others
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.280]   were critically injured. Crooks was killed by the Secret Service's counter-sniper team 26 seconds
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.080]   after he fired the first shot. He didn't have a criminal record. He was not known to the FBI
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.680]   or Secret Service. He was a registered Republican, but also donated $15 to a progressive PAC,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   and the motive is not known, so we'll just wait for that. There were some leaks from a Senate
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.680]   briefing. I don't know if you gentlemen have heard those. That just came out,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.600]   and it was reported that Crooks wrote on July 13th on Steam, that's a gaming platform,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.480]   "July 13th will be my premiere watch as it unfolds." He had a second phone. He had a
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.040]   detonation device in his pocket, or a bomb, or some sort of explosive device in his car. We'll
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.600]   get details of that, I'm sure. And now we are in the phase of how the hell did this happen?
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.040]   Here's a picture of the rooftop. The closest rooftop was not secured, and it was 130 yards
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.040]   away. The head of the Secret Service said they didn't put anybody on the rooftop because
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:50.080]   of its sloped surface. Obviously, this is being mocked on social media and questioned by journalists
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.880]   and anybody with any IQ points. The most disturbing part of all of this, aside from somebody wanting
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.000]   to murder the president, is the timeline. So ABC News is reporting on the following timeline,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.360]   gentlemen. 5.10 p.m., Crooks was first identified as a POI, person of interest, 5.30. He's spotted
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.840]   with a rangefinder, 5.52. He's spotted on a roof by the Secret Service. 6.02, Trump takes the stage.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.600]   6.12 p.m., he fires his first shot. We'll get into some clips and everything, but let me just stop
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.920]   here and get everybody's reaction to this tragedy. Chamath, your thoughts?
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:37.840]   It's absolute insanity. I actually just, I had just woken up because I was flying back to the
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.800]   United States for a board meeting. And so as I was boarding and on the way, I was just on my way to
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.880]   the airport reading it, mostly from our group chat. And I was, I couldn't, I couldn't believe
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.000]   it, to be totally honest with you. I thought this made, I thought this was, this is not possible in
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.960]   this day and age. And part of why I thought it was not possible was because I had elevated in my mind
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:11.360]   who the Secret Service were and that the job they did or that they're supposed to be doing is just
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:19.120]   so sacrosanct to the well-functioning of America that you only have the absolute best people doing
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:26.560]   that job. And that job is to protect these handful of individuals in America, most importantly being
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.040]   the United, the President of the United States, who are just critical to the functioning of the
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:39.920]   most important country in the world. And when you see the level of negligence and incompetence,
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.720]   you know, my mind started racing, how is it even possible? And
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:56.160]   I guess the the only thing that I can come up with is that we need to figure out where
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.640]   incompetence ended and negligence began in all of this, because I think that's what's
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.720]   going to be the most critical. And we need to figure out the totality of what happened. And,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.320]   you know, if there were other people that supported this guy trying to do this,
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.880]   and then the second, I'll just say is Trump is an absolute legend. What a boss.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.680]   Okay, Freeberg, where were you when the news broke? And what are your general thoughts here
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.600]   five days after this occurred? We'll get into political ramifications and everything else,
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.880]   but just on the event that occurred and your takeaways from it.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.120]   I was with a group of people drinking beer outside. We were on our fourth beer.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.280]   And I thought it was a joke. I think the first thing I thought after I saw the video and saw
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.240]   that he was okay, and that his ear was bleeding was that's it, it's over. Trump's won. It was
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   probably one of the most iconic patriotic visuals I think any of us have seen. And here's the image
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.040]   Nick's pulling up. What a photo. This is the AP photographer. And I think it's really,
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.480]   it was so striking. You see this photo, which didn't come out right away. But some of the
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.000]   imagery that came out right away with him pumping his fist was like, okay, that's it. Trump's won.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.640]   It's over. Second thing I thought was, this could trigger a lot of violent counter reactions.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:19.600]   If Trump doesn't lead well here, and I think he prevented that in his statements. And from the
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.080]   other side. Third thing I thought is it doesn't matter if Biden drops out now, because it's over.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.320]   Biden could stay in, he could leave. This just feels like a lot of momentum.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.720]   And then the fourth thing I thought was this, to Chamath's point, I think we've all been around
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.360]   Secret Service people in our lives and in our careers and in meetings and interactions we've
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.360]   had, it really was amazing that the Secret Service let this happen. And if you see,
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:47.440]   you know, all the data and the stuff that's coming out now about how the Secret Service
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:53.600]   managed this, it seems pretty scary that this was so botched. Certainly, the dust has settled
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.360]   five days later. And it seems like they're back into the conversation about let's remove Biden and
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.920]   figure out who can run against Trump. Although there is conflicting polling data, which I know
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.480]   we're going to get to. Let's get Sax's reaction. Sax, where were you when this occurred? And your
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:13.360]   thoughts on the event itself? And obviously, there's tons of conspiracy theories going around
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.800]   right now. Obviously, there is some negligence that occurred here. I don't think there's any
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:25.200]   doubt about that. There's a DEI angle. There's a ton of angles here. But where were you when you
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.880]   saw this happen? And what was your immediate thought?
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.560]   Yeah, well, let me answer your first question. First, I think this was one of those events where
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.080]   you'll always remember where you were. And I was just working in my office in Los Angeles. I was
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.400]   going to fly to the Republican Convention in Milwaukee a few hours later. And so, someone
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.560]   texted me the President's been shot, Trump had been shot. And my heart sank. I immediately went
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:54.480]   online to see the video. And I think I saw in almost real time him go down. And then when he
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.000]   stood back up and faced the crowd and told the Secret Service, wait, wait, he didn't want to just
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.600]   let them kind of drag him away. He turned to face the crowd and exposed his face. Who knows if
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.480]   there'd been another shooter? Who knows if that shooter was really down. But in that moment, he
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.840]   wanted to let the crowd know that he was fine. We were one inch away from the President of the
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.760]   United States having his head shot. You know, he's got grandkids, he's got a wife, he's got kids,
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.000]   he's got friends, however you feel about the individual, his head was almost shot on television
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.520]   in front of thousands, hundreds, maybe thousands of people on live television.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.560]   And the gravity of this, I think, is very significant. And I think we've, in this media
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.080]   saturated environment, we've processed it too quick, which is why on the docket, I wanted to
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.520]   slow down here and just take in what happened. You know, one other very important detail for
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.040]   me is that, you know, my father-in-law was actually at that rally in Butler, at Butler Farm.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.040]   Really? Yeah, he was there, and he saw everything that happened. And when we saw there was a
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.080]   shooting there, we were trying to get a hold of him, and the cell reception had been shut down,
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.120]   and we couldn't get a hold of him for a couple hours. And obviously, we found out later that he
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   was fine. But what he described is that when the shots rang out, the President went down,
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.560]   there was really a feeling of bedlam and pandemonium in the crowd. The crowd was afraid
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.880]   that the President had been shot. And so when he stood back up and faced the crowd and then,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:21.200]   you know, said, "Fight, fight, fight," it created this huge sense of relief. It was like palpable
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.560]   that he was fine. And then the part that I don't think has been well-reported is that the crowd
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:33.840]   started chanting, "USA, USA, USA." So they responded with this unity. It's been well-reported
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.840]   that, you know, that Trump said, "Fight, fight, fight," but I don't think it's been well-reported
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:45.760]   that the crowd started cheering, "USA, USA, USA." So I think that the crowd turned from fear to
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.680]   unity and strength and patriotism, reflecting what they saw from the President.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.520]   - Yeah, it's well said, yeah.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.240]   - This is one of these things that's unbelievable. And the whole world, I think,
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.680]   has just seen how iconic it is. I saw there's a video online even, and I think kids in Uganda
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.040]   were actually reenacting the assassination attempt. That's how iconic it was. Trump's
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.680]   like a global legend for that. And again, there's just no way to fake what he did in that moment,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:19.520]   right? Where, again, he... I mean, the bullet missing him was either luck or hand of God or
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.920]   destiny, whatever you wanna call it, but him telling the Secret Service to stop, to face the
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:30.320]   crowd, to basically show that he was unharmed and that he was determined and he was defiant in the
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.720]   face of an assassin's bullet, that's courage that nobody can fake. And I've seen people online
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.840]   talk about how soldiers under fire, they've described how when they've been under fire,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.960]   obviously, they hit the deck, they don't stand back up. Even soldiers don't do that.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.480]   - His composure is incredible.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.840]   - Yeah, he just rose to the occasion in just such an incredible way that I think it's inspired
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.480]   the whole country and the whole world. There's just no way, again, to fake something like that,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:02.080]   even though some people like Reid Hoffman's political hack was actually claiming that it
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.760]   was all staged, which is just unbelievably ridiculous. But I think the rest of the world
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.000]   knows that he just showed unbelievable courage in that moment and rose to the occasion and I
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.120]   think made the entire country proud. - It certainly was an amount of bravery
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:24.640]   and a bold response. I do think the next phase of this is sort of figuring out what happened with
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.440]   the Secret Service, as brave as it was for him to stand up. That was a crazy thing to do. I can't
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.880]   believe the Secret Service allowed him to get back up because there could have been a second
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:38.000]   shooter. And although we heard radio chatter that the shooter was down, I mean, how did you know in
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.720]   a situation like this what's actually happening? They could have gotten a second shot off on the
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.920]   president. Maybe they don't miss by an inch that time and then they hit it. So we got a lot of
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.040]   questions that need to be answered here. Thank God he's okay. And I think, I guess,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.880]   now it's time to talk about rhetoric. And I think that's actually, from my perspective,
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.240]   the next thing that has to happen here in terms of leadership, when something this tragic happens,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.400]   everybody's looking at the other side's rhetoric here, whether it's putting Trump on a magazine
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.680]   cover as Hitler, or they're saying you gotta fight like hell, or the Oath Keepers and all this
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.400]   January 6th nonsense and beating up cops. I think we have to put both of these things aside and the
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:27.520]   leadership, Trump and Biden, should be saying right now that, and leadership does start at the top,
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.600]   this rhetoric is not to be done anymore. People have to tone things down. You could be passionate
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.000]   about politics, but using violent language, there are sick people in the world and this kid, I think
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   it will ultimately turn out like all the other assassins we've seen or these celebrity killings
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.320]   that occur, John Lennon, et cetera, it's usually a mentally ill person. Likely what happened here,
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:54.560]   we don't know yet. They interpret violent language differently than a normal person.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.320]   So we could say fight like hell, or target, or you gotta fight for your country, whatever it is,
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.240]   and we would take it a certain way. Sick people take it a different way and they need to put out
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.000]   a joint statement and just say, anybody on our teams who uses violent rhetoric is no longer on
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.680]   our teams and they haven't done that. So I think there's more work to be done here in terms of
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.240]   leadership. - I think it's more precise than that. I think it's way more precise than this. I don't
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:24.320]   think that this is like years of Donald Trump using violent rhetoric. I think this is years of-
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.320]   - Oh, both sides. - No, I don't. You cannot both
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.200]   sides this. I think this is years- - Of course you can. I just gave you
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.440]   examples of it. - I think what it is,
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:37.280]   is that we have gone through years and years of literally the words that the former president
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:43.600]   has said being perverted, and misconstrued, and chopped up into soundbites that advance
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:51.600]   the mainstream media's agenda to try to vilify a person. And I think that that's an important
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:59.040]   thing to take a step back. I think we have to understand that the mainstream media has really
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:08.480]   gone out of their way to amplify violent rhetoric and to actually associate violent rhetoric as a
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.360]   tolerable reaction. And I think that that is the thing that we need to now
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:23.040]   completely get rid of in our society. I saw so many reactions to the former and probably
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.200]   future president of the United States getting shot, which was along the lines of basically
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:35.440]   hoping that that person hadn't missed, and/or justifying that violence on Donald Trump was
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:42.080]   somehow justified. That's insane. Now that person could only have gotten that idea because the media
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:49.040]   fed them that language and that idea. And I think that that's extremely scary because I don't think
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:56.160]   you actually see Republicans necessarily saying that about Joe Biden. They may think that Joe
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:03.360]   Biden is feeble and mentally incompetent, but nobody's calling for the death of Joe Biden.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.400]   So I think that that's a very scary place where you have one group of people who are being fed
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.720]   this extremely toxic narrative. And I think that that part of what you're saying, Jason, I agree
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.480]   with, but I really disagree with the other part, which is, and this is someone again, as as someone
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.280]   who was a former Democrat, I can observe this and be relatively rational here. I didn't see that
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.800]   from the other side. Okay, well, you know, the media is reflecting what is said by both candidates
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.360]   and both sides, and they both use very targeted language. I'll put a couple of links in the show
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.000]   notes of both sides doing this, and you can make your own decision as the audience. But I do think
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.720]   leadership would be both of them saying, "Stop this violent language," and both sides do it.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.000]   I'd like to address that, too.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.120]   Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.320]   Just days before the shooting, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman had an exchange
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.640]   at Allen & Company that was publicly reported in which Peter said that Reid had turned Trump into
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.720]   a martyr by funding lawfare. And Reid responded, "I wish I had turned him into an actual martyr."
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:13.200]   Okay, that's wishing for someone's death. When the news of the assassination attempt came online,
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.920]   I don't think it was Jack Black himself, but a member of his band said, "That's too bad.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.800]   The shot missed." There are other people on the Democrat side who expressed similar sentiments.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:28.640]   They were disappointed that the assassination attempt had failed. Now, I don't think those
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.720]   people are mainstream political leaders.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.000]   Yeah, that's just a distinction I wanted to make here. There's no political leader who said that.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.080]   I'm not going to try and hang that around Joe Biden. However, Biden himself, days before the
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.280]   shooting, said that it was time to put Trump in the bullseye. That's what he said. And his defense
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.640]   for that rhetoric was, "Well, I didn't say crosshairs." Well, I think bullseye means the
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:55.520]   same thing. Now, even that, I'm willing to basically forgive because I don't think Biden
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.960]   meant it in a literal sense. I think he was speaking rhetorically about, say, campaign ads,
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.880]   things like that. I wouldn't necessarily say that was violent rhetoric, okay? I'm not going to try
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:11.680]   and pin that on President Biden. But the thing I do think was unacceptable by President Biden
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:17.440]   and the Democrats is the level of demonization and the level of vitriol that they have pursued
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:23.440]   against President Trump, not as a one-off statement, but as a campaign strategy. Again,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.600]   they have said over and over again, "This man is Hitler. This man is a fascist. This
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.360]   man is a threat to democracy. If he wins, it is the end of democracy." They have repeatedly gone
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:39.920]   there and repeatedly used... They've tried to Hitlerize him. Now, if you're saying that this
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.880]   man is Hitler, where else is there to go rhetorically? That's the worst thing you could
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:51.200]   ever say about somebody. And quite frankly, if he is Hitler, why would you be offering him thoughts
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:57.360]   and prayers after he gets shot? I mean, wouldn't it be a good thing to shoot Hitler? And so,
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.840]   I do think that if we think about the contribution of political rhetoric to what could have happened
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.880]   here, I'm not going to try and blame anybody for these one-off poor choices of language that could
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:13.200]   be interpreted as violent. What I will blame them for is taking the demonization up to 11,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:20.000]   taking the vitriol up to 11, because that could poison the mind of someone who's already mentally
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.480]   disturbed and say, "Okay, well, wait a second. If he is Hitler, why wouldn't I be Colonel Van
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.920]   Stauffenberg for assassinating him? Wouldn't I be a hero for trying to eliminate this man?"
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.400]   And that's the thing that I think is really unacceptable. And I do think the Democrats
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.440]   should be blamed for that because, again, they made it a campaign strategy. Their entire argument
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.160]   against Donald Trump is not about issues. It's about this man being Hitler. And I think it's
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:51.120]   ridiculous. It's inflated. It's hyperbole, to be sure. And I think that we don't know yet
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.960]   about the mind of this shooter, this Brooks. But if anything contributed to the shooting, it was
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.440]   that. Jay D. Vance referred to him as Hitler as well. Other people inside the Republican
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.120]   Party have referred to him as Hitler and a threat to democracy. So, there's plenty of
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.040]   blame to go around to, correct, Sax? That happened over eight years ago as, like,
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.400]   part of a text message exchange. It wasn't a public rhetoric as a campaign strategy. I'm
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.920]   talking about a systematic strategy that gets amplified. Look at the cover of "The New Republic."
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:26.720]   They literally turned Donald Trump's face into the face of mashup of him and Adolf Hitler. And it's
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:33.840]   been amplified and repeated over and over and over again on MSNBC, on CNN, on all these liberal
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.960]   channels, okay? This is coordinated political rhetoric as a campaign strategy. It's not a
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.000]   one-off. I'm not gonna blame anybody for a one-off that could be misinterpreted. But when you do this
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.320]   as a systematic campaign strategy, and, in fact, you base your entire campaign around the idea
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.640]   of this man as a threat to democracy and a fascist, this is the language they used. Like I said,
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.440]   there's nowhere else to go after that. Where else do you go?
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:04.960]   Jay: Threat to democracy, I think, is a valid criticism of Trump calling him Hitler. Probably
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:10.880]   insightful. So, yeah, I think reasonable people can parse this. And it is something that has
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.960]   occurred on both sides. It's well documented. And both parties can do better.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.720]   Alex: I think, like, one thing that when the investigation happens into what happened here,
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:26.880]   and we really figure out what happened in the Secret Service, how many examples do we need
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:33.520]   of institutions where we put in our trust just, like, letting us down? And they just seem to be
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.560]   piling up. And it's independent of administration. And at some point, I think we have to, like,
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:44.000]   really check ourselves and say, what has happened here? Like, how do we objectively measure the
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.680]   quality of the people that are supposed to be working in these organizations? And how do we
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.160]   make sure that they are actually competent in doing their job?
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.680]   Jay: I think this is the key point, Srimath, is the outcome. You know, how do we judge people?
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.960]   Outcomes. And if you look at the outcome, how the Secret Service director hasn't resigned now. I
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.600]   mean, I know she's had a storied career, and she's probably a good person who's done plenty of great
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.800]   things in her career. I don't know the details of it. But if the outcome of what you've done results
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.760]   in something this tragic, and that could have been avoided, the proper thing is ownership
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.360]   and resignation, and or the people who run this organization or the answer to being fired. And so
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.600]   this absolute acceptance of mediocrity is something that has to change.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.400]   Srimath: Is it an acceptance of mediocrity? Or is it that they just got completely distracted on
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.840]   things that are not germane to doing your job? So, you know, if it was we need
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:45.680]   a diverse Secret Service, or we need to have inclusion, all of those things have nothing to
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.680]   do in my mind about protecting somebody, there are characteristics, and I suspect that there are
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.600]   women that embody these characteristics as much as men that embody these characteristics.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.240]   But why isn't there a psychographic way of determining who the best people are that have
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.160]   the protective instinct to protect the most important people that run our country?
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.320]   There's a very simple test here. The job of the Secret Service is to jump in front of a bullet,
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.560]   as we witnessed, in order to jump in front of a bullet, you have to be bigger than the target,
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:15.120]   right? You have to be so a six foot two woman who's four feet wide, just as qualified as a
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.880]   man who's six foot two, four feet wide. For that job description, you have to be brave enough to
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   jump in front of a bullet. I don't know if you guys saw but there was like a thing where and
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.920]   I feel bad for this woman who's being derided as being totally incompetent, the one in the field,
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.480]   but there was a David Attenborough voiceover of her trying to put her gun back in the holster.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.320]   Yeah, I mean, my gosh. Apparently, I think Eric Trump said she's incredible.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.640]   Have you seen the DEI Another Day memes? Yeah, this is just sad.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.240]   I mean, look, it's a very unfortunate video. Didn't Eric Trump say that she's like the best
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.480]   person ever? I think he was trying to support her. She may have just had a bad moment, who knows? I
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.040]   mean, it did look pretty bad that she was having trouble holstering her weapon. I mean, you know,
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.080]   not that I'm a gun expert. A lot of adrenaline running at that moment in time.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.840]   But I mean, look, it's what's known as an outside the waistband holster, which is the
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.440]   easiest type of holster to use because you don't have to tuck it into your pants or anything like
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:11.120]   that. And I got to say, it does look pretty bad that she was having so much trouble just
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.800]   trying to holster her weapon. But look, I think this is only one of a number of questions that
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.520]   I think have been legitimately raised about the Secret Service performance. And we need
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.760]   a full investigation to figure out what happened. And let me just, you know, let me just run off a
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.000]   list of questions that I would like to see answered. So number one is how did they fail
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.280]   to cover that roof? It was the most obvious shooting spot in that entire Butler Farm area,
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:42.240]   and it was not properly covered. And then the Secret Service releases the statement that they
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.200]   didn't cover it because it was a sloped roof, which is the most ridiculous cover story ever
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.560]   because they did have snipers on another roof that was more sloped.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.080]   And that's like five times more slope. Right, right. So that sounds like a lie.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:00.640]   So once you put out that, that cover story, which is basically a lie, you only make the situation
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.520]   worse. And it only makes the question even more poignant of how do you fail to cover that roof?
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.280]   Okay, well, did you see the picture of Secret Service on top of the White House roof, which
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.400]   is extremely even more sloped than the I mean, it's just pretty good. And the Secret Service
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:20.320]   director Cheadle said that on ABC. Okay, so right there, she should be fired because she's lying to
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.800]   us at a moment where she should be cooperating and doing a full investigation. Okay, so isn't
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:30.480]   it true that they were inside the the structure was air conditioned inside the building outside
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:35.680]   it was. Okay, but that's just question number one. Okay. Question number two is, like you said,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.120]   he was a person of interest an hour before the shooting. And no one went to go resolve that
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:46.400]   situation. Moreover, they see him with a rangefinder. Okay, what the hell do you use a
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.000]   rangefinder for? I mean, he's scoping out the target with a rangefinder. And they let the
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.800]   president go out there. Okay, while they stole a person of interest out there, this guy has a
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.680]   rangefinder, he has a ladder, he has a backpack, and he was never intercepted. He was never stopped,
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.360]   even though they had identified him, and they let the president go out there. So clearly,
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.440]   there was a huge failure of communication between the Secret Service and the Trump campaign. How
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:15.040]   did that happen? How was there no agent stationed at the fence, such that they had to ram it with an
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.800]   SUV for the Secret Service to get through? I don't know if you guys knew about that part of it. Okay,
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:25.760]   there was no agent stationed at the fence. Okay, so in order to get there, they rammed the fence
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:31.120]   with an SUV. So the Secret Service quickly get through. Oh, my gosh. Okay, that's insane.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.760]   And what harm would have come from just taking a half hour and have Trump have a cup of coffee
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.960]   and then go make sure that this person is not exactly like exactly. I'm just thinking judgment
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.640]   wise. Listen, I understand they're in the field. I understand they have. I understand if like they
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.520]   were concerned, maybe that's one of our snipers on the roof. Like maybe there was a moment like
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.000]   a 30 second moment. Like, I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here. But it's hard to
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   the Secret Service sniper who did an incredible job taking out the shooter in one shot. Okay,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.920]   he had that person lined up. So again, you know, why haven't they released that the audio,
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.080]   there must be an audio recording of all the chatter on their earpieces, their communication.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.800]   A hundred percent.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.080]   That sniper must have identified, you know, Crooks as a potential target and had him lined up,
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:23.520]   which is how he's able to take him out very quickly. But what was the chain of command
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.600]   there in terms of him seeking authorization? Hey, who is this person? Why wasn't everything
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.080]   stop while they go to figure out what this person is doing on the roof there? Okay. And then once,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:38.880]   once the shots rang out and, and Trump gets shot, why did it take him so long to get him in the car
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.680]   to get the convoy off to a hospital? There was a long delay in terms of getting him out of there.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.800]   So they clearly weren't prepared for that. The whole thing, it just, you know, reeks of,
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.480]   of incompetence.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.400]   Yeah. And they don't have a great track record of being honest about what's going on. They don't
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.200]   remember not to bring up January 6th again, but they deleted all their texts from January 6th.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.080]   Like they do not, they circle the wagons. They do not want people criticizing. I doubt we're
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.840]   even going to get that audio. I wonder if that audio is going to come out.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.000]   But they don't have the right in a democracy to basically investigate themselves and say,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.040]   oh, we're good. No, that's not how it works. The people of this country need accountability.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.480]   I mean,
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:24.480]   the once and likely future president came within millimeters, centimeters of being
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.400]   assassinated. And this whole country could have been plunged into a whole different type of
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:34.080]   situation. We need answers to these questions. And this director Cheadle is obviously in the way
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:40.960]   and putting out nonsense, putting out spin at a time when we need a proper investigation.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.920]   That needs to happen immediately. Cheadle should resign. We need to have agents, okay? Secret
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.680]   service agents need to be offered up to testify on Capitol Hill with no fear of reprisal from the
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.440]   Biden administration. Okay. And all the information needs to be made available.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.000]   The first person that needs to talk that needs to speak
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.880]   in a congressional hearing is the sniper himself.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.560]   Did you guys see there was coverage yesterday that showed there's actually two snipers?
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.360]   Yeah, there's two.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.440]   Well, no, sorry. There's two sets of snipers. There's four snipers.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.560]   The one set of snipers that you see the video of where he does that,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.800]   there's a tree blocking their ability to see crooks. The other set of snipers are the ones
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.520]   that apparently took the fatal shot. And they had a line of sight, but they're not on camera.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:30.160]   So you don't actually see what's going on with them. That's the current reporting I've seen on
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.560]   it. So I don't want to, like jump to conclusions, given that there's now seeming to be...
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.040]   There's no excuse here, because let me just say...
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.480]   If they saw the guy on the roof, and they let the president on the stage,
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.400]   someone effed up. That doesn't seem appropriate.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.040]   Why not have a delay? Not the end of the world.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.680]   If we can put that bird's eye view of Butler Farm on the screen. I don't know, Nick,
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.400]   if you have that.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.920]   Nick, pull it up where it shows the line of sight with the tree as well, so you can see it all.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.720]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.760]   But look at the shooter's position and look at Trump's position, okay? And I've seen
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:05.360]   broader bird's eye views of Butler Farm. Without knowing anything about marksmanship,
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.960]   it's just obvious that that roof is the most... If you could set yourself up anywhere as a sniper...
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.080]   Yeah, it's the number one location.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.800]   ...to assassinate the president, it's the number one most obvious location.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.040]   Furthermore, let me just say that when Chamath and I hosted that dinner for President Trump,
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:24.560]   we worked with the Secret Service advance team, and they were excellent. They were really great.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.720]   And I saw just a little bit of their process. And they went through the house, they mapped
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.800]   out the entire house, the entire property. Then they asked, "Well, where's the president
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.240]   gonna be sitting at dinner?" They wanted to know who's to his right, who's to his left.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.280]   They looked at the window coverage of that room, and they said, "Okay, whose house is that? That
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:46.560]   neighbor's house." And they went to go check it out. Every single movement by the president was
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.520]   mapped out. Every angle on the president was basically mapped out and explored.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.920]   What happened here then? That's the crazy part.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.480]   It was actually amazing to watch. I thought they did a great job.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.200]   It was really amazing.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.920]   And so this is why, how could this ever have happened, where the most obvious shooting angle
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.840]   on the president was not properly covered? It just makes no sense.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   You can put two blues up there. Just two beat officers on there would have solved the whole
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:15.680]   problem. If you don't have enough Secret Service agents. I was at a Clinton benefit one time,
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.840]   and I got detained in the Secret Service and went into secondary screening.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.600]   The reason given, I had two cell phones on me. They thought it was peculiar that I had
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.480]   two cell phones. They kept me for 15, 20 minutes in a side room, and they literally took my phone
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.880]   apart in front of me, took all the batteries out, went through every bag. They frisked me.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.440]   I mean, wanded me. Three guys around me. They take this incredibly seriously.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.400]   Yeah. Normally, they're very thorough, and they're very serious. I mean, look,
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.680]   even at the dinner that we hosted, they wanted to know what kind of steak knives we were using.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:50.160]   Literally, they wanted to make sure that that was safe. And this is why they were so interested in
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.840]   knowing who was to the president's right and to his left, because they want to think through every
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.160]   possible angle of attack on the president.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.200]   There was some breakdown here.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.960]   And in this case, something very strange happened.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:10.240]   And of course, as I was just sort of alluding to early, if this person looked like a SWAT member,
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.080]   which apparently he did, fatigues, rangefinder, all that stuff, I'm guessing that maybe those
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.240]   snipers from the Secret Service thought those were friendlies. That's the only possible
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.760]   explanation of why they paused.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:27.440]   Yeah, but he wasn't dressed that way. He wasn't wearing a costume, or he wasn't impersonating.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.480]   I thought he had fatigues. But even still, a person laying there...
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.680]   The photo I saw, he was wearing a t shirt.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.360]   The great fear you have as a police officer is shooting another police officer. So I
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.000]   think that...
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.440]   Dude, he was not in a uniform.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.840]   From whatever number of feet away, maybe that's what they thought.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.360]   Can I ask a technical question?
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:52.960]   Are you telling me in 2024, that when you show up at an event to protect a VVVIP,
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.480]   like the President of the United States,
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:03.360]   that SWAT and other people aren't given some kind of like, little pin that has an NFC chip
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.320]   or something where everybody knows who everybody is so that it's very clear very quickly when
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.040]   somebody in a position of risk is not on the home team?
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.600]   They do have ways of doing that, right? There is a when you're undercover...
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.760]   Like are you telling me, for example, like President Trump's pin or Barack Obama's pin
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   or Joe Biden's pin doesn't actually have something in it? I would be shocked if the
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.280]   answer is it's just a pin.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:35.280]   Well, this is a report that they're investigating that the delay in shooting the sniper might have
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.120]   been that they thought it was friendly. So this theory is out there now. And it's part
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.440]   of the investigation. It is a potential one. You know, I can tell you that that would be
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.440]   the nightmare scenario for the Secret Service is to shoot the local cop.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.880]   Honestly, guys, I hate to be the one to say this, but we've just, our institutions are
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.760]   incompetent.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.720]   There's a lot of incompetence.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:58.400]   Absolutely. It's just like the Afghanistan withdrawal. Remember that? No heads rolled,
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.120]   there was no proper investigation of why so many people died unnecessarily in that Afghanistan
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:03.520]   withdrawal.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.000]   Nobody's fired for anything anymore. It's just ridiculous. Like, and there's no resigning,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.920]   obviously, nobody resigns, nobody gets fired.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:17.120]   Why would anybody so if this was a company, this would be a failing company? Why would you not
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.360]   strip it down from top to bottom and rebuild it?
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.640]   Well, exactly. And I tweeted this counterfactual, which is imagine if Elon had bought Twitter,
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.800]   but he wasn't allowed to fire anybody. Do you think he would have been able to restore free
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.360]   speech? Do you think he'd be able to restore innovation? No. If you're running an institution,
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:39.360]   you have to be able to fire people when they don't perform. But we have lost that ability
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.360]   of our federal government. So there's something that's very, very broken here. When people fail,
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.680]   they have to be held accountable or you don't get good performance.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.480]   Right? When institutions fail, there needs to be a question on why are we funding those
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:52.960]   institutions?
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.640]   Nobody gets fired.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.160]   Why would you give more money to a failing company? You'd never do it.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.800]   This is the comment I put in the letter that I sent to that senior democrat back in October.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:07.760]   I don't see any accountability with respect to the programs that you pass bills to fund.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.320]   You pass bills to fund these programs, you stand up new institutions. And then there is never a
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.400]   retrospective postmortem or review on the performance of those institutions or the
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.320]   objective of those programs. And yet we keep funding them and asking for more money.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:25.200]   And eventually you end up with a decaying empire. Like we've seen in history, we need to have a
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:30.960]   series of actions that drive accountability in federal programs, and then a review on the
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.360]   intention of those programs, and make sure that they still hold. And then we can move forward
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.480]   with new programs.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.640]   Sachs is really right. Like you cannot have the Secret Service investigate themselves on this one.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.440]   Of course not. And they deleted all their text messages and did a major
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.040]   cover-up the last time around. So you cannot trust them to investigate themselves. No.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.080]   Did you see all those senators chasing them up the stairs yesterday?
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:50.560]   You see that?
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.640]   I did see that. It didn't say which senators it was. I don't know if that was confirmed.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:54.960]   It was, yeah.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.000]   Marcia Blackburn.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.480]   What happened?
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:02.000]   So a bunch of the senators confronted the head of the Secret Service. Cheetle is her name, right?
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.080]   And they confronted her and there was someone's video of the whole thing on their iPhone
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.960]   of them saying, "We need answers. Why did you let this happen?"
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.280]   Here it is.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.680]   Here's the video. Nick can show it. Here, just watch it.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:22.400]   This was an assassination attempt. You owe the people answers. You owe President Trump answers.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.440]   My gosh.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.640]   That's a bad video because what it does not show is the start and the end.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:31.200]   At the start, they were all standing around her having a conversation. And then they started to
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   press her and she said, "Now's not the time. This isn't the forum." Then she took off. They
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.560]   followed her. And then she went into the Secret Service secure room upstairs and blocked all the
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.800]   senators from coming into the room. Her Secret Service staff blocked them. So all the guards
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.960]   said, "No, you can't come in." So they all got blocked out. So the senators were pushing her
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.640]   for some feedback, for conversation, for dialogue, and she wouldn't engage.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.760]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:59.280]   I've seen enough. Resign now. Get out of the way so a proper investigation can be done.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.560]   Total, total, total.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:08.800]   Okay. Let's talk about the RNC. A friend of ours gave a talk and the VP was selected.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.080]   You did a great job, Bestie.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.440]   Thank you.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:16.880]   What was it like to get on that stage? I have a bunch of questions about-
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.160]   Yeah. What was it like?
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.400]   It seemed like people are not sitting in chairs, right? They're just mulling about. Tell us-
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.760]   Give us the behind the scenes.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.920]   And what was it like getting prepped and doing all the prep work?
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.480]   Did you have to review your speech? Tell us all the details.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.680]   Well, let's see. I mean, I started working on this about, I don't know, a week before
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:40.000]   the convention and they sent me some ideas for remarks and then I completely rewrote it with my
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.400]   research assistant/writer and then sent it to them and there was some back and forth. But by and
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.880]   large, they let me do what I wanted to do.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.800]   Did they give you a time?
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:56.640]   Yeah. The one thing that was kind of set was the time and they correlated the time with a number
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.920]   of words. So they said, "You've got six minutes," which is 600 words. And so that's what we worked
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:07.120]   towards. And then the big thing I had to learn was just how to use the teleprompter. So they had
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:14.560]   these rooms set up where there were teleprompters and I could do some training on how to read a
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   speech using a teleprompter.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.560]   What is that like? Like you'd say?
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:24.000]   It's just a matter of knowing where to look and trying to stay natural, but also using
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.400]   the prompter as a mnemonic device.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.080]   And does the prompter stop when you stop or how does that work?
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:34.000]   There is actually somebody in the room who is physically advancing the words as you're
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.080]   speaking. And so there's someone who's actually working the prompter and they will go out-
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.240]   So if you give big applause, they'll pause it for you and you don't have to try to keep up.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:48.320]   Exactly. So that was probably the biggest thing to learn. And then the other thing about it is
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:54.240]   that you're speaking to a huge convention hall. And so you feel like you really want to project
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:00.240]   in order to reach people. But at the same time, you're really speaking on TV. As you guys know,
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:06.160]   you'll come across as being kind of insane if you start yelling into a TV set. So finding
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.400]   the right balance between speaking to people in the auditorium and speaking to people watching
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.360]   from home, that's kind of tricky. And I'm reasonably happy with it. And the most important
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.920]   thing is I got to say the substance of what I said.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:23.600]   Not universally popular, right? I mean, you basically called for an end to the conflict
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:30.400]   in Ukraine and to stop funding Ukraine's defense against Russia. And that's not a popular opinion
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.080]   in the Republican Party. Is that right? Well, I went further than that. I said that
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.240]   this was not an unprovoked war. It was a provoked war. I said the Biden administration provoked the
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.560]   war with talk of NATO expansion. You can disagree with that if you want. I think there's plenty of
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.640]   evidence for it. That's what I believe. I feel like you went out on a limb more than most other
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.640]   speakers who kind of had a lot of good laudatory comments and promoted Trump.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.720]   Yeah, you could have pandered. Yeah, you actually went out with a strongly held opinion
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:02.720]   that is, you know, fairly contrarian, right? Well, I think that most of the people in the
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   Republican Party, including most people on the floor, actually agreed with me. I think it took
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:13.520]   them a second to process what I had said. And so, you know, what I saw when I was up there is I said
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:19.680]   that, you know, Biden provoked, yes, provoked the war. And I think it was such a shocking statement
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.240]   to a lot of people because we've heard the whole unprovoked invasion narrative so many times that
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.080]   there were like murmurs, and then people got it and they started applauding. I never actually
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.520]   intended it to even be an applause line. I just thought it was an important thing to state the
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:37.120]   truth as I see it on the record at the Republican convention. And that line did actually get
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:42.640]   applause. Now, a bunch of Ukraine stans were predictably outraged by what I said, and they
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.920]   were trying to claim online that somehow I'd been booed or something like that. There were absolutely
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.000]   no boos. There were actually people applauding. And then, you know, as I got deeper and deeper
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   into the speech, people applauded it more and more. It was very much a speech that attacked
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.600]   the forever wars. It attacked the warmongers and complimented President Trump for keeping us out of
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:06.800]   wars and complimented him for being strong, but also having the savviness and the ability to
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.120]   negotiate with our adversaries to keep us out of wars. And I think that's now a position that's
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.240]   very popular within the Republican Party. But it's a process. It's evolving.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:21.040]   This is a perfect segue because there are reports that friend of the pod Tucker Carlson
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:26.000]   had a big impact on talking to Trump about his selection of JD Vance and said, "Don't pick a
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.600]   neocon. That'll get you assassinated." That was one report. That was advice that came before the
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.760]   assassination attempt, obviously, so conspiracy theorists are kind of losing their minds over
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:42.240]   this. But let's talk about the selection of JD Vance because that is a big surprise, I think,
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.120]   in many quarters. Tell us about JD Vance. You're friends, yeah?
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:52.480]   I mean, I'm friends with him and I very much supported his selection for VP.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.480]   Why is he the best pick in your mind?
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.120]   Well, there's a couple of things. So JD Vance represents a couple of very interesting
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:05.840]   characteristics. On the one hand, he's from this poor region of Appalachia that really represents
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:12.720]   the forgotten man or the forgotten cities and towns in America. You could call it the MAGA
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.680]   heartland. And so MAGA really likes him. At the same time, he's worked in tech. He was a venture
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.960]   capitalist. He understands the future and he's popular in tech. So it's very unusual to get
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:29.680]   somebody who has MAGA plus tech on their side together. So that's one almost contradiction,
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.640]   you could say, that JD represents. Here's another one. JD Vance was in high school
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:42.000]   when the Twin Towers came down. And then we invaded Iraq and he was gung-ho to serve and
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.240]   to go exact retribution and justice on America's enemies. And he enlisted in the Marine Corps and
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:54.560]   he went off to serve in the Iraq War. Subsequently, he realized that we had all been lied to about the
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:43:00.000]   Iraq War and that it was a gigantic mistake. And moreover, the forever wars were a huge mistake.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.880]   And to me, this is something that I really appreciate about him. And this is a quality
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:10.240]   that I really want at President Trump's side, which is he's an American patriot. He had the
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:15.760]   courage to serve, to go serve in America's wars, but he has the wisdom and the judgment
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.320]   to want to avoid those wars when we don't need to fight them. And there's way too many of,
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.880]   like you said, Jason, these neocons, these warmongers in the party, who've never ever
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:30.560]   acknowledged their mistake in the Iraq War and all the forever wars. And they seem on virtually a
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:36.720]   daily basis to want to plunge us into the next forever war. So this is, I think, a quality that's
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.920]   of paramount importance to have in our commander in chief and in the person who would be next in
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:46.800]   line to be commander in chief. So for these reasons, I very much support J.D.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.160]   All right. So let me get some feedback from the rest of the panel. I'll just give you a
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.640]   couple of bullet points about him. For those of you who don't know J.D. Vance, yeah, he worked at
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:59.840]   Peter Thiel's mythical capital and Steve Case's revolution. And so he worked for a Republican and
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:07.840]   a Democrat. And Steve Case started his own farm called Naria Capital. And he went to Ohio State,
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.720]   graduated Yale, was actually classmates with Vivek. We talked about that. He's only 39 years
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.160]   old. So he's half the age of Trump. As you mentioned, combat correspondent for six months
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:23.360]   in Iraq in 2005, 39 years old. And Thiel backed him with, I think, the largest Senate race donation
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:31.600]   in history, 15 million. And so this is quite a ascension chamath from a venture capitalist to
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:37.120]   potentially vice president and obviously, potentially president. He's in the second
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:43.840]   spot. So were you a proponent of the J.D. Vance as well? He's superb. The press says you lobby
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:49.600]   Trump as well. Is that true? He's superb. I cannot say enough good things about this guy.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:59.200]   He's superb. Why is he superb? He is a, he's a bit of an enigma, I think, as Sak said, because he,
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:08.080]   his views are so unique. And he comes from a background that is very similar to mine. So I
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:15.280]   have tremendous loyalty for the path that he had to navigate to get out just to get out. And I think
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:22.640]   that that, you know, I really care for people like that. And then he's done really good things with
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.960]   the resources that he's been given, and the relationships that he's built. And I really
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.760]   respect that, too. We all read Hillbilly allergy. I don't know if we talked about it on this pod
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:40.160]   years ago, but you and I certainly talked about it a bunch of months. And, you know, he came from
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:46.240]   nothing, less than nothing, less than nothing addicts, less than nothing. And he talks a lot
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.160]   in his book, I don't know if you remember this about social capital, and the fact that he didn't
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.400]   understand by the name of the firm is social capital, people know the reference that he just
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:59.440]   didn't have the social capital to even understand that a lawyer went to law school. Totally. And,
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:04.880]   you know, he is an enigma. His positions don't align with Trump's in every case,
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.920]   but they have quickly become aligned with Trump's. He's an incredible pick now. Yeah,
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.480]   I thought he was an incredible pick before his speech last night. And he even exceeded my
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.440]   expectations in that speech. I just thought it was truly an incredible speech. First of all,
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:24.640]   the introduction by his wife, Usha was really, you know, incredible. I thought she did a fantastic
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:30.240]   job. And then he got up there and I had a friend text me, he's not really that into politics. He's
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.200]   just like, this guy seems so normal. He's happy. He's normal. He seems competent. There was one
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:40.160]   commentator, I think on one of the cable shows, who I think meant this as an insult,
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.480]   but it actually was positive. He said that when you're at like a fast food restaurant,
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.920]   something and need to ask for the manager, JD advances, the person you hope is the manager,
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.920]   you know, he comes out, he's friendly, he's competent, he's reasonable.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.920]   He knows how to get stuff done. I'm not sure if that was meant as an insult or a compliment.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.760]   I can tell you. Yeah, but I think it's a compliment, right? And he's just so normal.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.040]   He's gonna be very hard to demonize. Obviously, they're trying to do it on cable news. They're
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:13.600]   somehow trying to portray him as an extremist or a racist, even though he has a mixed race family.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:19.840]   The tent of the Republican Party at this RNC sacks is the most wide open tent I've ever seen
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:24.000]   in politics. They had Amber Rose and people were criticizing Amber Rose. She was excellent.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.200]   She was excellent. She was fantastic. I thought she was excellent. She knocked the ball out of
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.840]   the park and she's she looked absolutely radiant. She's a feminist. She was beautiful and she
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.480]   crushed it. I thought her speech was effective. I thought it was authentic. And it would describe
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:41.120]   her red pilling. Basically, she said it described her evolution and her journey from someone who
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:45.760]   believed the media's lies about Trump thinking that he was a racist to actually meeting the man
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:53.360]   herself, realizing that the way they had portrayed him was basically a slander and how she became
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.520]   friends with President Trump. I thought it was an incredibly effective speech. But look, there
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:03.360]   was very few people who didn't like it. There was this one post by Matt Walsh online, and he was
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.320]   roundly denounced for what he said. I mean, he kind of engaged in this pearl clutching that they'd
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.600]   allowed Amber Rose to speak because of her value judging. And it's like, who's Matt Walsh to judge?
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:18.400]   It felt like a part of the Republican Party that's on its way out, you know,
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:23.040]   this pearl clutching social conservatism. In any event, it was it was really an opportunity,
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.960]   I think, for people to disavow his criticism and support her.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:32.320]   Yeah, and that was my point here is what, you know, they've done a really great job of. And
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.880]   Vape did a wonderful job in his talk. I want to give him a shout out of just saying, hey, listen,
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.480]   everybody can be part of this party. I think there's a lot of notes the Democrats could take
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.680]   from what they saw at the Republican National Convention. These are people
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:49.360]   who would have been at the DNC, but you know, one election cycle ago, but because of this purity
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:54.320]   test, you can't even, you know, win with them. Let's take the obvious, we're trending into a
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:49:01.440]   direction right now, where based on Donald Trump's pick for the Vice President, and some of the other
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:08.320]   surrogates like Vivek, if Donald Trump were to win, what you're going to see is a very youthful
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:15.440]   cabinet of a lot of 30 somethings and 40 somethings. And I think that that's a really
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:21.440]   important thing to consider versus a bunch of 60 70 and 80 year old career politicians.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.720]   Correct. Absolutely.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.480]   Youth and vigor. And again, this new direction, you know, a lot of people were commenting
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:32.160]   about JD speech that large parts of it could have been given by Bernie Sanders, or, you know,
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.960]   it's it's this populist message that
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:40.720]   Well, let me ask you that. Yes, axis, he, he's had a position of breaking up big tech,
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:48.080]   and being pro union. How do you reconcile all that? And this new Republican Party? Yeah,
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.920]   address those two, because that seems to be a big discussion to discussion topics.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:59.360]   Yeah, I think that it's definitely a new emergent Republican Party where this is, I think this is
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:04.240]   Donald Trump's Republican Party. This is the MAGA wing, the America first wing of the Republican
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:10.640]   Party, we're moving from a party of basically the Chamber of Commerce, you know, business roundtable,
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:16.240]   a bunch of oligarchic fat cats to being a populist party that actually represents the people.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:21.280]   And I think it's a very, I think, and they had the teamsters up there. Yeah. And I think it's
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:26.640]   a very welcome change. And the part of JD speech that I like the best is when he described that,
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.960]   hey, I went off and many other people went off to fight in these forever wars,
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:35.760]   risking our lives or giving our lives, we come back to our home communities. And what do we find,
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:40.240]   we find them hollowed out, the jobs have all been exported, the factories have shut down.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:45.280]   And instead, the town has been poisoned by fentanyl. That is a message that you have not
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:50.320]   heard in the Republican Party, except for Donald Trump, and that new part of the party. And I think
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:56.240]   that Donald Trump choosing JD Vance was so important to cement this new vision of the Republican Party.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:02.080]   It was a legacy pick, because it means that this America first MAGA message is going to continue
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:06.720]   into the future, many years into the future. And let me just tell you, as I listened to that
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:14.640]   speech, I hearken back to another speech at a public convention I heard 32 years ago. I'm sorry
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:19.040]   to say I'm old enough to actually remember these things. And I remember Pat Buchanan's speech in
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:26.640]   1992. And after Pat described the factory workers who lost their jobs, I just wanted to read you
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:32.800]   what he said. And I want you to think about what JD said. So what Buchanan said was, "My friends,
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:38.320]   these people are our people. They don't read Adam Smith or Edmund Burke, but they come from the same
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:43.200]   schoolyards and the same playgrounds and towns as we come from. They share our beliefs and
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.680]   convictions, our hopes and dreams. They are the conservatives of the heart. They are our people,
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:52.160]   and we need to reconnect with them. We need to let them know we know how bad they're hurting.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.960]   They don't expect miracles of us, but they need to know we care." And I think that for too long,
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:02.560]   Republican leaders ignored that advice. They didn't connect with everyday Americans.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:08.400]   They were foolishly willing to cut programs like Social Security or Medicare, saying that we had to
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:14.720]   cut the deficit while at the same time funding forever wars. So they're totally not credible.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:20.880]   And the party was basically led by warmongers like Dick Cheney or Mitch McConnell or soulless
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:27.840]   bean counters like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. And I think Vance really broke with all of that.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:33.760]   And I think he represents the future of the party. He trashed the Iraq War. He promised no more
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:39.200]   foreign interventions. He railed against policies that benefit multinational corporations at the
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:46.080]   expense of workers. And I think it's no wonder that the neocons lobbied so hard against his
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.120]   selection. But I think... Yeah. Freeberg? Let's get you on that.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.120]   I think those days are over. And I think that, just let me just say at this end with this,
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:58.240]   that I think that Donald Trump and J.D. Vance represent a conservatism of the heart
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.720]   that we haven't seen before. And I think this is the future of the Republican Party.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:07.680]   Freeberg, does J.D. Vance being selected tip your vote towards Trump?
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.800]   Vance. I think he's gonna do well for Trump.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:15.920]   I think if he... Who were his other options?
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:22.960]   Nikki Haley. I mean, there were pressure for him to go after a lot of the neocons, right?
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.960]   Sachs and get the never-Trumper contingent. Wasn't that like a lot of the pressure?
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.320]   Absolutely. I mean, I think there was Doug Burgum,
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.160]   who was... That was your favorite, no, Freeberg?
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:39.840]   Not my favorite. I met him. Seemed like a really thoughtful guy. He's done an incredible job
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:45.920]   managing the state of North Dakota, but he's got some social policy issues that I think are
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:52.480]   gonna rub people the wrong way. And I think to Sachs' point, he's more in the camp of supporting
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:57.920]   Ukraine, which it seems like some part of the party are starting to come around and say no.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:03.120]   So it seems like he wasn't a great fit ultimately. Yeah. By the way, I met Doug Burgum the other
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:08.080]   night and he's a very nice man who I think could play a very important role, very nice guy who I
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.960]   think can play a major, major role in the party. Built an incredible business, sold it to Microsoft.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.880]   Yeah. There's nobody who understands, I think, energy better and all the regulations that have
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.520]   gotten in the way of making America energy independent and tapping our vast energy
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:27.920]   reserves. So I found him very, very impressive on that. But at the end of the day, it's just not
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:34.240]   the kind of pick that J.D. is. I remain a moderate undecided voter. I love J.D. Vance. I think it's
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:39.200]   an inspired choice. I know, Sachs, where you're voting. I'll take some guesses on you Chamath,
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:45.120]   but Freeburg, where are you standing right now? I'm very happy that RFK Jr. was not selected as
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:53.040]   the VP to be on the ticket. I think RFK would have been a challenging partner for Trump and
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:59.280]   it would have led to a lot of disagreements. And I think that RFK has some policy perspectives that
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:07.680]   I don't agree with, particularly as it relates to health, energy, agriculture. And so there are some
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:14.240]   disagreements I have with respect to his view of the world. I will say J.D. seems like a pragmatist.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:20.960]   He seems highly intelligent. He seems highly competent. And I know that he has not been in a
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:27.040]   governing position before. So this is really critical to note. This is a training job for him
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:33.600]   in a large way. He's been a senator and he's been an investor. And he's been an individual contributor
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:40.640]   as an investor. He's built his own firm, but it's not a scaled firm. So this is going to be a really
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:46.560]   interesting kind of process to watch unfold. But I think from a policy and a strategy perspective,
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.600]   he can have a really positive impact on the direction of the things that we talked about
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:56.720]   earlier, which is accountability and government programs, having a clear set of objectives,
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.760]   making sure that we focus on those objectives and don't spend time and resources on things
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:08.640]   that are fluff, and perhaps aren't really meeting the objectives. And I think that he'll have the
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:13.440]   thing I do have concern about, I think that the nationalist agenda, the nationalism and the
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:21.440]   isolationism agenda is counter to global trade, which can be deeply inflationary. And that is one
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:28.560]   concern I do have, which is the ability for the US to export and import with other trade partners
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:33.440]   around the world, I think is critical for us to continue to grow our economy and keep inflation
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:40.240]   down. So if we take policy action, that limits our ability to import because we impose tariffs
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.600]   on other countries, goods and services, it can be inflationary makes things more expensive for
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.080]   Americans, everyday Americans to buy. When everyday Americans go into Walmart,
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:55.040]   and they buy products, a lot of those products are shipped from China. So if there's a tariff
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:57:00.640]   on those products, and the price of those products now goes up by 30 40%. That can be a real burden
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:05.440]   that drives inflation. That's the point about the nationalism on manufacturing and inputs.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.680]   So freeburg, you're pretty convinced at this point that the reciprocal trade agreement
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.720]   would cause inflation, hyperinflation?
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.480]   No, no, I think I think that the idea that the general statement, which I don't think is
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:21.360]   necessarily how this is being executed, I just want to make sure that we're all cognizant of the
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:28.720]   point that if you introduce and if you introduce tariffs on imports, it will drive prices up. Now,
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:33.520]   that may be the right thing to do from a policy perspective, as we heard from, from President
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:39.040]   Trump, when we interviewed him, his belief is that this is an important security state that
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:45.200]   we use it to drive reciprocity, and we use it to hold China in check. And so that may be a more
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:50.160]   important strategic priority over the increase in the price of certain goods. The problem that will
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.600]   arise and this is this happened during the last Trump administration, if China then responds with
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:01.040]   tariffs on the export of US agricultural products, or our biggest buyer of agricultural products
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:07.280]   today is China. And then China put tariffs on our export, or they stopped buying from the US and
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:13.040]   they started buying from Brazil. Instead, the farmers are hurt. And when the farmers are hurt,
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:18.160]   the Trump administration had to spend money to support farmers 10s of billions of dollars.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.200]   Yeah, they subsidized it.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:24.800]   They subsidize they paid farmers in a way. And so the federal government then has to step in
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:30.800]   to meet the gap that arises from what will end up becoming an escalating tariff problem or
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.920]   escalating purchasing problem. So global trade allows the economy to grow gives everyone a
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:40.560]   market, you can start to trade. But there's also the security issues. I do think it's important
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:44.560]   that we onshore a lot of manufacturing, I think it's important, but there's going to be a period
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:49.280]   of pain, there's going to be an investment needed. And it's not going to be simple and easy. And we
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:52.000]   may face quite a bit of inflation on the path to doing that.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.680]   Give us an update here at the end of the show free bird on scholarships and what people have
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.640]   been asking for their own summit.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:03.840]   So this week, we are opening up scholarship applications, you can go to summit.all in
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:10.720]   all in podcast.co. And we have a very, very, very limited number of scholarship tickets that we hold
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:16.080]   for the summit, like we did the last two years, the applications are open now, please get your
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:21.040]   application and right away because we expect that will be completely overbooked almost immediately.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.480]   And some of those scholarships are going to be sponsored by athletic growing companies. So thank
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.160]   you to athletic growing company for paying for a lot of our scholarship recipients to go to the
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:32.400]   online summit this year, really exciting programming coming together, we have more details to share in
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:38.240]   the next couple weeks. And we do, we do have one more last block of ga tickets that we're going to
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:45.360]   release, get your application in on the website, summit.all in podcast.co for a ga ticket for the
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.480]   last block. Thank you.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.000]   All right, let's just do one quick business story here. Since we spent the bulk of the episode
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:57.600]   talking about politics and current events, exits creeping back, Sequoia is doing a secondary sale
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.200]   of their Stripe investment, one of the greatest investments of the last decade. And Google is
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:12.240]   in talks to acquire Wiz. And this is absolutely amazing news for the industry, which has been
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.120]   suffering from a lack of distributions. As you can see in this chart, Chamath after 2021,
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:25.600]   exit values just plummeted. And there are some signs of life now. Let's start with Sequoia
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:31.360]   buying back some Stripe shares from its own LPs. Sequoia Capital has invested 517 million in Stripe.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:38.240]   That's currently worth about 10 billion. 20X, Michael Moritz, led the seed in Series A.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:45.120]   Sequoia offered to buy back 860 million in Stripe shares from LPs and its legacy funds. Those are
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:51.280]   the funds between 2009 and 2012. Sequoia is using capital from their newer funds,
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.760]   like its Evergreen Fund that was formed in 2021, the Heritage Fund, that's their wealth management
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:02.400]   team, to give the legacy funds some liquidity. It's not normal that a company stay private this
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.680]   long. It is the exception to the rule, but it has happened. It actually happened with Uber to a
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:15.600]   certain extent. So legacy fund LPs have the choice to hold, sell some, or sell all of their Stripe
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.320]   shares. Here's the quote from the note. "Sequoia personnel and associated persons will not be
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.920]   offered the option to sell Stripe shares previously received as carried interest distributions from
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:28.960]   the legacy funds." And they are offering $2,750 a share, which is pretty generous, $70 billion
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:38.320]   valuation. As you may know, Stripe has hit as high as $100 billion in market cap in the private
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:46.560]   markets. So this will be from the seed, which was a 20 million post, 3,500X for those LPs.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:54.400]   And for the Series A, it is a $100 million post, which is 700X for those people who don't know.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.320]   I think it was Sam Altman who actually did that investment as a Sequoia scout in the same fund
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.280]   that I did the Uber investment. So still the number one and two investments there.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:10.080]   Your thoughts, Jamal, on this unique opportunity and device to sell early shares from the same
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:14.960]   venture fund? I have two thoughts. The first is that it's interesting to see that they
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.160]   mark the valuation up to $70 billion. So that's a good sign for Stripe.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.040]   But the second thing is, I was a little kind of puzzled by this whole thing.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:34.400]   It's a very complicated thing when you're buying old stakes into a new fund and crossing funds.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.000]   It's sort of like actually one of those things that are supposed to be verboten.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.840]   And when you're trying to build a good fund with great governance,
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.560]   this is actually at the top of the list of the things that you're never supposed to do.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:53.840]   Which is to provide liquidity to a group of LPs via another fund that you control.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.040]   But I think this actually shows what may be going on behind the scenes. So I don't want to be
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:06.800]   conspiratorial or anything, but it would be a great way for the GPs to get liquid to meet their
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.160]   capital calls here without having to pay capital gains tax. And that makes a lot of sense for the
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:17.760]   GPs themselves. And so I suspect that that probably... Well, they did say that the GPs
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.320]   aren't going to get to liquidate anything. So they did put that note in there. So they've
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.040]   anticipated that. Right, so you can provide... No, but what that means is you can provide liquidity,
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.400]   you don't get to pull the money out, that's fine. But then now you can use it to fund capital calls.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.760]   But I don't like it. I don't like these kinds of things where one fund is basically scratching
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:41.440]   the back of another fund. It always tends to be the case that this stuff on the surface
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:47.600]   looks a little smelly, and can be a little unseemly. And this is why you're not supposed
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:53.120]   to do it. You're supposed to go and get some other random fund to buy these things. And I think it's
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.520]   generally a much cleaner thing to do. And the hygiene of it is clearly what we see SACs in
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.480]   that documentation, giving people choices, you can make your own choice. We're not taking carry,
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.840]   we're not selling our shares, and we're only selling 10%. So they did go to extreme measures,
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.680]   I guess, to outline that. But your thoughts on this type of sale? It happens in private equity
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.360]   all the time, I understand. But we don't see an adventure all that often. What are your thoughts
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.240]   on this providing liquidity to the 14-year-old funds? Well, first of all, there's a Kid Rock
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.280]   concert going on behind me. Sorry if that's distracting for you. No, no, it's going to be
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.760]   lit. That's all I can say. If he's introducing President Trump, it's going to be pretty baller
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:38.560]   tonight. We're taping on Thursday, obviously. This episode will probably come out tomorrow.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.560]   But in any event, with respect to the Sequoia thing, look, I think there's this overarching
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:52.400]   issue of the fact that VC funds are classically designed to be 10-year funds. The money is called
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.680]   over time, usually over the first few years, it's invested, and then you don't get liquidity. I mean,
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.080]   it's not like a mutual fund where you can take your money out. You get liquidity if and when
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:07.520]   the fund gets liquidity. And these funds are meant to be long-term illiquid vehicles. So like I said,
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.760]   10 years. And typically, you can get two one-year extensions to the funds.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.640]   So then the question is, what do you do at year 12 if you still got positions in those funds?
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.880]   Well, I think a pretty good solution is what I think Sequoia is doing here and what I've heard
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:26.560]   other people do, which is if you have a security that's not public yet but is semi-liquid because
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:33.520]   it's a very late-stage private company, then what you can do is spin those shares into an SPV or to
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:40.960]   some other vehicle. And you let new investors come in and buy those shares at some price,
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.760]   and then you give the option to your old investors, "Do you want to sell or do you
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.480]   want to roll into the new vehicle?" So nobody is forced to give up their ownership position,
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:55.440]   but if they want to get liquidity and there's sufficient demand on the buy side that you can
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:59.760]   get them that liquidity, it's a really elegant solution. I can't say I know exactly all the
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:03.600]   details of what Sequoia is doing because they've got this two-tier fund structure that makes it a
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:09.120]   little different. But I have seen in other cases, people have distributed shares into an SPV,
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:14.800]   and then new buyers come in, participate, and then the old investors get to decide
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:20.960]   whether they roll or sell. So it's a pretty good way of handling this 12-year limit.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.440]   Just to... Sorry, I didn't clarify this. Valuation is based on the last 409A, so...
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.000]   That's the one thing about Sequoia that's a little different is, remember,
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.280]   it's their global mega fund that's buying the shares as opposed to an SPV. Normally,
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:38.240]   what would happen in terms of figuring out the price is you'd want to use some sort of
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.720]   validated secondary price, but obviously, it'd have to be a market-clearing price
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:48.160]   where new money wants to come in at that price. And this is a little bit different because it's
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:55.360]   their pre-existing fund that's buying at that price. And so how do you sanity check the valuation?
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:02.960]   And I guess I would just want to make sure that that valuation is a secondary... Yeah,
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.280]   it's like the secondary clearing price. That's what it's trading at in secondary
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.960]   markets, and that's what the 409A is. So I guess that would be the hygiene there,
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.800]   but it's certainly unique, and I guess great for those LPs.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:19.360]   That's a word for us. Well, I mean, we had a similar thing happen with Uber where they did
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:26.560]   the secondary and they had Masayoshi-san come in and do an IPO, essentially.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.760]   That's entirely different.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:34.080]   Yeah, you had new money coming in, to your point. So here is the second story related to DPI
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:39.360]   and VCs getting cash out. Google's an advanced stocks acquirer whiz for $23 billion, according
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.600]   to the Wall Street Journal. It's an Israeli-American cybersecurity startup that was founded only in
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:49.200]   2020. Backed by Sequoia Index, Insight, and Treason and others. One of the fastest growing
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:56.800]   startups ever, reaching 500 million in ARR in 4.5 years. Google would be paying 46x forward revenue.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:06.160]   They think they'll have a billion in ARR sometime next year. And what are our thoughts on this in
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.440]   terms of M&A?
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:15.680]   You saw it on this AT&T hack of Snowflake. But cloud security is a really big deal. The more
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.440]   cloud services you have, the more difficult it is to lock these things down. And so whether it's
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:27.840]   Google or Amazon or Azure, they each have a really big problem on their hands, which is that if all
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.600]   these customers are convinced to move these workloads into the cloud, but then you can't
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:37.920]   secure it, and you get hacked, that ends the business. So whiz is an incredible testament to,
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.680]   I guess, engineering prowess. I don't exactly know, to be honest with you, the quality of the
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.920]   product. Obviously, I don't interact with those kinds of products every day. But the fact that
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.640]   they're willing to pay such a premium means A, the product is good, but more importantly, B,
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:58.800]   in the absence of cloud security, these cloud vendors are going to be constrained in how fast
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:04.320]   they can grow. So what an incredible market. What an incredible, incredible market.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:10.560]   I have to say these two things have really helped the climate in the LP community. This past week,
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:17.760]   a lot of chatter about IPOs that are getting filed and that we could be ending the drought
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:24.480]   and people were feeling very, very pessimistic about venture as a category. And I think these
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:32.480]   two things have changed a lot of people's feelings on that. So good work there. And I think it also
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:39.440]   signals maybe some regime change expectations, Sax. Yeah, Lena Kahn, maybe getting booted when
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:46.000]   this regime change occurs next year, and then maybe more M&A would occur. What's Trump's and
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.920]   J.D. Vance's position, in your mind, on M&A and Lena Kahn, Sax, if you had to interpret it?
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.960]   Well, something that's very interesting is that J.D. Vance has been relatively positive
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:06.240]   towards Lena Kahn. He's one of Lena Kahn's few Republican fans. And the reason for that is
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:10.240]   because Lena Kahn, for all of her faults, and we've described them here, has been willing to
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:15.840]   take on big tech. The fact of the matter is that the top handful of tech companies, the Microsofts,
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:22.480]   the Googles, Amazon, these are big tech monopolies. There's just no way around that fact. And they do
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:28.800]   need to be closely watched and supervised and regulated with respect to their market power.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.240]   And I do think they use their market power in inappropriate ways, as we've discussed on this
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.920]   podcast. I sometimes think that Lena Kahn, in her approach, has been a little bit more of a cleaver
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.760]   when she needed to use a scalpel. I don't think that she should stop some of these, what I would
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:48.880]   call R&D acquisitions, from taking place, where there's no accretion of market share, but rather
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.880]   starts being bought because they contribute a useful piece of technology. I don't think you
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.520]   want to shut down that part of the market. Lord knows we don't have enough exits as it is, like
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:03.440]   we were just talking about. So I think it would be great if we can kind of massage Lena Kahn's
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.240]   approach a little bit. But I think that it is a good thing that she's not willing to just roll
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:12.480]   over and let the big tech companies do whatever they want. And I think JD Vance appreciates that
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:19.520]   about her. So look, I don't think that Lena Kahn is going to be running that agency in a second
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:23.360]   Trump administration, but I think there's going to be a... How much of the problem with Republicans,
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:30.720]   though, Saks, is the freedom of speech issue and Republicans being banned on the social platforms?
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.040]   Absolutely. Including it up to Trump. I mean, if that issue wasn't there, I think you would
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.680]   probably see maybe a different approach, yeah? Well, I think it's a huge issue because the fact
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:44.240]   of the matter is you've got these tech monopolies who are using their monopolistic market power
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.480]   to put their thumb on the scale of our political discourse in favor of one side versus the other.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.880]   So obviously if you're on that side of the aisle, you're going to be up in arms about that. You're
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:59.600]   not going to be happy about that. And I do think that given their market power, they have an
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:06.000]   obligation not to distort our democracy by artificially suppressing one side of the debate.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:12.000]   So I think that, yes, Republicans should be up in arms about that and they should be resisting
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.120]   censorship. And J.D. Vance specifically mentioned censorship in his speech.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:23.040]   That seems to be his main issue. I think we'll see under Trump a lot more mid-market M&A. If I were
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:29.040]   to, let's call it under $100 billion, $100 billion acquisition would be fine with me, under $100.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:33.040]   Well, I really liked the part of his speech where he said that in a healthy democracy,
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.480]   we debate ideas and that's good. We even have debates in the Republican party and that's good.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:41.440]   The last thing we want to do is censor the marketplace of ideas. Gosh, I mean, are we
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.000]   going to hear anything like that from the Democrats when they do their convention?
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.520]   Well, in breaking news, as we wrap up this program, the hot swap summer will continue. Apparently,
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:55.200]   Biden is predicted to resign this weekend. We'll see if it happens. Speedrun primary,
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.240]   Nostradamus is predicting it happens.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:58.960]   Nostracanus.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.400]   I'm going to stick with my, Nostracanus, sorry.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.320]   Nostracanus, get it straight.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.920]   Nostracanus will keep his position. The hot swap is coming.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:12.080]   Well, Jake, at this point, I think you were right about Biden stepping aside. I thought he was out
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:17.120]   of the woods. He did that press conference, that NATO press conference, where he did make that one
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.360]   mistake, that senior moment where he actually-
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.480]   That Trump was his VP?
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:20.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.160]   Oops.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.600]   But that was the kind of thing where he got his name mixed up. But otherwise,
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.880]   he sort of seems to be finding his footing in terms of talking about policy. And the brush fire
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:38.320]   was sort of put out, right? But then for some unknown reason, he goes on and does that Lester
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.680]   Holt interview. I don't know why they were still letting him do interviews. He should only be
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.880]   reading from a teleprompter. And he mixes up, he forgets the name of his Secretary of Defense,
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.920]   Lloyd Austin, and he just refers to him as the black man.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.520]   The BET, yeah.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.040]   As a BET interview. So he did the Lester Holt interview, which was not good. And then he did
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.160]   the BET interview, which was a disaster.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.920]   Well, the money dried up, right, Chamath? So once the money goes, it's over.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:06.000]   Well, yeah. And he also did a horrible one with 360 with Speedy, Speedy Mormon. And that was
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.880]   a train wreck. There was a couple moments there that are just total gaffes.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:16.160]   They say Pelosi and Schumer told him it's over. And I guess that means... And Katzenberg.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.640]   You're right, Jason. When the big money is gone and they make the call,
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.600]   it's done.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.160]   It's done.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:27.120]   Isn't that amazing what we've learned about the Democratic Party? The coup
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.800]   de grace was basically Katzenberg going in there saying, "Yeah, I can't raise any money for you."
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.960]   And then boom, he's out.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.080]   I am shocked that any political party would be swayed in any way by political donations.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.320]   Enjoy the RNC, Sax.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.960]   I love you guys. I got to go to dinner.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.080]   Love you guys. Talk to you soon.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:49.920]   For the Chairman Dictator, the Architect David Sax, and your Sultan of Science who
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.560]   ducked out a little bit early, I am the world's greatest moderator.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.760]   We'll see you next time. Bye-bye.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.400]   Love you guys. Bye-bye.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.000]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.880]   Rain Man David Sax.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:10.000]   And instead, we open-sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:10.560]   Love you, Wesley.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.040]   Ice Queen of Quinoa.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.040]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.040]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.800]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.840]   Besties are gone.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.000]   That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway, Sax.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.280]   Oh, man.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.200]   My avatar will meet me at Plains.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.120]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.000]   It's like this sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.120]   What are the beat?
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.720]   What are the beat?
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.360]   We need to get merch.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.120]   Besties are gone.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:55.360]   [music]
