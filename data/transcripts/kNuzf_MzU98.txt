[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:10.220]   So I am thrilled to introduce my colleague
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.220]   who in turn will introduce our panel of Vanguard experts.
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.560]   Susan Jubinski is here from Morningstar.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.480]   Like Jeff, she's a Morningstar veteran.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.080]   She is even longer tenured than me at Morningstar,
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.660]   which is really saying something.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.180]   She's been at Morningstar for 30 years.
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.560]   She has had many, many different roles,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.720]   managed a big team of people at various points in time,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.140]   raised her triplets who just started college this year.
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.400]   And... (audience applauding)
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.940]   Well, it's a big, big deal.
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.960]   But I sometimes call Susan Morningstar's secret weapon,
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.000]   but the good news is she's not really
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.380]   a secret weapon anymore.
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.860]   I think many of you know her in her role
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.580]   as Director of Content.
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.040]   She is all over Morningstar.com.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.040]   She is writing really helpful articles, interviewing people.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.740]   She is just a tremendous resource for me,
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.860]   and I know for all of you who use Morningstar.com
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.180]   and are looking for good investment information,
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.780]   Susan is a go-to person.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.260]   So I'm so happy that she agreed to be here
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.540]   to be one of our moderators.
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780]   She's one of the best moderators we have,
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.260]   and she is going to introduce our Vanguard panel.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.160]   Thank you, Susan.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.940]   - Well, thank you, Christine.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.820]   One of my favorite things I do in my job
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.140]   is interviewing Christine.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.980]   So it's great to be here,
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.660]   and it's so wonderful to meet so many of you.
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.640]   As Christine mentions, I've been around a little while,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.340]   and I was at Morningstar when the Bogleheads board
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.860]   started on what I believe might have still been
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.900]   Morningstar.net.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.580]   I'm not sure if we were .com even yet.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.380]   So it's great to meet all of you.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.100]   I'm very happy to be here,
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.260]   and especially this year.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.620]   We're having quite a year, aren't we?
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.800]   That 60/40 portfolio is really working out
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.100]   for everybody this year.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.540]   And I think it's at times like this,
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.180]   even though we're all long-term investors,
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.980]   you start to wonder, hmm,
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.700]   how am I defining investment success in a market like this?
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.460]   And how am I really doing,
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.900]   and how should I be thinking about my financial situation
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.300]   when we're entering a period of rising interest rates,
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.940]   which we haven't seen in a while?
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.300]   We're dealing with some pretty hot inflation,
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.660]   which we also haven't seen for a while.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.460]   And boy, those interest rates and bond market, whoo.
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.460]   So I think it's a very interesting time,
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.380]   even for long-term investors.
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.820]   So it's great to sort of have Vanguard in the house
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.140]   to talk with us a little bit
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.100]   about how they're sort of thinking about
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.300]   as an organization, investment success,
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.160]   and maybe what we can sort of learn from that
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.420]   and take away from that.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.740]   Not just in a market like this,
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.460]   but when things just get so much better
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.800]   in the market, we hope, soon.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.440]   So they're here with us today
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.180]   to share some research that they've been doing
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.180]   on sort of personalization and advice
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.940]   and how to be thinking about financial advice.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.540]   And then they're gonna do a presentation,
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.380]   and then we're gonna pivot over into the Q&A session
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.060]   for about 20 minutes.
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.760]   I have a couple of questions related to the market
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.820]   that I wanna sort of ask.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.300]   But then we're gonna turn things over to you
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.300]   to ask your questions about the market,
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.540]   their research, Vanguard.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.620]   After all, we have Vanguard in the house,
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.900]   so let's take advantage.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.940]   So let me introduce, of course, Joel Dixon,
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.180]   who is currently Vanguard's Global Head
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.780]   of Advice Methodology,
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.980]   and Paula Costa, who is a Behavioral Economist at Vanguard.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.500]   And they're both coming to us
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.260]   from Vanguard's Texas office.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.100]   Who would have thought, Texas, Vanguard.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.420]   Anyway, thank you both for being here.
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.980]   It's great to see you, Ann.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.380]   - Well, thank you. - Check us out.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.340]   - Great being here.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.840]   Quickly, how many of you first-time Bogleheads Conference?
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.300]   - Whoa.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.480]   - Uh-oh.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.880]   Haven't seen my shtick.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.780]   Okay.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.620]   No, that's great.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.860]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.100]   This is actually also Paulo's first Bogleheads Conference.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.260]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.680]   Please be nice to him.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.940]   You can take other things out on me,
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.740]   but please be nice to Paulo.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.260]   What we did wanna do today is just give a little bit
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.380]   of kind of what's happening behind the scenes
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.540]   from an investment standpoint and how we think about,
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.020]   you know, when we talk about Vanguard's core purpose,
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.900]   you know, taking a stand for all investors,
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.020]   treating 'em fairly, giving the best chance
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.460]   for investment success, what does that mean?
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.780]   How is that evolving?
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.540]   What are we thinking about in the,
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.100]   whether it's the current environment,
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.900]   whether it is just the situation of what it means
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.340]   to have investment success?
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.620]   And, you know, a lot of things, you know,
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.340]   you folks do it really well with helping each other out
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.220]   on the boards or, you know, the discussion that was,
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.060]   that Nick just had on a number of different topics
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.060]   and so forth about, you know, what really matters
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.620]   is what matters to you.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.980]   And yet the investment industry, when we talk about advice,
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.860]   when we talk about value from certain things,
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.900]   it ends up being these rules of thumb,
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.460]   these generic descriptions, oh, save 12 to 15% a year.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.460]   You know, 4% withdrawal rule in retirement.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.540]   You're gonna live for 30 years in retirement.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.540]   All of these things actually lead to recommendations
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.140]   that are at best on average, if this will happen,
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.900]   and actually at worst may not actually figure out
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.620]   the sort of trade-offs that actually exist
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.700]   in a full kind of thinking about a plan.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.740]   And so one of the things that we've been doing
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.580]   a lot of lately is how do we talk about
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.420]   and think about personalization?
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.740]   That's why this so hopefully catchy title
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.460]   about putting the you in value.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.700]   Because what matters and what's valuable
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.500]   is dependent on everyone's individual assumptions,
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.340]   situation, perspective, goals, and so forth.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.340]   And then related to that is how it all integrates together.
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.900]   And so that's what we were gonna talk about.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.700]   And I kind of just wanted to quickly talk about,
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.580]   you know, when the kind of high-level principles of success
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.420]   that we often talk about, goals, balance, cost, discipline.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.740]   Okay, all motherhood apple pie type stuff.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.620]   But I think what's important to recognize here
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.540]   is really only one of these four categories,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.100]   the balance one, specifically talks about asset allocation.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.300]   You know, that the other things that are so important
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.940]   are things like what are your goals?
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.780]   How are they different?
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.660]   How do they evolve over time?
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.500]   How much are you spending or saving?
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.100]   And is that consistent with what you want
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.020]   for your lifestyle and approach?
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.540]   Cost, well, not just investment costs,
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.140]   but taxes and so forth.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.660]   Often, I mean, other than say the Boglehead Group,
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.060]   not often talked about enough.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.780]   You know, Eric Balchunas last night did a great job
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.820]   in sort of saying, hey, look, here's the, you know,
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.660]   the power of the structure, the mutual ownership structure
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.180]   and the cost piece of it.
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.220]   I would just add the other power is the alignment
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.340]   with the end investors about the focus
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.260]   being there without the same conflicts of interest
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.220]   that often exist.
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.780]   And then discipline is just sticking to that plan.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.340]   Well, how do you value all these things?
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.980]   A lot of what we talk about in providing value
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.460]   or security or so forth tends to be related
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.260]   to investment balances.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.020]   Well, if you do this today,
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.660]   you will have $100,000 25 years from now.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.340]   You know, your asset allocation
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.780]   or maybe even your saving rate,
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.500]   but it doesn't integrate it all together
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.740]   and think about the trade-offs
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.500]   and then your personal situation
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.700]   and what kind of recommendations would be right for you.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.620]   So there are a couple of,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.780]   there are two different sort of things
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.980]   that we just wanna talk about before we get to the Q&A.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.580]   And you're gonna be seeing a lot more of this from Vanguard
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.380]   in terms of the future and discussions
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.660]   of what does it mean to be successful and so forth.
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.380]   One is focused a lot more on the accumulator area,
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.980]   but this whole concept of financial wellness,
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.980]   which is a big issue for especially younger investors,
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.620]   but not exclusively younger investors.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.220]   But now thinking about like
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.140]   the total balance sheet considerations of clients,
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.700]   debt versus assets versus how do you save?
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.060]   How do you create the ability to save longer term?
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.340]   And then the second we'll talk about
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.140]   is a little bit of integration
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.220]   in a quantitative way actually
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.060]   of financial planning concepts and investment concepts
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.540]   to put them on the same playing field.
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.820]   And we'll do that with a case study.
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.060]   And I just wanna let you know,
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.060]   I'm gonna be asking for your participation in this.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.820]   I'm gonna want you to be bogey heads,
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.060]   you know, helping out somebody that might be posting.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.660]   And so we'll see on that
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.020]   and then talk about what kind of the trade-offs there
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.860]   that might be there.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.460]   And this concept of personalization and integration
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.100]   is what you're gonna see more and more of
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.940]   from Vanguard going forward.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.380]   I will say there are two kind of research papers
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.220]   behind these two topics.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.300]   I am a co-author on none of them.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.900]   So I am the stuffed suit.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.140]   Paulo is a co-author on both of them.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.500]   So, but I just wanted to sort of set that up
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.740]   and he'll talk about financial wellness.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.260]   I'll come back and talk a little bit more
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.140]   about the value in personalization.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:29.980]   All right.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.860]   - Thank you, Joel.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.860]   So, this is a preview of our new paper,
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.380]   the Vanguard's Guide to Financial Wellness.
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.660]   It's not out yet.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.260]   So this is a preview for a special audience.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.900]   But the idea of this paper is what,
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.420]   given your personal situation,
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.220]   what are the next best actions that you should take
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.820]   to achieve your financial goals?
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.420]   So the idea here, yesterday during dinner,
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.700]   Eric Baltunis showed that graph
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.060]   that the bottom 50% in wealth of the population
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.940]   only have 1% of stock market wealth.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.940]   And that's a pretty striking number.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.860]   So let's look at the financial health
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.540]   of the American household.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.540]   So first of all, 40% of families do not save money.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.660]   That's a pretty sobering number.
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:36.660]   36% of households cannot cover an emergency of $400.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:43.580]   And 45% of these families carry credit card debt.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.700]   And the average credit card debt is actually over $6,000.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.500]   And this is the debt that is over,
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.820]   in terms of interest, 20% a year.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.620]   So you put all these facts together.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.300]   It's like, in our mission,
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.540]   we want to give investors
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.580]   the best chance for investment success.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.060]   How can one have the best chance
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.620]   for investment success with this?
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.060]   So how can we help them?
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.460]   So that's the genesis of this paper,
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.100]   is to try to give everyone
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.220]   the best chance for investment success.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.380]   So just, financial wellness is a topic
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.700]   that people talk a lot about.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.380]   I just wanna be precise in the way that we define it.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.780]   So here we say, is the objective financial situation
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.940]   of a person, of a household,
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.660]   is the ability to meet current
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.580]   and near-term financial obligation,
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.060]   and be on track to meet future goals.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.700]   And we divide it in three steps.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.500]   And the idea here is,
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.900]   step one is take control of your finances.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.140]   We hear people saying a lot, money controls me.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.500]   And how do we fight that back?
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.500]   So the first idea, well, how do you take control back
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.500]   from your finances?
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.900]   So, and then the second one, once you have that saddle,
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.380]   how do you prepare for emergencies?
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.100]   And later on, when you have that saddle,
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.500]   making progress towards your goals.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.860]   So, take control of your finances.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.220]   And I'm gonna start with a very controversial topic.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.700]   Create a budget that works for you.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.140]   Some people love budgeting,
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.380]   and some people hate budgeting.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.100]   And the point here is, actually,
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.700]   I think that most people actually hate
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.500]   tracking their expenses,
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.420]   because that can get pretty boring pretty quickly.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.940]   But the, actually, in the paper,
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.340]   we create two, like a short questionnaire,
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.180]   like two questions, just for people to find out
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.340]   what's the budgeting style they prefer best.
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.740]   But the idea here, basically,
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.460]   if you know how much money's coming in
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.140]   and where your money's going,
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.220]   that's just a really simple, powerful step.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.980]   And here, just be mindful, these steps are not in order.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.580]   You know, any step, any positive step that you take,
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.460]   you know, will contribute to your financial goals.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.500]   The second one is pay at least a minimum on all your debt.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.540]   And the reason is, basically,
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.460]   you don't want to go into default,
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.300]   because that's gonna take a hit in your credit score,
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.020]   your debt will become more expensive,
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.540]   and in the future, you may not even be able to access that.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.820]   So, make sure you pay all of that.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.820]   So, make, maximize the employer match.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:25.060]   So, the idea there is, I just found this statistic
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.740]   that, for me, was surprising.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.260]   31% of people that have access to a 401(k) with a match
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.660]   actually do not contribute up to the match.
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.580]   And that's, you know, tens of billions of dollars
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.740]   that are left on the table every year.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.020]   So, that's something very straightforward
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.940]   that, you know, can improve chances of investment success.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.060]   And then, I would be remiss if I didn't say
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.740]   pay down high-interest debt.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.420]   And the point here, one thing that I had forgotten,
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.780]   having lived in Massachusetts for a long time,
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.540]   when we moved down to Texas,
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.700]   what we saw is, you know,
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.620]   the payday loan shops are everywhere.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.900]   And those shops, you know, on a good day,
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.140]   you come out with a loan of an annualized rate of 300%.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.540]   On a bad day, 1,000%.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.180]   So, it's just absolutely absurd.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.660]   It's really expensive.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.780]   And also, credit card debt
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.620]   that doesn't have such a high interest rate,
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.060]   but compared to payday loans,
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.860]   we're still between 15% and 20%,
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.420]   but sometimes even higher,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.940]   depending on your situation, your credit score.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.060]   So, this is what we call taking control of your finances.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.260]   So, this lays the groundwork.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.020]   But then, once you start to accumulate assets now,
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.420]   we think of preparing for the unexpected.
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.820]   And then, obviously, we're talking about emergency savings.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.020]   And at Vanguard, we actually think
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.580]   about emergency savings in two steps.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.900]   So, first, set up emergency savings
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.900]   for unexpected expenses.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.540]   So, we're talking about those, you know,
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.620]   you get a flat tire or, you know, your heat stop working.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.300]   So, we're talking about those expenses
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.780]   that you should keep around $2,000
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.580]   or half of your monthly expense,
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.860]   and usually in a checking on a high-yield savings account.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.260]   Then, building up a reserve of three to six months
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260]   and that, you know, for potential job loss.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.180]   And the idea there is that because job loss
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.220]   is something that doesn't happen as frequently,
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.140]   you can keep that in an accessible investment account.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.180]   For example, you can put that in a taxable brokerage account.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.740]   You can even put some of that in a Roth IRA
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.020]   because their contributions can be withdrawn tax-free.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.860]   So, I still remember not very long ago
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.260]   when I first had my emergency savings all filled up.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.500]   And I remember just looking at that amount on my screen
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.740]   and then, you know, being stressful
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.220]   because of, you know, financial things.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.900]   But just looking at that number and just staring at it,
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.340]   the amount of peace of mind that that brought to me.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.220]   And it's just, I think, one thing in personal finance
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.060]   that we don't talk as much about,
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.180]   and it's extremely important,
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.300]   is, you know, how powerful cash can be.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.660]   You know, we talk about asset allocation.
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.940]   We talk about stocks and bonds.
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.620]   But, you know, cash, you know,
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.300]   it also brings a lot of peace of mind to folks.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.060]   And we don't -- we shouldn't forget about that.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.780]   For, you know, for the everyday investor,
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.660]   that's extremely important.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.380]   And then, evaluate your insurance needs.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.500]   And here, obviously, health insurance.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.420]   But for younger folks, disability insurance.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.580]   Because a lot of your capital is actually in your human capital.
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.660]   It's in the salary that you're going to earn
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.100]   for the rest of your life.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.980]   So, that shouldn't be forgotten.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.460]   And then, get your legal documents
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.380]   in order to ensure that your wishes are realized.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.940]   Here, we are talking about wills.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.020]   We are talking about power of attorney.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.180]   We -- so, these are conversations
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.300]   that are really tough to have.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.460]   But it's best to have them while you're here.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.540]   Imagine how tough it could be for your loved ones
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.020]   if you're not here to have those conversations.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.300]   And also, guardianships for people who have kids and pets.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:21.020]   So, those are things that they may not necessarily have,
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.340]   you know, a dollar sign next to it.
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.420]   But they're extremely important as well.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.740]   And then, once you have prepared for the unexpected,
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.420]   now making progress towards goals.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.940]   So, now, you know, the bread and butter.
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.820]   Increase savings and make the most
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.420]   of your tax advantage accounts.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.860]   So, in step one, you already maximize your employer match.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.540]   Now, you know, retirement.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.820]   If you have access to a Roth IRA, contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.300]   We saw last time Nick doesn't like
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.620]   when you maximize your 401(k), you know.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.180]   But if you want to maximize your 401(k), you're fine.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.740]   You can do it.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:03.460]   So, if you want to use your HSAs for retirement savings,
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.340]   you know, the triple tax advantage can go a long way.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.820]   Obviously, HSAs for health, 529 for education.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.660]   And then, you get to flex with taxable accounts.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.660]   And I think that was Nick's point.
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.260]   Taxable accounts, you know, taxable brokerage accounts,
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.580]   they give you the flexibility.
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.260]   If you want to save for a house, if you want to save for vacation,
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.180]   if you want to do early retirement, not that I'm talking
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.220]   about thinking about early retirement, Joe.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.660]   >> I'm thinking about my early retirement.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.980]   >> But then, also, this is a time to consider paying
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.460]   down low interest debt.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.100]   For example, if you were one of the lucky ones
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.580]   that got a mortgage, you know, under 4%,
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.420]   there used to be something realistic, you know,
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.660]   12 months ago, but not anymore.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:55.020]   Car loans, student loans, and also, one of my favorite parts
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.020]   of this paper is set a strategy for your charitable giving.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.260]   You know, I think there is much good to do in this world.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.980]   And if we have an opportunity to do it, why not?
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:12.620]   And then, the benefits of all of this.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.820]   Obviously, we talked about, we talk a lot about dollar signs.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.660]   But here, this statistic shocked me.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.580]   Sixty-five percent of Americans say money is a significant
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.460]   source of stress.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.420]   And if you look at folks under age of 40,
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.580]   that number is way up 80%.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.740]   The economy is taking 88%.
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.220]   So, people are extremely stressed about money.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.300]   So, where can financial wellness, like,
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.740]   help here and alleviate some of these issues?
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.540]   So, a lot of research showing that it alleviates, you know,
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.300]   mental health concerns.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.700]   It improves sleep.
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.620]   Relationships at home.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:57.100]   I mean, how many marriages end because of financial concerns?
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.780]   Self-esteem, productivity, attendance at work.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.220]   So, these are things that, you know, we talk so much
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.300]   about finance, and we, you know, such a, in that way,
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.300]   a privileged situation in which, you know, we have friends
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.580]   and colleagues that know so much about this.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.300]   But there are a lot of people out there
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:19.020]   who don't have this source of knowledge and information
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.020]   and willingness, you know, to help each other.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:26.340]   So, you start seeing this more and more from Vanguard.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:32.860]   For example, this is a new tab in our 401(k) page.
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.740]   If you see in the middle, welcome back, Paulo.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.140]   This may or may not be a screenshot of my own 401(k) page,
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.140]   but you will see more and more of this.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.380]   It's already live, and it's based
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.380]   on the findings of the paper.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.180]   But, you know, just guidance,
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.820]   financial wellness may not be enough for some people,
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.500]   and that's where advice can come in.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.580]   So, I'll hand it back to Joel to talk about the value
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.980]   of personalized advice.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:02.820]   >> Thanks, Paulo.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.620]   I actually just wanted to kind of build
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.740]   on a couple of things there.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.340]   When we talk about the benefits of investing,
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.100]   or in the case of financial wellness,
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.620]   what do you think defines success?
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.900]   I'd be just interested in some thoughts.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.700]   What is success?
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.580]   I'm sorry, having enough?
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.980]   Okay.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.660]   Being happy.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.300]   Okay. And that's where I want to go.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:40.060]   The emotional piece, the outcomes of peace of mind
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.020]   or happy or feeling secure or so forth.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.260]   And, you know, the messages that we've had,
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.260]   and I would even say vanguard over the years, hey,
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.580]   save for the long term, save for retirement,
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.860]   save for retirement, save for retirement.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.900]   Yeah, absolutely, you should be doing
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.940]   that as a 25-year-old, 30, 35-year-old.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.300]   But it also doesn't resonate if they're worried about, shoot,
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.500]   I've got this credit card debt that is just sitting on top
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.620]   of me that's not allowing me to do anything.
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.540]   I have different goals and different sort
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.980]   of emotional reactions with money
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.540]   over the course of my lifetime.
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.820]   And that's why thinking
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.820]   of a more holistic total view is coming out of this.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:27.300]   So this part is that we're going to talk about is how do you think
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.140]   about putting all of this together and kind
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.260]   of making tradeoffs and taking an integrated personalized look?
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.140]   And by the way, this could be called the value
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.180]   of personalized advice, which it is in the white paper
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:43.220]   that we just released on this within the last month or so.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.220]   But it could also just be called the value
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.620]   of personalized recommendations.
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.500]   It's not advice per se, but about how do we surface
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.620]   for each individual situation the best options
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:02.180]   that can generate success and therefore hopefully peace
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.860]   of mind or more confidence in the approach.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.940]   So let me talk a little bit about that, which is when we think
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.140]   about personalization, it's elements
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.780]   that go beyond investment performance.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.420]   So much of what we talk about is investment performance.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.500]   And I'll be a little bit provocative.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.820]   I'm sure get to this in the Q and A. You know what?
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.020]   It is really, really fun to talk about investment things.
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.660]   What's the market going to do?
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.580]   Should I be in the three-fund portfolio,
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.620]   the permanent portfolio, market cap portfolio?
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.620]   Those are a lot of fun discussions.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:44.060]   At the end of the day, if you don't have how much is being
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.260]   saved or what your kind of standard
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.380]   of living expectation might be or so forth, honestly,
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.260]   all those things are kind of just at the margin.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.180]   They don't really matter that much.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.340]   Yeah, you can be successful with a three-fund portfolio.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.860]   You can be successful with a market cap portfolio and so forth.
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.180]   But a lot of these things that we end up talking
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.860]   about that are much harder to quantify
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.220]   can make as much or more of a difference
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.340]   in terms of outcomes and success.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.500]   So integrating those kind of concepts of financial planning,
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.580]   whether it be savings strategies, drawdowns,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:22.500]   approaches, tax pieces into that,
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.620]   but at your situation and for your perspective.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.180]   And then looking at the forward and going back
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.620]   to Vanguard's principles for investment success,
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.340]   I can summarize that in one phrase,
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.820]   which is you're going to increase your success
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.340]   by first controlling what is under your control
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.340]   and managing those things that aren't under your control.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.220]   So what's under your control?
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.620]   Your savings, your spending.
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.500]   You know your tax situation.
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.460]   You know your risks.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.460]   You know your goals.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.740]   What's not under your control?
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.500]   Even though CNBC would like you to think it is,
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.340]   what's the market going to be doing?
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:12.140]   I would extend that to how long is your planning horizon?
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.300]   We make these assumptions.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.620]   This was something I said with Christine on the long view
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.340]   a couple of years back.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.260]   And I said-- and actually, Nick mentioned it a little bit
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.220]   earlier about over-accumulation.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.980]   You know, that's a result of the assumptions
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.860]   that people often make about how you define success
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.700]   in retirement, which is most assumptions
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.340]   about retirement sufficiency assume you retire at 65
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.340]   and you live with certainty to age 95.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:49.020]   So success is defined based on an absolute certainty
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.020]   that you are going to live to age 95.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.460]   You may.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.260]   You probably will not.
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.300]   And now all of a sudden, you think, OK, now
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.020]   what does success mean in that standpoint?
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.700]   So that's kind of the things, taking
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.740]   the uncertainty of longevity into the consideration
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:13.940]   when developing recommendations into the situation.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.420]   So one of the things that we did with this
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.260]   is we have actually created a new--
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.220]   call it a model, but it basically
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.700]   quantifies all these things and tries to integrate them.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.620]   It's called the Vanguard Financial Advice
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.340]   Model, which is really about four components.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.260]   It's a very detailed cash flow simulation after tax.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:38.580]   We basically coded the US tax code
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.500]   and then running cash flow simulations over expected life
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.620]   with the uncertainty of we have no idea what
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.340]   the market is going to do.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.900]   And so we test a whole bunch of different scenarios
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.220]   with the uncertainty of life expectancy.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.620]   You may die at 40.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.940]   You'll probably live to be 85 or older.
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.180]   You may live to be 105, which actually
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.820]   creates a different type of risk from all of those models
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.380]   where it assumes you live to 95.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.220]   And then preferences.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.300]   And this is about focusing on the entire range of outcomes
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.980]   and mitigating those things that could be bad outcomes.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.660]   Because let's face it, not meeting
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.300]   your hopes or your goals or your expectations
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:23.780]   from a spending standpoint is a lot worse than exceeding those
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.700]   in terms of how you feel.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.420]   You had more than enough in that latter case.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.780]   You have not enough in the previous case.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.740]   Not enough is a heck of a lot worse
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.820]   than having more than enough.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.180]   And so how do you account for that?
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.860]   And this is this whole preference thing.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:45.060]   For those that are more in the economic statistical
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:50.740]   standpoint, we can actually calibrate financial planning,
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.340]   things like savings and spending,
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:57.780]   right alongside of investment returns
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.580]   by doing it in this way through things
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:04.180]   we call a utility function and modeling of all that that puts
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.420]   them on the same playing field.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.760]   So that's what we're doing here.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.260]   This is where I need your help.
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.860]   I want you to meet Pete and Kim.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.740]   Pete is 59 years old.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.620]   Kim is 64 years old.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.460]   If you do the math--
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.420]   I won't have you do the math on your own--
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.500]   they have about $1.2 million in assets.
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:29.060]   They are currently spending $80,000 a year.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.380]   Pete has $110,000 annual salary.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.420]   He would like to retire next year, early retirement,
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.120]   join his wife.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.820]   They have other things they want to do besides working.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.820]   And you can see their current allocation
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.060]   in terms of an asset allocation.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:56.060]   60% stocks, all US stocks, 25% bond, 15% cash.
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.820]   They have some Social Security coming
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.500]   at some point in the future.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:06.660]   But my question to you is, if you see this sort of profile,
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.740]   what would be the--
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.500]   and I'll just do one quick math for you.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:20.820]   Their spending as a percent of their overall wealth is 6.7%.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.780]   OK?
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.180]   So what's the-- yes, Rick?
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:34.300]   She will get Social Security--
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.500]   well, that's a question, is how you're
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.860]   choosing Social Security.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.940]   She has not yet.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.340]   That will be one of the integrated recommendations
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.680]   that comes out of this.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.460]   But let's just say--
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.660]   because what Pete wants to do, Pete's 59,
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.260]   and he wants to retire next year.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:58.220]   Christine is sitting here going, there is no way.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.020]   Right?
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.900]   How many of you agree with that?
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.460]   No way.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.220]   Keep working.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.580]   Somebody's-- yeah, keep working.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.700]   Is that what it is?
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.220]   Keep working.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:14.980]   The current-- sorry.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.900]   The current annual benefit is that Social Security
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:23.260]   that Kim has that she has not claimed yet.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.540]   No, he cannot claim Social Security at 60.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.500]   Not saying that he is going to.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.500]   Because she has not claimed either as of right now.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.300]   There is no Social Security currently being claimed
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.060]   and therefore an income.
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.500]   Kim could certainly claim Social Security if she wanted to,
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.540]   but she has not.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:55.060]   All right, here's the deal.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.020]   Let me put it in this terms instead.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.820]   If Pete retires next year, they're
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.900]   going to need to withdraw $80,000 from their investment
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.260]   portfolio to meet their spending.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.620]   OK, with that--
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.020]   Die soon.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:09.520]   What?
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.100]   Die soon.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.060]   There's another strategy.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:16.420]   All right, the point--
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.220]   absolutely.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.060]   We basically are doing things that are--
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.660]   like, hey, look, you can't do this.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.580]   You need to eat your vegetables and work longer
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.580]   or think about this differently.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.700]   Maybe even go back to work or part-time job
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.940]   or whatever it might be.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:37.980]   But that's not their goals.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:43.940]   Can we meet their goals?
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.700]   And are there things that we can do to say, hey, look,
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.920]   we may surface some trade-offs for you,
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.420]   but are there some different things
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.740]   that we can do to meet your goal, Pete's goal of wanting
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.860]   to retire next year?
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.260]   So with that as a little bit of--
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:32:59.760]   yeah?
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:07.180]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.020]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:08.540]   It might.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.040]   Might have--
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.380]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:11.880]   What's that?
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.580]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.740]   If only they had somebody giving them advice, right?
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.260]   Exactly.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.980]   Or surfacing recommendations for what they could do.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.100]   So this is not meant to be a sales pitch for advice,
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.080]   but about thinking about this in a more holistic perspective
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.780]   of what the trade-offs are around both spending, savings,
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.580]   and so forth.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.220]   So let me just show you what this
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.760]   looks like in their current strategy,
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.660]   because any value is not just relative
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:43.500]   to the current situation that they have,
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.700]   their current characteristics, but about what
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.820]   their current investment strategy is, too.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.420]   Too often, we do value calculations as if, well,
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.780]   if you do this, if you do asset location,
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.460]   you can get 50 basis points.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.620]   Well, not if you're currently doing asset location.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.260]   Not if you're currently equally weighted in your asset
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.620]   allocation across your accounts.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.300]   You're not going to get 50 basis points.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.980]   So how do you think about this relative to the current
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.540]   strategy that they are coming to you with?
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.700]   And what this shows is, on the left-hand side,
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.100]   the likelihood of them being able to spend $80,000 a year,
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.740]   which is what they currently say--
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:26.380]   basically, there's a 20% chance that each year,
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.260]   on a real inflation-adjusted basis,
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.180]   they'd be able to spend $80,000 a year
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.980]   if Pete retires next year.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.020]   And so pretty much anything to the left
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:39.580]   reflects risk of shortfall relative to their goal.
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.580]   The right-hand side, it says likelihood of final bequest
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.260]   amount, how much is left when they die.
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.100]   But think of this as actually financial flexibility
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.260]   in retirement.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.740]   Things that are closer to zero, there's
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.660]   not a lot there if something happens.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.980]   And the reason that they get lucky, maybe,
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:03.100]   in certain instances, at the far end of the tail,
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.020]   is because they died early.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.860]   Because this-- or they had really, really
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.380]   outstanding returns in some of the return scenario.
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.740]   This is what you get with a longevity standpoint.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.060]   Yeah, there's a chance they'll be OK.
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.740]   But pretty much, they're not going to be
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.980]   able to spend what they want.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.820]   And they're going to have no flexibility
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.660]   in their financial situation in retirement.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.220]   So with that, let me just sort of--
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.260]   I'm going to actually skip over that real quick.
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.820]   This is, with recommendations, in thinking about it
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:38.540]   from an integrated standpoint, now that 20% chance
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.540]   of having that lifestyle, if you will,
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.600]   is defined by the amount of spending.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.540]   We would say, hey, you know, you could actually
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:49.500]   have a bit of a more of a 70% chance of having this lifestyle
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.860]   by cutting your spending by a bit.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.900]   And also, with different approaches,
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.860]   this will shave or switch your distribution
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:06.220]   to the right on expected amount at the time that you die.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.740]   Now, how did we get there?
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.920]   And again, this will be different
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.680]   for every different client, for every different approach,
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.120]   and so forth.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.760]   So I'm going to focus for a moment on the right-hand side.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.640]   The right-hand side is in kind of investment return space.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.880]   So based on what you're doing today,
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.200]   if you look at the far right-hand side,
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.080]   in this particular situation, we've
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.480]   calculated 218 basis points.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.200]   You would have to do with your investments
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.160]   218 basis points, 2.18% per year,
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.160]   every year better on your investment returns
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.740]   to get the same outcome as if you
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.240]   were to follow these suggested recommendations
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.360]   for your portfolio.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:59.320]   And those recommendations being defer social security,
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:03.680]   fix cash drag and home bias in your portfolio,
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.640]   reduce annual spending, and use tax-smart investing.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.600]   So there's a whole bunch of things that kind of work
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.100]   together.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:18.800]   All right, so here's the question.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.120]   I can predict where Rick is going
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.280]   to go with these questions.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.400]   Is this one-time advice, or is this ongoing?
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.880]   Could you do this as one-time advice?
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.720]   Absolutely.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.600]   Absolutely.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.560]   Will you, I should say, outside of this room,
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.520]   will you actually do it as one-time advice?
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:45.320]   And that's the thing of to be able to realize
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.880]   that there has to be that discipline part of sticking
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.760]   to the long-term investment success principle,
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.640]   and you actually have to execute on that to capture that value.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.640]   And so two things here I just wanted to highlight.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.800]   And again, I knew Rick would be in the audience,
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.200]   so I do want to say, you're accounting for the extra fees
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.520]   or savings in fees.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.840]   You cannot look at value without sort of saying, hey,
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.240]   there's a difference in fees.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.520]   In this case, it was a positive 20 basis point difference
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.160]   in fees, because they were coming from some high-cost
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.040]   mutual funds.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.580]   These are actually some case studies
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.640]   we've actually taken from some real-type situations.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.520]   But then there's also the importance of interaction
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.020]   effects.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.680]   And I can't emphasize this enough.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.920]   This is where we do all of these recommendations one-off.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.440]   We talk about asset location.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.280]   Then we talk about tax-loss harvesting.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.920]   Then we talk about international investing.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.200]   And we do all of the analysis one at a time.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.920]   And then we say, well, in aggregate, it kind of adds up.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.800]   Sometimes it doesn't add up.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:57.400]   Take the case of asset location.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.440]   We can debate what Nick said about asset location later.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.000]   That's not germane for the point.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.800]   Asset location and rebalancing.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.600]   If you asset locate the sort of conventional wisdom way,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.200]   stocks in a taxable account, bonds in a tax-advantaged
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.720]   account, and you were rebalancing,
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.240]   but stocks tend to go up over time more so than bonds,
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:26.400]   you're going to be realizing capital gains, all else equal,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.600]   in the taxable account.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.160]   So the sum of-- if you say, hell,
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.480]   we're rebalancing adds 20 basis points.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.520]   And asset location adds 30 basis points.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.280]   Therefore, you get about 50 basis points.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.200]   No.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.400]   Because you might get 10.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.920]   Yeah, asset location will add some value.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.040]   But it's also not that full value.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.760]   Because once you account for the extra tax of the rebalancing
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.720]   in the taxable account, it's not as strong.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.320]   On the other hand, something like tax loss harvesting
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.760]   and asset location can actually build on each other.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.640]   Because now if you have more of the volatile asset
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.600]   in the taxable account, where if there
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.040]   is value in tax loss harvesting for you,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.880]   you can actually now do more tax loss harvesting.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.920]   And again, if you can realize that value,
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.560]   it can actually be even higher than the sum of the two.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.440]   So that's what this interaction or multi-strategy effects
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.280]   tries to capture, is this integrated approach
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.900]   to doing it.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.200]   So I'm going to leave it there.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.840]   We're already kind of running a little short on time.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.600]   I want to make sure we get to some Q&A.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.560]   But what are the key takeaways here?
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:39.360]   This is all meant to try to get to having Vanguard help clients
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.200]   make high-value life decisions.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.160]   What is your goal and your expectation?
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.360]   Pete wanted to retire at 59.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.760]   It's really easy to say, keep working longer.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.400]   But that's not his goal.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.020]   That's not what's going to get him peace of mind.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.720]   Are there things that we can do to think
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.040]   about that problem maybe a little bit differently?
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.440]   Secondly, investment performance is definitely important.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.280]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.040]   I would never say otherwise.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:09.600]   But financial planning elements and a total plan
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.540]   can provide even better investor outcomes
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:16.120]   and often can make a bigger difference in the return space
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.480]   or so forth than investment performance itself.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.920]   And then third is this all depends on the situation
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.560]   that you're in.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:28.080]   That previous example with Pete and Kim, there was no value.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.760]   Matter of fact, there was negative value
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:35.920]   for Roth conversion proposals or strategies.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.800]   So somebody might go out and say, oh, well,
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.000]   you want a Roth convert because you diversify your tax rate.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.480]   And you might help protect against RMDs once post-72
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.760]   hitting you from a tax torpedo standpoint.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.280]   Nope.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.360]   In the situation that we were looking at, negative value.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.760]   Bad recommendation.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.720]   So it all depends on the situation
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.320]   that you're in and the current strategy that is being employed.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.120]   With that, Susan, turn it over to you.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.440]   And thank you.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.320]   And actually, I'd like to turn it over to you.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.920]   I have a list of questions, but we have eight minutes left.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.480]   So line them up.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.240]   Come on up.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.040]   Ask your questions.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.280]   If for some reason you don't have any, I have plenty.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.640]   But I have a feeling you do have some questions.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.880]   Well, this is just more of a comment.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.320]   That was a very good presentation.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:22.800]   Thank you.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.360]   But I've been thinking about the customer service
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.760]   problem at Vanguard.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.920]   I think I have a solution.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.280]   Either you give us a dedicated phone line for bogel heads,
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.720]   or when you speak to that nice voice recognition lady,
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.440]   say, I am a bogel head, and it shoots you right off
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.400]   just when you're--
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.760]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:54.640]   So let me put it this way.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.960]   I'll take that back.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:04.560]   I would say, though, we're not immune to seeing and hearing
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.160]   about the customer service issues.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.240]   I would say the bogel heads actually
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.520]   do have a very powerful voice.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:17.640]   The website, the bogelheads.org site,
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.640]   is perused daily by senior Vanguard people.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:28.760]   So trust me, we have heard everything
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:34.160]   about the app, about the customer service
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.200]   challenges, and so forth.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.520]   Now, that said, I am more than happy--
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:41.080]   it kind of detracts from the investment piece message.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.120]   And that is a real problem.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.520]   Because if that is what detracts from the potential
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.200]   for achieving investment success, we've lost.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:58.880]   And by we, I mean all of us, because we're
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.120]   here to try to improve the investment
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.600]   success of the investors.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.960]   That said, I know it can be an issue.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.360]   It's a hot topic.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.360]   I am happy to stand out in there in the hallway
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.240]   afterwards, come up, give me whatever feedback you'd like.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.240]   I'll stay as long as you want, and I will take it back.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.520]   I personally cannot do a heck of a lot about it.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.760]   But if you do want to be heard and so forth,
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.320]   I'm happy to do that and kind of organize it.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:30.480]   I would ask for how you have experienced it yourself,
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.400]   though, because what's really important
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.280]   is, are we seeing it in certain areas?
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.360]   Is it certain types of transactions and so forth?
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.240]   That could actually be really helpful from that standpoint.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:45.400]   I don't have a customer service question.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.520]   Vanguard has always led the way in using economies of scale
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.920]   to reduce costs.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   As they push further into the personal advisory space,
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.400]   is there a likelihood that they'll
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.800]   be able to reduce the cost to the individual investor
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.400]   for that service?
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.480]   Right, so I'll go, yeah, you're going
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.320]   to let me handle the strategy.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.000]   Hey, Vanguard, make life better for me.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.280]   He's the head of advice methodology.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.720]   I'm a behavior economist.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.480]   I think he's good.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:17.760]   Thanks, Paulo.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.720]   Paulo's already on my list, by the way,
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.240]   because we were in a team celebration thing
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.840]   for what was his birthday.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:29.320]   And he goes, yeah, today I'm half old.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.080]   And I was like, wait, how old are you?
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.840]   And he said 31.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:40.080]   I was like, well, I said half, half old.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.760]   I have it on tape.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:48.040]   Any case, the PAS, first of all, from an advice standpoint
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.840]   in lowering costs, I mean, there are already
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.000]   kind of multiple avenues at Vanguard.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.800]   We have a personal advisory services, 30 basis points.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.680]   We have 30 basis points plus the underlying fund fees.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.360]   I should say that.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:06.000]   There's a 15 basis point net advisory fee
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.440]   with our digital advisor platform.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.360]   But there's always kind of look, re-evaluation,
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.360]   assessment of cost and service offerings at Vanguard.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.200]   It happens all the time.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.360]   What that might look like, I don't know going forward,
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:27.120]   per se, or in some ways, it's always a discussion.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.160]   I would also say, though, one of the things that we are doing
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.600]   a lot with, and we've talked about it a bit,
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:39.440]   is this concept of what we would call CX alpha or customer
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.640]   experience alpha.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.120]   Not necessarily anything to do with advice.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.400]   But can we help investors?
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.040]   And again, this is for people largely outside of this room.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.760]   But can we help people be better investors?
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.280]   Here's a really good example.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.000]   Every year, we see IRAs being funded.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.760]   People get the message, oh, I should fund my IRA.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.400]   They fund it, and then they leave it in cash.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.680]   OK?
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.360]   If there were something along the journey of,
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:22.640]   as they're investing, a nudge, a reminder, a client experience
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.920]   piece that could help them, not force them,
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.960]   but nudge them to invest, over time,
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.040]   they are going to be better investors.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.960]   And so there's a whole host of those types of things
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.720]   that we're looking at from an experience standpoint that
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.800]   may have nothing to do with advice,
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.560]   but can still help improve outcomes in material ways
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:47.720]   and very low cost ways.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.760]   This question is for Paolo.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.720]   Given the inflationary environment that we are in,
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.160]   what is your insight on the 4% safe withdrawal rule?
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.640]   Because I know that you've been doing some research on that.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.120]   Right.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.840]   Thanks.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.600]   Oh, you're welcome.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   So number one is, I understand the hesitation
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.360]   because of inflation, given that--
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.960]   especially for folks who are early in retirement,
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.840]   because the 4% rule actually adjusts your payments
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.280]   for inflation over time.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.120]   But that's an adjustment pretty early on in retirement,
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:25.240]   and that's going to be baked in for all the rest of retirement.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.920]   But the good thing about the 4% rule
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.480]   is that, I mean, I understand that we haven't seen inflation
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.240]   for a really long time.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.040]   Having said that, the 4% rule was
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:40.760]   tested during the high inflation times of the '70s and the '80s,
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:44.240]   and it still had a high chance of success.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:52.120]   So far, inflation has peaked over the past year,
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.760]   but it's starting to trend down a little bit.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.040]   So hopefully, it will be just a blip.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:02.640]   But so far, the 4% rule is still a good starting point
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.160]   for people in retirement.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.040]   Thank you.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.520]   We have time for one more.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   Oh, oh, no.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.560]   I'm the last one.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.000]   I hope it's a good one.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.080]   So I'm really passionate about time in the market,
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:25.520]   and I got lucky when I was 22 to get good advice from co-workers
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.680]   to invest heavily.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.520]   And I was wondering, what is Vanguard
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:32.600]   doing to try to get the younger people who are just
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.080]   starting their first job to invest because it's
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:40.480]   so critical-- that's literally the most critical time--
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.240]   that they get their money in the market?
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.880]   I just wanted to know if Vanguard has any outreach
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.040]   to maybe high schools or colleges.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.120]   So not so much the outreach to high school and colleges
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.120]   per se, but certainly the young investor
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.200]   in getting on the right path because habits
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:05.080]   that get put in place early tend to persist if we can do that.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.600]   So a couple of things, and one is--
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.280]   I'll turn it over to Paulo to do this.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.360]   But this whole financial wellness piece
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.440]   is really aimed at doing that because--
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.360]   and it's not just about investing.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.080]   It's about that sort of total balance sheet
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.360]   because, I mean, let's face it.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.960]   Paying off debt is saving.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.840]   So how do you get people into the position
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.520]   where they can save and invest to meet their long-term goals?
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.000]   I actually live this right now.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.880]   My son just graduated college, 24 years old,
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.880]   just turned 24 years old, first job.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:50.320]   Thankfully, he asked me what he thought he should do.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.160]   And he has a 401(k) plan at his employer
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.480]   that matches dollar for dollar up to 5%.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:04.080]   And I was like, hey, look, do that.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.600]   Save money in a Roth IRA, which makes sense
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:13.160]   in his personal situation, and forget about everything else
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.280]   because you're on a good path there.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:19.200]   It's a large percent of his annual income
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.160]   that he's saving from those two things.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.240]   And I'm like, live your life.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.520]   Be happy.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.600]   You have the ability, and you can have the peace of mind
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.320]   that, hey, the markets will go up, they'll go down.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:36.640]   But if you're saving, in his case, it's between 17% and 20%
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.240]   with those two recommendations of his pre-tax income,
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:44.120]   if you include the employer match, you know what?
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.200]   For retirement, for 40 years from now,
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.320]   you're in good shape.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:53.760]   We'll figure it out and adjust as need to along the way.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.320]   Yeah, so the two recommendations that Joel just mentioned,
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.480]   obviously getting the employer match, and I mentioned some--
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:02.200]   I mean, 31% of people are not even getting that.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.680]   So starting with the match is extremely important.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.520]   Then fund your Roth IRA.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:12.680]   But to Joel's point, also this recent generation
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.520]   coming out of college now is facing
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.400]   a very different circumstance.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.680]   Student loans are a big thing for them,
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.920]   and people with six digits of that at 22 years old.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.000]   And then there is a question of the trade-offs.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.160]   Do I pay down my debt, or do I save for retirement?
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.320]   And that's why it's so important for us
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.360]   to put out the financial wellness guidance,
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.240]   to talk about the trade-offs.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:41.440]   Because we don't want--
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.240]   we see this on the internet very often.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.640]   I wish I had done this 20 years ago.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.040]   We want to prevent that.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:51.200]   So getting that early and saying the importance of savings.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.800]   But also, to Joel's point, don't necessarily
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.360]   overdo it, because you still have a life to live.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.840]   And especially with these folks, they also
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.240]   have a lot of debt to pay.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.480]   So we have to be mindful of the trade-offs.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   But just getting the match, getting the Roth IRA funded,
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.120]   that already goes a really long way.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.080]   Thanks for the question.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:10.580]   Thank you.
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.520]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.120]   I'd like to thank both of our speakers
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.880]   today, who will be around for additional questions
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.840]   if you have them.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:28.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
