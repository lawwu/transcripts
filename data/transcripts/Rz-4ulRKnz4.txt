[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   The following is a conversation with Jennifer Burns,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.760]   a historian of ideas, including the evolution
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.240]   of economic, political, and social ideas
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.180]   in the United States in the 20th century to today.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.840]   She wrote two biographies, one on Milton Friedman
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.840]   and the other on Ayn Rand, both of which I highly recommend.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.400]   This was a super technical
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.680]   and super fascinating conversation.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.420]   At the end, I make a few comments
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.600]   about my previous conversation with President Zelensky,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.660]   for those of you who may be interested.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.560]   This is "Alex Regional Podcast."
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.760]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.960]   in the description.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.620]   And now, dear friends, here's Jennifer Burns.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.320]   You have written two biographies,
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.380]   one on Milton Friedman and one on Ayn Rand.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.120]   So if we can, we will focus on each one separately,
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.560]   but first, let's talk about the ideas
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.240]   that two of them held in common,
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.040]   the value of individual freedom,
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.880]   skepticism of collectivism, and the ethics of capitalism.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.920]   Can you talk about the big picture ideas they converge on?
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.120]   - Yeah, so Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand,
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.640]   in the biggest picture, they're both individualists,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.440]   and they're skeptical of collectivities and collectivism.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.440]   So their unit of analysis is the individual,
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.680]   what's good for the individual,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.960]   what works for the individual,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.400]   and their understanding of society kind of flows from that.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.640]   They also both use this focus on individualism
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.840]   to justify and to support capitalism
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.080]   as a social and economic system.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.400]   So we can put them in a similar category.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.040]   We can call them individualists,
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.920]   we could call them libertarians of a sort,
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.320]   but they're also really different
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.320]   in how they approach capitalism,
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.320]   how they approach thinking.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.680]   You know, Ayn Rand developed her own moral
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.520]   and philosophical system to justify individualism
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760]   and to connect the individual to capitalism
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.280]   and to support capitalism as a social and economic system.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.800]   Friedman struggles a bit more
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.760]   with how to justify capitalism,
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.800]   and he'll ultimately come down to freedom as his core value,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.760]   like his God, as he says.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.800]   And so freedom does connect back to the individual,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.480]   but he's not justifying capitalism for his own sake,
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.560]   he's justifying it for its ability to underwrite freedom
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.720]   in a social sense and also in the individual sense.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.800]   - At a high level,
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.400]   are there interesting differences between them?
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.720]   You already mentioned a few,
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.080]   maybe in terms of who they are personally,
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.560]   maybe in terms of how they approach
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.240]   the justification for capitalism, maybe other ways.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.080]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.640]   So beyond this idea that Milton Friedman
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.560]   takes a while to come to his justification of capitalism,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.960]   Morzine Rand kind of has it from the start.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   She really focuses on the core quality
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.360]   of rationalism and rationality.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.920]   Rationality is the defining feature of human beings.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.840]   And so she works from there,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.160]   whereas Milton Friedman eventually converges
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.040]   on this idea of freedom.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   So that's one part of it.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.920]   The other is their intellectual styles
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.040]   are really, really different,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.960]   their interpersonal styles are really different.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.760]   So Friedman has big ideas, big principles that guide him,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.720]   but he's also deeply empirical.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.160]   He spends most of his career doing historical research,
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.440]   economic research, pulling data from how people
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.000]   actually make economic decisions and live in the world
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.800]   and using them to test and refine his theories.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.080]   Where Rand, to some degree, we could say she's empirical
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.040]   in that she lives through the Russian revolution
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.360]   and takes a very big lesson from that.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.040]   But her style of thinking is really first principles,
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.600]   an axiomatic approach, going from the basic idea
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.880]   of rationality, and then playing that out
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.320]   in different spheres.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.160]   And so those are just very different
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.520]   intellectual approaches.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.560]   And then they lead in some ways to really different ways
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.080]   of thinking about how you get things done in the world.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.440]   Ayn Rand is a purist.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.120]   She wants to start with the pure belief.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.840]   She doesn't want it to be diluted.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.880]   One of her favorite sayings was,
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.640]   "It's earlier than you think."
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.840]   In other words, we're still moving towards a place
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.080]   where we can really hold and express these ideals purely.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.160]   Friedman, although he didn't use this terminology,
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.280]   was much more half-aloof guy.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.200]   You know, like, "I'll take what I can get,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.600]   and then I'll try to move to where I really wanna be."
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.400]   But he is able to compromise,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.120]   especially when he moves from being an economist
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.520]   into being more of a political thinker.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   And so that's a really different intellectual style.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.360]   And then it also plays out in their lives
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.240]   in that Ayn Rand is incredibly schismatic.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.960]   I mean, she wants her friends to believe what she believes
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.240]   and support what she supports.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.080]   And she's willing to break a relationship
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.080]   if it doesn't match.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.320]   Milton Friedman, he also does tend to have friends
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.480]   who agree with him,
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.040]   yet he's always willing to debate his opponents,
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.440]   and he's willing to do so with a smile on his face.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.960]   You know, he's the kind of, he's the happy warrior.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.040]   And he actually will win a lot of debates
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.200]   simply by his emotional affect
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.640]   and his cheerfulness and his confidence,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.200]   where Rand will lose debates
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.000]   because she gets so angry in the face of disagreement.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.360]   So yeah, they have a lot of similarities
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.320]   and a lot of differences,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.640]   and it's been really fascinating
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.560]   to kind of dive deep into both of them.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.920]   - I just re-listened to Ayn Rand's, I think, last lecture,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.520]   or at least it's called that,
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.880]   and just the confrontational nature
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.560]   of how she answers questions
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.600]   or how she addresses critics and so on.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.240]   There is a kind of charisma to that.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.360]   So I think both of them are very effective
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.480]   at winning over sort of popular support,
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.680]   but in very different styles.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.320]   It seems like Ayn Rand is very cranky,
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.240]   but there's, I mean,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.600]   it's the most charismatic, cranky person,
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.160]   I think, I've ever listened to.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.600]   - Yeah, I mean, people talked about her,
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.240]   meeting her and coming to believe in her ideas
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.840]   in a similar way as they did with Marxism,
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.520]   in that suddenly everything made sense,
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.960]   and that when they came to believe in objectivism,
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.080]   they felt they had this engine
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.240]   for understanding the entire world.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.280]   Now, after a while,
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.040]   for most people that then became confining,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.640]   but yeah, that certainty,
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.320]   and Friedman had some of that as well.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.800]   He clothed it differently.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.160]   He clothed it in happiness,
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.200]   where Rand kind of closed it, as you said,
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.920]   in crankiness or anger.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.600]   I mean, there's also an arc to Rand.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.440]   She gets kind of angrier and angrier
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.320]   and crankier and crankier over the course of her life.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.480]   What I enjoyed about my research
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.360]   is I was able to get into this early moment
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.040]   when she was different and a little more open,
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.880]   and then I kind of watched her close
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.880]   and her harden over time.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.000]   - Would it be fair to say that Milton Friedman
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.080]   had a bit more intellectual humility,
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.360]   where he would be able to sort of evolve over time
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.040]   and be convinced by the reality of the world
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.080]   to change sort of the nuances of policies,
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.760]   the nuances of how he thought about economics
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   or about the world?
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.040]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.880]   Friedman believed in being able to say I was wrong,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.400]   and there are some things he said he was wrong about.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.840]   We'll delve more into monetarism and monetary policy,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.800]   but he was able to talk about the ways
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.560]   his ideas hadn't mapped onto the world
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.680]   the way he thought they would.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   He does a really interesting interview
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.920]   at the end of his life where he's beginning to voice
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.040]   some doubts about globalization,
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   you know, which was,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.760]   he was sort of a prophet of globalization,
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.040]   a cheerleader of globalization.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.760]   He really thought it would lead to a better world
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.080]   in all respects.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.080]   And towards the end of his life,
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.640]   it's about two years before he dies,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.600]   there's a note of doubt about how globalization unfolded
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.960]   and what it would mean,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.840]   particularly for the American worker.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.880]   And so you can see him still thinking,
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.680]   and that to me, I had sort of assumed
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.320]   he became crankier and crankier
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.760]   and more and more set in his ways.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.360]   And of course there's a phase where he does become that way,
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.880]   especially if he's in the public eye
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.720]   and there's not room for nuance.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.360]   But to find in the last years of his life,
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.160]   him being so reflective,
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.040]   that was absolutely not something Rand could do.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.520]   - I think there's a thread throughout this conversation
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.680]   where we should actually also say
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.040]   that you're kind of a historian of ideas.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.840]   - I am a historian of ideas, yes.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.160]   - And so we're talking about today in part
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.400]   about two people who kind of fought for ideas,
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.160]   for an idea like we've mentioned, freedom for capitalism,
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.680]   and they did it in very different ways.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.520]   And it's so interesting to see sort of the impact
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.520]   they both had and how their elucidation explanation
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.160]   of those ideas reverberated throughout society
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.180]   and how we together as a society figure out what works,
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.520]   the degree to which they have influence on the public,
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.820]   the degree to which they have influence
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.280]   on individual administrations,
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.840]   like the Reagan administration, Nixon, and so on,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.960]   and how it might return, like fade away,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.900]   and then come back in the modern times.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.320]   And it's so interesting if you just see
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.440]   this whole world as a game of ideas
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.480]   where we were like pushing and pulling
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.700]   and trying to figure stuff out.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.680]   A bunch of people got real excited
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.640]   over a hundred years ago about communism,
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.880]   and then they tried stuff out,
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.040]   and then the implementation broke down,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.240]   and we keep playing with ideas.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.760]   So these are the two greats of playing with ideas.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.920]   But I think that's a thread that just runs through this.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.400]   - Yeah, and of kind of pushing back against that movement
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.280]   towards communism, social democracy.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.800]   But one difference that I really should emphasize,
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.920]   Rand is a writer of fiction.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.080]   She's a philosopher, but she's also a writer of fiction.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.440]   So she is working almost in a mythic register,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.400]   much more in a psychological register.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.280]   She's creating characters that people identify with
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.120]   and people relate to experiences they've had.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.040]   And that's one of the reasons she hits so deep.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.960]   And she's also offering people,
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.520]   I read all the fan letters to her.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.720]   People would say things like,
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.640]   "I read 'The Fountainhead,'
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.300]   and now I'm getting a divorce."
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.080]   You know? - Yeah.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.200]   - You know, having just these incredible realizations.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.600]   - Milton Friedman didn't get such things.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.960]   - Milton Friedman didn't get such things.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.800]   Or I'll meet someone and they'll say to me,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.600]   "Ayn Rand is the reason I went to medical school."
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.760]   You know, like a woman said this to me a few years back.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.720]   "It never even occurred to me that I could be a doctor
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.880]   until I read Ayn Rand."
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.840]   And I said, "I'm gonna go to medical school."
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.760]   And so she has a really intense impact on people.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.080]   So she thought of herself as rational.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.060]   She thought of rationality as kind of what she was doing,
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.880]   but she was actually doing a kind of mythopoetic,
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.800]   psychological work as well.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.080]   Whereas Friedman, on the one hand, was much more rational.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.120]   There's a whole set of economic thinking
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.960]   and he provides a rational framework
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.560]   for understanding the world.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.520]   And it's the framework of, you know, neoclassical economics.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.640]   At the same time, he does pull on mythologies, you know,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.760]   of the idea of America in the Gilded Age,
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.120]   the frontier mythology, the individual immigrant,
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.160]   the settler mythology.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.520]   He pulls on these, but he doesn't create them.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.560]   And they are, he's more kind of playing a tune
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.740]   he already has.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.080]   Whereas I think Rand really does something
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.680]   a little bit deeper in her ability
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.840]   to reach into people's psyche
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.460]   and then take that emotional, psychological experience
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.040]   and fuse it to an intellectual world and a political world.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.220]   And that's really what makes her so powerful.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.040]   And so I think she comes back in to relevancy
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.360]   in a different way than Friedman does,
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.920]   because I think in some way she's tapped
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.760]   into a kind of more universal human longing
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.800]   for independence and autonomy
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.180]   and kind of self-creation and self-discovery.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.540]   - Nevertheless, there's still pragmatic ideas
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.980]   that are still important today for Milton Friedman,
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.660]   even just in the economics level.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.200]   So let's dig in.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.740]   Let me try, I took some notes.
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.460]   Let me try to summarize who Milton Friedman is,
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.340]   and then you can correct me.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.900]   Okay, so he is widely considered to be one of the greatest
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.060]   and most influential economists in history,
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.540]   not just the 20th century, I think, ever.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.780]   He was an advocate of economic freedom, like we said,
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.940]   and just individual freedom in general.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.820]   He strongly advocated for free market capitalism
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.420]   and limited government intervention in the economy.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.100]   Though you do give, I've listened to basically everything
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.560]   you have on the internet.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.380]   You give some more depth and nuance
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.540]   on his views on this in your books.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:57.020]   He led the famed Chicago School of Economics,
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:01.260]   and he won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976.
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.580]   He greatly influenced economic policies
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.020]   during the Reagan administration and other administrations.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.900]   He was an influential public intellectual,
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.060]   highly influential, not just among economists.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.060]   He lived 1912 to 2006, so that means he lived
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.420]   and worked through some major world events
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.020]   where his ideas were really important.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.700]   The Great Depression with the New Deal,
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.740]   World War II with the post-war Reconstruction,
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.700]   the rise and fall of the Bretton Woods monetary system,
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.180]   as we may talk about, the Cold War,
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.180]   and all the conflicts involved in that,
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.760]   sort of the tensions around communism and so on,
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.340]   so the fall of the Soviet Union.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.300]   And also he has some interesting relationships
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:51.300]   to China's economic transformation since the 1970s,
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.620]   the stagflation of the 1970s,
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.420]   and I'm sure there's a lot more, so.
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.140]   Can you maybe continue this thread
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.340]   and give a big picture overview
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.340]   of the ideas he is known for?
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.780]   - Yeah, sure, and that's a great summary.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.500]   You learn fast, so let me start with the economics,
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.200]   and then I can kind of transition
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.560]   to how he used those economic ideas
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.460]   to become a real voice in the American conservative movement
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.600]   and the American political realm.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.100]   So I'll kind of highlight four ideas
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.940]   or contributions or episodes.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.940]   One was his work with Anna Schwartz
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.980]   in revising our understanding of the Great Depression,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.900]   and that's tightly related to the second,
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.860]   which is the school of monetarism
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.220]   that he and Schwartz really become founders of.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:45.860]   Then there is the prediction of stagflation
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.780]   and the explanation of that in the 1970s,
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.880]   which really is one of these sort of
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.240]   career-making predictions, and we can dig into that.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.560]   And then in terms of technical economics,
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.020]   he's known for the permanent income hypothesis,
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.980]   which he develops with a group of female collaborators
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:04.820]   that I can talk about.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.480]   So those are kind of four technical pieces
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.440]   and being really brought together
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.200]   in what becomes the Chicago School of Economics.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.480]   He's undoubtedly the head and the leader
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.480]   of the Chicago School of Economics.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.360]   There's an earlier generation that he learns from.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.020]   There's his generation.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.780]   There's also a Chicago School of Law and Economics
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.100]   that's really profoundly influential.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.380]   And then there'll be kind of a third generation
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.300]   that he's somewhat distinct from,
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.700]   but that goes on to really shape economics.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.520]   But let me go back to these kind of four pieces
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.680]   and let me start with the Great Depression.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.980]   So Milton Friedman actually lives
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.620]   through the Great Depression.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.900]   He's in college when it hits,
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.900]   and he is, so he's in college, it's 1928 to 1932.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.860]   And he's aware of the depression and he's deciding,
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.220]   should I study mathematics or should I study economics?
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.080]   And he hasn't, he's had some good economics teachers,
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.500]   but it's really the context.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.700]   It's looking around at the slow dissolving
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.340]   of economic prosperity.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.700]   So he decides to go to Chicago.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.760]   He decides to study economics.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.300]   And what's really interesting is that
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.260]   the Great Depression is so unexpected,
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.820]   it's unpredicted, it's unprecedented,
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.820]   and economists are really struggling
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.460]   to know how to respond to it.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.940]   And so he's gonna arrive at the University of Chicago
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.820]   when the field is struggling to know what to do.
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.660]   So he's in this kind of really open space
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.380]   where the institutional economics of the 1920s
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.420]   has failed to predict, which was focused on business cycles.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.260]   This is the irony.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.900]   Their big thing was charting
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.540]   and understanding business cycles.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.500]   And then we have the biggest business cycle of all time
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.800]   and they haven't seen it coming
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.060]   and they don't have a good explanation for it.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.980]   And what he will get at Chicago
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.980]   is the remnants of a monetary understanding of the economy.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.740]   And so his teachers,
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.600]   they don't know exactly what's going on,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.020]   but they look first to the banking crisis.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.100]   They look first to the, in 1933, it's bank runs,
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.740]   failures of maybe it's up to a third of American banks.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.100]   It's huge, thousands of banks are failing per week.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.300]   So they're focused on that.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.480]   So that's the first kind of imprint he will have.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.260]   The Great Depression has something to do
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.040]   with a banking system.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.660]   The second imprint he will have
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.820]   is that all of his professors are profoundly concerned
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.740]   about the social crisis.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.780]   They want relief programs.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.980]   They want them now.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.340]   They want bank regulation and financial reform.
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.460]   They're very active.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.540]   This is not laissez-faire
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.660]   by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.160]   So Friedman has that imprinting and then about,
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.420]   so that's, he gets there in '32, '36, '37,
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.220]   the ideas of John Maynard Keynes from Britain,
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.800]   which has a different explanation.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.780]   Keynes has a different explanation of the Great Depression,
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.820]   will kind of make landfall in American economics
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.140]   and be very profoundly influential
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.900]   on most American economists.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.820]   But Friedman already, it's too late for Friedman.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.820]   He already has a different perspective.
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.420]   So Keynesianism unfolds.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.140]   I can say more about that,
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.700]   but it basically leads to more active
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.620]   federal government participation in the economy.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.420]   And what underlies a lot of that,
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.060]   its adaptation in America particularly,
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.840]   is the idea that capitalism has failed.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.840]   Capitalism has revealed itself to have a profound flaw
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.260]   in that its cycles of boom and bust
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.580]   create social instability, chaos.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.580]   It needs to be tamed.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.220]   It needs to be regulated.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:54.220]   And so that becomes the kind of baseline of politics
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.120]   in the United States, the understanding of the New Deal,
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.920]   the understanding of the Democratic Party,
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.760]   even to some extent,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.180]   the understanding of the Republican Party.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.940]   And Friedman never quite sure about that.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.040]   He has a hunch that there's something else going on,
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.980]   and he does not buy that capitalism
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.540]   has sort of ground to a halt.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.220]   Or the other idea is that capitalism
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.140]   has gone through some sort of phase transition,
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.700]   and it worked great maybe while we had a frontier.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.380]   This is a very serious argument that people are making.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.780]   United States used to have a frontier,
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.820]   a place where Europeans hadn't fully settled.
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.140]   Of course, they're pushing out the native tribes.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:30.980]   That's another story.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.600]   But that this frontier is the engine of economic growth,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.680]   and the frontier is now over, it's closed,
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.980]   and we're gonna stagnate.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.220]   And there's a theory of secular stagnation.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.300]   And so to deal with secular stagnation,
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.820]   we're just gonna have to have a more active state.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.940]   So Friedman is suspicious of all these assumptions.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.680]   And he has this idea that it's something to do with money.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.940]   Money is somehow important.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.900]   And so he joins together with Anna Schwartz,
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.900]   who is an economist.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.100]   She doesn't at this time hold a PhD.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.600]   She's working for the National Bureau of Economic Research.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.700]   And they come together to do this study of money
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.260]   in the US economy.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.700]   And it takes them 12 years to write the book.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.660]   And they're releasing their ideas, and they're arguing,
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.660]   and Friedman is writing papers, giving talks,
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.820]   saying money's really important.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.540]   And nobody's really believing him.
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.380]   He's a crank.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.740]   He's at Chicago.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.380]   Chicago's a well-known university,
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.460]   but he's sort of considered a crank.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.580]   And then in '63, he and Anna Schwartz publish this book,
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.700]   and it's 800 pages.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.980]   It's a reinterpretation of the history of the United States
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.300]   through money, like the central character is money,
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.660]   whether it's BC, greenback, or the US currency.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.500]   And they have a whole chapter on the Great Depression.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.700]   And what they've literally done,
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.160]   Schwartz has done most of this,
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.380]   they've gone, Schwartz has gone to banks
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.500]   and said, "Show me your books."
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.020]   And then she's added up, column by column,
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.420]   how much money is in your vault,
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.140]   how much money is on deposit,
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.660]   how much money is circulating.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.300]   And so they literally have graphs,
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.900]   you can see them in the book,
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.580]   of how much money has been circulating in the US
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.820]   at various different points in time.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.340]   And when they get to the Great Depression,
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.820]   they find the quantity of money available in the economy
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.620]   goes down by a third.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.560]   And in some ways, this is completely obvious
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.340]   because so many banks have failed,
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:25.280]   and we don't have any type of bank insurance at that point.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.220]   So if your bank goes under, your savings are there,
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.000]   the money essentially vanishes.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.480]   And it's fractional reserve banking, right?
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.860]   So you've put in, they can loan up to 90% on their deposits.
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.460]   And so, Friedman and Schwartz present this argument
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.020]   that what really made the Great Depression so bad
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.840]   was this drop in the amount of money,
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.140]   the 30% drop in the money.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.180]   They call it the Great Contraction.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.340]   And then they go further and they say,
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.820]   "Well, how did this happen and why?"
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.400]   And they pinpoint the Federal Reserve,
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.760]   which is a fairly new institution at that time.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.060]   And they say, "What did the Federal Reserve do,
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.220]   "the lender of last resort?
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.380]   "What did it do in the face of what they're depicting
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.380]   "as a massive unprecedented liquidity crisis?"
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.620]   And they find it's not really doing much.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.380]   And they really dig into the details,
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.220]   and they find that the Federal Reserve
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.180]   has gone through a sort of personnel change,
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.860]   and some of the key leaders in the 1920s,
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.060]   Benjamin Strong is one of them, he's now deceased.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.860]   And the dominance of the New York Federal Reserve,
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:30.740]   which in their telling is global, it's interconnected,
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.500]   it's seen a lot of financial things come and go,
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.380]   and they believe that the New York Fed had the understanding
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.180]   to recognize this is a liquidity crisis,
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.580]   we should be very generous,
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.520]   we should support all the banks.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.080]   Their influence has diminished
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.220]   for the kind of banks that are more,
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.780]   they don't say like the Rubes and the Hicks,
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.660]   but it basically is.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.220]   It's like the people in charge
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.220]   don't know what they're doing.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.920]   And so the Fed pursues this kind of policy
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.200]   of masterly inactivity.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.820]   They don't see it as a problem.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.780]   They don't do much.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.140]   There's an enormous liquidity crisis.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.940]   And that's their version
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.140]   of what the Great Depression is all about,
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.580]   that it's a financial system meltdown,
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.660]   it's a liquidity crisis, and that in some ways,
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.460]   well, in many ways, they argue
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.820]   very strong counterfactual argument.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.260]   The Federal Reserve could have prevented it, and it did not.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.120]   And so it becomes then an institutional failure
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.880]   and a political failure,
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.120]   not a failure of capitalism as a system.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.520]   And so this book comes out, it's a blockbuster.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.700]   And even those economists,
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.680]   who've been like, "Friedman is a crank, I don't buy it,"
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.900]   are like, "Friedman and Schwartz are onto something.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.920]   "Milton Friedman, Anna Schwartz are onto something."
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.720]   And so that really changes the game.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.360]   And this is also one
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.760]   of his most influential contributions,
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.640]   because "Friedman and Schwartz" becomes the playbook
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.160]   for the Federal Reserve.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.080]   And we have lived through this, right?
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.440]   In the financial crisis,
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.920]   the Federal Reserve is ready to loan.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.200]   COVID, the Federal Reserve does all kinds of new things,
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.680]   because no Federal Reserve chair wants to be
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.120]   in "Friedman and Schwartz 2.0" that somebody writes,
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.100]   or they're the bad guy who let the economy meltdown.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.440]   So the specifics of what they say to do
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.380]   have obviously evolved as the system has changed,
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.360]   but this is a playbook
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.440]   for how to deal with economic crisis.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.480]   It's "Friedman and Schwartz."
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.960]   And so it's absolutely fundamental,
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   and that is really going to be the place he makes his mark.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.480]   - There's a lot of things to say here.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.800]   So first, the book we're talking about
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.760]   is "A Monetary History of the United States,"
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.440]   in part, for which Milton Friedman won the Nobel Prize.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.560]   You've also mentioned the influence of the Great Depression.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.720]   If you could even just rewind to that.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.920]   - Yes. - So he went to,
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.680]   I guess, college in Rutgers.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.520]   - That's right.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.200]   - And he was, you know, mathematical proclivities.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.120]   So he was kind of wanting to be a mathematician.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.120]   And so it's kind of a cool crossroads.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   It's interesting how the right time,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.960]   the right person arrives, right?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.780]   So you described this really well,
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.960]   that he had this choice to be a mathematician
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.800]   or an economist.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.360]   And economist is University of Chicago,
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.280]   mathematician is Brown University, whichever.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.000]   And then this is also the beginnings,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.320]   as you've described, of mathematical economics.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.400]   So he fits in nicely into this using,
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.200]   I think you said the number of equations
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.000]   started going up per paper,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.680]   which is a really nice way to put it.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.920]   So really the right person at the right time
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.760]   to try to solve this puzzle of the economy melting down.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.600]   It's so interesting.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.120]   It's one human, it's just from just zooming in,
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.440]   I know a single human making a decision about life.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.920]   And it's hard to know when you're in it
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.520]   that the world is melting down
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.560]   from an economics perspective,
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.740]   and that I could do something about this
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.120]   to figure out what it is.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.280]   And also I'm going to reject the mainstream narrative
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.080]   about why this happened.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.600]   - Yeah, so the other piece of the puzzle
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.900]   when he goes to Rutgers, he thinks he'll be an actuary.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.880]   So Milton Friedman's family, his parents are immigrants,
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.220]   Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.600]   They're pretty atypical in that they don't stay in New York,
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.400]   and they move to Raleigh, New Jersey,
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.280]   and they put together a fairly middle-class life
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.280]   as kind of, they have a shop,
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.840]   they do some wholesale buying and selling,
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.080]   and then his father dies when he's 16.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.840]   His life becomes more precarious,
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.220]   but it's never as precarious as he makes it out to be.
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.680]   He's got three older sisters, they earn a good living,
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.240]   incidentally they all have better grades in high school
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.840]   than he does, but he's the one that goes to college.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.440]   And, but it's actually really important
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.040]   that he loses his father figure,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.800]   because he's then looking for other father figures,
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.480]   and he meets two at Rutgers.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.340]   One is Arthur Burns, who will go on to have
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.320]   a huge influence in his career.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.300]   No relation to me, by the way,
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.820]   but Arthur Burns is like him,
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.660]   a fellow Jewish immigrant boy on the make.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.800]   He's older, and he's making a career as an economist.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.040]   And then there's Homer Jones,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.940]   who has gone to the University of Chicago,
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.880]   and is studying with Frank Knight at Chicago,
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.800]   and says, you have to go to Chicago.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.320]   So he has these two mentors,
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.000]   and Burns in particular suggests,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.080]   oh, I could be an economist, that could be my career path.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.480]   You know, the idea to be an actuary for an insurance company,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.800]   I'm not sure where he got that idea,
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.040]   but he just thought that was something he could do
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.220]   as someone who was good at math.
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.000]   And so the college really opens,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.240]   the perspective opens the door.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.560]   And then I think it's really key that, again,
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.100]   he doesn't get an explanation
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.040]   that he buys for the Great Depression,
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.720]   so then he's looking for one.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.280]   And the math part is a really interesting aspect
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.520]   of his career.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.440]   Now, he actually comes to Chicago
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.480]   to study with the mathematical economist, Henry Schultz,
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.820]   but he gets there, and he thinks Schultz is kind of dumb.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.880]   He really does.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.400]   He's incredibly arrogant,
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.820]   and he just thinks this guy's not that smart.
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.500]   And it seems that, I mean,
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.080]   Schultz did some really important work
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.320]   in the early stages of mathematical economics,
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.460]   but a lot of the oral histories about him are like,
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.280]   yeah, he wasn't that bright.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.640]   So Friedman's maybe onto something.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.480]   So he falls into the set of students
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.820]   who are really enthralled
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.040]   with his other professor, Frank Knight.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.120]   And Frank Knight is against math and economics.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.640]   Frank Knight is like a neoclassical economist,
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.440]   but not a mathematical economist.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.120]   He's an old-school liberal.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.640]   He's really concerned about liberal democracy,
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.840]   economic liberalism.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.320]   And Friedman is very deeply influenced by Knight,
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.640]   and he continues to pursue mathematical economics.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.520]   So he'll go, for part of his graduate career,
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.040]   he goes to Columbia University,
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.640]   where he actually gets his PhD from,
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.160]   and he works with a mathematical economist there.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.920]   And so he comes out trained
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   in what will eventually be econometrics,
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.440]   and statistics and economics.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.220]   His early publications are in statistics,
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.400]   but it's not really where his intellectual heart and soul are.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.800]   And eventually he will turn very profoundly
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.160]   against mathematics and economics,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.280]   and become a sort of heterodox strain
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.720]   throughout 20th century economics that says,
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.480]   simple models are better.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:38.120]   We need to work on empirical, work off empirical data,
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.680]   not construct elegant models.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.240]   And becomes really sort of counter-cultural
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.720]   within economics in that way.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.200]   - And the test of a good model
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.720]   is it should actually predict stuff that happens.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.000]   - It should predict stuff that happen.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.920]   It should tie back to what's going on.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.240]   - I'm wondering which direction to go.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.840]   So first, actually, if we could zoom out
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.980]   on the different schools of economics.
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.820]   - Yeah.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.680]   - Just the basics.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.240]   You mentioned neoclassical, we mentioned Keynesian economics,
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.320]   we mentioned, what else did we mention?
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.960]   Well, the Chicago School of Economics.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.800]   - Right.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.880]   - Where does Austrian economics fit into that pile,
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.600]   and Marxian economics?
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.920]   And can we just even just linger
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.600]   and try to redefine Keynesian economics,
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.640]   and Chicago School of Economics,
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.600]   and neoclassical economics, and Austrian economics?
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.600]   'Cause there's some overlap and tension.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.120]   - Okay, so schools of economics.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.320]   So we could start with classical economics.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.080]   Classical economics, we could think of Adam Smith
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.680]   as kind of your classic classical economist,
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.480]   the founder of the discipline.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.440]   Classical economics does not really use math,
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.840]   is very close to political economy.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:51.040]   It's concerned with, as Smith puts it,
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.160]   the wealth of nations.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.400]   It's concerned to some degree with distribution.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.680]   It's concerned to some degree
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.360]   with what makes a good political system.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.360]   And what tends to really define classical economics
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.080]   when you're looking from a great distance
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.680]   is what's called the labor theory of value.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.600]   So where does value come from in classical economics?
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.480]   It comes from the labor that a person puts into it.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.720]   So maybe this in some ways comes from Locke's notion
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.360]   of property, that you kind of mingle your labor
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.720]   with the natural world.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.400]   We can say labor theory of value.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:31.120]   So classical economics concerned with,
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.440]   Smith is arguing against mercantilism
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.800]   for more free trade.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.080]   Often goes by the name of political economy
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.440]   to show it's more capacious.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.680]   It's thinking of politics and economics.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.480]   You can still read these books today.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.200]   The sentences are long, the words are different,
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.120]   but you can still follow along.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.320]   So the real big transition from classical economics
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.920]   and political economy to economics,
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.000]   as it's understood today,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.480]   comes with the marginal revolution.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.320]   And the marginal revolution is a scientific revolution
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.920]   that happens in a couple of different places
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   simultaneously, right?
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.560]   This is one of these things that you see
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.560]   in the history of science.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.560]   Like, you know, there'll be some breakthrough,
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.000]   like Darwin has a breakthrough,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.880]   but like somebody else has sort of the same breakthrough
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.280]   at the same time, totally, you know, differently.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.960]   So there's a version of marginalism that's continental,
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.920]   that, you know, there's a version
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.160]   in the German-speaking lands,
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.600]   in the French-speaking lands, and in Britain,
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.480]   and they all kind of come together.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.600]   And the shift is in the theory of value.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   So the theory of value in marginalism is on the margin.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:42.400]   So say you have one apple and you want a second one,
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.400]   how much is going from one apple to two apple worth for you?
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.440]   Probably quite a bit.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.640]   If you had 10 apples, maybe going to 11 apples
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   doesn't matter that much.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.800]   The marginal value is less.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.280]   So what marginalism does though, most importantly,
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.960]   is it opens the door to math and economics,
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.520]   because it means you can graph this now.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.840]   You can depict this relationship graphically.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.760]   And there's some really interesting work
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.920]   in the history of economics that shows a lot of the people
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.360]   who developed marginalism were looking to physics
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.360]   as a model, physics, the queen of the sciences.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:26.360]   And so they were thinking, they imported terms
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.320]   from the natural world to describe the social world
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.680]   through the lens of economics, terms like equilibrium.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.800]   So the idea being that if you looked at a market,
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.160]   a market would reach equilibrium
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.600]   when everybody has bought and sold all that they want,
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.800]   or the price will settle at an equilibrium price
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.920]   when it's really the demand and supply are matching up.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.800]   - And some of these ideas are things we would pick up
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.960]   at a microeconomics class?
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.600]   - Oh, yes, this is still out there.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.680]   This is sort of the basic foundation of microeconomics,
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.200]   marginal analysis.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.120]   And so in the German-speaking intellectual tradition,
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.320]   this is the root of Austrian economics.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.680]   And people picking up the marginal revolution
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.760]   in the German-speaking lands are opposed to the historicists
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.200]   who are thinking in a more evolutionary way
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.080]   about how societies kind of grow and change
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:29.080]   and they have a vision of economic ideas
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.560]   as applying differently
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.000]   to different types of social arrangements.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.640]   Or the marginalists, remember, are inspired by physics,
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:42.000]   and this is a set of natural laws that applies anywhere
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.480]   to any sort of human society.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.840]   So that's this first really big fissure
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.560]   that we'll see again and again.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.560]   Are you historically minded?
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.600]   Do certain traits of economic life in here,
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.120]   adhere, and become expressed in certain types of societies?
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.200]   Or are there universal economic laws
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.280]   that flow through any type of society?
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.840]   So that's kind of a juncture, a break.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.360]   And so marginalism,
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.120]   first, people start using really geometry
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.320]   to kind of graph things,
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.360]   but marginalism is also opening up
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.320]   to the possibility of calculus
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.960]   and the possibility of creating models.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.040]   But at that point in time, late 19th century,
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.760]   a model is something like a physicist does.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.400]   Like, think of like an inclined plane
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.440]   and how fast does the ball roll from one to the other?
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.960]   It's a physical representation of the world.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.080]   And eventually, economists will start to create
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.720]   mathematical representations of the world.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.840]   But we're not quite there yet.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.080]   So we're in late 19th century and we have this fissure,
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.520]   we have this introduction of marginal analysis
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.080]   that marks the juncture
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.800]   from classical economics to economics.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.000]   So let's say now we have economics,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   but we still have this fissure between historical thinking
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.680]   and let's call it natural law thinking.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.520]   That's not quite right,
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.560]   but physical laws versus contingency.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.600]   And then in the United States,
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.000]   this ends up mapping onto debates about capitalism.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.560]   And so more historically minded economists
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.320]   tend to be interested in the progressive movement,
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.960]   and which is invested in taming
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.920]   and regulating industrial capitalism
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.280]   and changing its excesses.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.960]   Factory safety laws, wage laws, working conditions laws.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.520]   Yet in general, American economists
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.760]   all use marginal analysis just in different ways.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.560]   The ones who are more drawn to marginal analysis
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.760]   become known as neoclassical economists.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.160]   They're neoclassical,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.680]   the neo is because they're using marginal analysis.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.080]   The classical is because they don't think
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.880]   we need to change the way the economy operates
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.800]   or the government operates.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   They're not progressive.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.200]   Whereas the progressives are saying things like,
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.760]   we need to use social control.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.560]   The state and the people collectively and democratically
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.480]   need to control the way economics unfolds
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.800]   and make sure things are fair and equal.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.200]   So that school of thought
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.880]   becomes known as institutional economics
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.160]   in the United States by the 20th century.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.000]   So it's part of the progressive movement,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.600]   late 19th century, into the 20th century,
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.000]   it really becomes institutional economics.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.320]   And it's quite dominant.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.560]   And the neoclassical economists are still there,
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.640]   but they're very much a minority.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.520]   And Frank Knight, Milton Friedman's teacher,
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.880]   is one of the minority neoclassical economists.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.120]   And the institutionalists are much more progressive.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.280]   Still.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.360]   - Is it fair to say that the neoclassical folks
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.800]   and even the classical folks
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.080]   versus the institutional economics folks,
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.680]   they have a disagreement
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.760]   about how much government intervention
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.400]   there should be in the economy.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   So neoclassical is less intervention.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.560]   And then institutional economists,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.560]   the progressive folks, has more intervention.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.520]   - Yes, yes, exactly right.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.840]   So this is the situation in the 1920s.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.200]   But the other piece I should mention
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   is the first generation of progressive economists
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.760]   were very radical.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.960]   They were closely allied with the socialist movement,
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.800]   with labor radicalism.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.680]   And many of them lost their jobs at universities.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.360]   This kind of connects to the early,
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.680]   the dawn of academic freedom.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.600]   This is before academic freedom.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.000]   And they became, they were chastened.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   They became much more mainstream.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.520]   By the time we get to the 1920s,
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.000]   we don't really have radical critiques
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.400]   of society coming from economists.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.440]   Much smaller profession,
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.680]   much less important than it is today.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.800]   And fairly peaceful,
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.440]   because the 1920s are a fairly peaceful decade
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.720]   in the United States.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.320]   So this is a situation when the Great Depression hits.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.880]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.920]   the head, the kind of most important
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.880]   institutional economist is Wesley Mitchell.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.120]   And he has said,
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.600]   he's written a whole book on business cycles.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.600]   But he doesn't see this business cycle coming
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.440]   and it hits
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.160]   and he doesn't have a good explanation for it.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.640]   Now, perhaps the preeminent neoclassical economist
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.800]   was Irving Fisher.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.440]   Now Irving Fisher is big into the stock market.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.640]   And Irving Fisher says sometime in late summer, 1929,
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.880]   stocks are going ever higher
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.840]   and will continue to go ever higher forever.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.600]   And so he loses his reputation
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.760]   after the stock market crash.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.440]   So Milton Friedman is stepping into a field
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.560]   in which the greats have been discredited
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.200]   and there's an enormous economic crisis all around.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.480]   - And everybody's struggling to figure out
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.000]   why the crisis happened.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.160]   - Yes, and the other thing he's stepping into
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.120]   is a world where in the United States,
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.880]   there's a great deal of anger at capitalism,
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.360]   at the system, unemployed people on the street.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.520]   In Europe, there's rising fascist movements.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.000]   In Asia, there's rising fascist movements.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.200]   And so everyone's very concerned about this.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.480]   And Friedman is seeing a lot of this
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.040]   through the lens of Frank Knight,
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.160]   who feels like we are maybe reaching the end
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.960]   of what he calls liberalism.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.720]   He calls himself an old-fashioned liberalism.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.760]   We're reaching the end
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.680]   of representative democratic government
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.200]   because representative democratic government
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.480]   cannot solve these social problems.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.520]   And capitalism as it has developed,
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.040]   Knight is very pro-capitalist,
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.280]   but he says it's generating inequality
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.120]   and this is putting too many strains on the system.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.080]   So Knight will become one of the people
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.440]   who helps Friedman think,
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.960]   how do I develop a new theory of capitalism
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.640]   that works in an era of mass democracy
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.160]   where people can vote
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.280]   and people can express at the ballot box
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.640]   their unhappiness with what's happening economically.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.800]   So this larger movement will generate
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.640]   of which F.A. Hayek is a part,
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.440]   Friedman is a part that becomes the very early stirrings
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.840]   of trying to think about a new sort of liberalism,
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.240]   which will eventually be called neoliberalism.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.480]   - Okay, so if we can just linger on definitions of things.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.400]   So we mentioned what neoclassical is
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.240]   and the institutional economics is.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.720]   What's Keynesian economics?
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.160]   And the Chicago School of Economics,
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.680]   I guess, is a branch of neoclassical
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.760]   that's a little bit more empirical
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.760]   versus maybe model-based.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.640]   And Keynesian is very model-heavy,
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.520]   more intervention of government.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.560]   - Yes.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.680]   - So the real battle is Keynesian versus everybody else.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.760]   - That is what eventually comes to pass in the United States
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.840]   and in the kind of overall developed,
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.200]   in the kind of developed profession of economics.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.480]   The other piece of the puzzle here
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.320]   is the introduction of mathematics.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.560]   And it's been around the edges,
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.560]   but it will pick up speed in the 1930s,
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.520]   like the Econometrics Society is founded.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.200]   They start publishing.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.400]   People start using more statistical and mathematical tools
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.360]   to think about economics,
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.360]   and they're given a boost sort of inadvertently
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.400]   by the rise of Keynesian economics.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.960]   So Keynes is trained in the neoclassical tradition.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.560]   He's an absolutely fascinating figure.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.720]   He's been there in the peace negotiations at Versailles.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.000]   He basically calls World War II.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.160]   He's like, "Hey, we're gonna have another war here
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.600]   caused by Germany because this peace treaty
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.280]   has been done in such a vindictive way,
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.840]   and people have made such bad decisions."
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.520]   He's there, he sees it happening.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.400]   And so when the Great Depression unfolds,
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.880]   he basically comes up with a new theory
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.720]   for explaining what's going on.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.240]   And the previous neoclassical understanding
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.080]   is sort of things go up and things go down.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.040]   And when they go down,
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.280]   there's a natural mechanism to bring them back up.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.920]   So when the economy's going down,
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.480]   prices are going down, wages are going down,
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.680]   everybody's losing money,
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.480]   but eventually firms are going to realize,
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.680]   "Hey, I can hire people cheap.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.680]   Hey, I can buy stuff cheap.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.880]   I don't have a lot of competition.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.360]   Maybe I should get in the game here."
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.600]   And then others will start to get in,
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.080]   and then you regenerate prosperity in that way.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.880]   And so Keynes says, "Sure, that's one theory,
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.240]   but something different is happening right now."
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.840]   Part of why it's happening
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:23.280]   is because the working class is more empowered now.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.760]   They're not simply going to just take low wages
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.960]   and ride them down to the floor.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.440]   We might not hit the floor.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:33.440]   But also he says people might become too anxious to spend.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.760]   They might not want to invest.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.840]   And Keynes has these discussions of animal spirits, right?
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.240]   He's still enough of a political economist
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.240]   to think not just in terms of human rationality,
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.520]   but what are some other things going on in human beings?
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.360]   And people might decide to sit on their money.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.960]   They might not invest it.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.920]   And so what happens then
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.520]   is you could get stuck in a bad equilibrium.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.080]   So in the neoclassical model,
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.840]   the equilibrium kind of restarts and resets itself.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.320]   And he says, "No, we could get stuck here.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.040]   We could get stuck in the depression."
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.520]   And in that case, what has to happen,
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.600]   he says the government stimulates investment
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.200]   and the government itself invests.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.280]   And then he argues that,
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.480]   this is a student of his, Richard Kahn says,
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.160]   "As the government invests a dollar,
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.880]   it has like a multiplier effect.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.240]   The dollar spent by the government
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.480]   kind of ramifies out throughout the economy."
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:30.480]   So it takes the government and puts it in the center
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.280]   as opposed to say the banking system or the financial system
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.280]   which would be the more Friedman analysis.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.320]   And for many economists of Friedman's generation,
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.440]   and he's a weird generation
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.360]   'cause the generation that becomes dominant
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.600]   is just like four years older
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.240]   the men who become Keynesian economics.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.920]   But that four years is really important
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.680]   because they come in to grad school in economics
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.600]   and they get exposed to the new ideas of John Maynard Keynes
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.400]   and they, I think it's Paul Samuelson calls it,
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   like it was like a South Sea virus
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.960]   that attacked all of the younger economists
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.840]   immediately succumbed and like no one under 50
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.120]   ever got the disease, right?
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.680]   'Cause their thinking's already set.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:15.680]   And so Keynesianism, Keynes himself is very suspicious
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.160]   of math and economics.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.280]   And he and Friedman is fascinating.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.000]   One of the first books by Anne Tingerman,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.880]   a Dutch economist to use math and economics
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.440]   is huge volumes.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.000]   Volume one, Keynes pans it.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.120]   Volume two, Friedman pans it.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.480]   So they're in the same page,
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.880]   but what happens is as Keynesianism
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.840]   arrives in the United States,
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.080]   Franklin Roosevelt is not really a Keynesian.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.280]   He's kind of an accidental or experimental Keynesian.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.520]   And there's a bunch of different ideas in the United States
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.720]   that are very similar to Keynesianism.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.640]   They're not theorized,
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.680]   but they're similar ideas
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.480]   that the government has to do something.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.880]   So this all comes together
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.120]   and American economists realize
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:05.120]   that you can construct models in the Keynesian perspective.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.160]   And if you can use numbers in these models,
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.760]   you can go to Washington DC with numbers
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:18.040]   and you seem like you have a lot more authority.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.040]   And so math becomes really twinned into Keynesian economics.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:29.080]   - So numbers are used as a kind of a symbol of expertise.
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.560]   We really know what the hell is going on
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.880]   because we have some numbers, right?
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.400]   - Right, and we can create a model.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.240]   And so we can say, okay, in the model,
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.520]   the interest rate is here and taxes are here.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.560]   So let's play with government spending.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.040]   Let's make it up, let's make it down.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.560]   And then we can get an estimation.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.400]   It'll spit out, here's predicted GDP.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.320]   So the other piece of the Keynesian revolution
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.960]   is it really gets people thinking kind of holistically
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.960]   about the economy as one conceptual unit.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.800]   And you then have what Paul Samuelson
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.080]   will end up calling the neoclassical synthesis.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.840]   And this is still in economics today.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.520]   If you take micro, you're gonna get supply and demand,
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.440]   scarcity, marginal analysis.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.800]   If you take macro,
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.520]   you're gonna get a very different approach
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.160]   and that's more Keynesian based.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.760]   And so the idea is that, and this makes sense.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.600]   I mean, you can think of this from statistics, right?
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.080]   The way things act individually
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.840]   versus when they're all added together
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:27.760]   can be very different.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.360]   So there's this kind of uneasy piece
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.640]   where economists are using kind of neoclassical tools
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.480]   to analyze individual behavior
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.760]   and individual market behavior.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.320]   And they're shifting to a different paradigm
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.080]   when they think about the economy as a whole.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.920]   And in this paradigm of the economy as a whole,
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.760]   the federal budget, the taxing and spending power
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.280]   of the federal government become paramount.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.640]   And that is called the fiscal revolution.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.360]   And that's really the essence of Keynesianism.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.960]   But the key thing to remember
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:01.240]   is that Keynesianism and Keynes are different.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.960]   And there's this famous episode
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.080]   where John Maynard Keynes comes to DC and he goes to dinner
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.400]   and he comes back and he says
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.520]   to one of his friends in London,
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.400]   he said, "Oh yeah, it was really interesting.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.960]   I was the only non-Keynesian there."
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.720]   - Yeah. - You know?
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.840]   - So Keynesianism is more government intervention,
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:21.760]   fiscal policy.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.840]   So put the government at the center
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.040]   of influencing the economy.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.520]   And then the different flavors
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.240]   of whether it's Austrian economics
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.080]   or Chicago School of Economics is saying no,
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.960]   we have to put less government intervention
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.880]   and trust the market more.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.320]   And the formulation of that from Milton Friedman
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.160]   is trust the money more, not trust,
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.520]   but the money supply is the thing
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.280]   that should be focused on.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.000]   - Yes, so the Austrians and the Chicago Schools
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.840]   see economic prosperity and growth
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.600]   comes from individual initiative,
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.280]   individual entrepreneurship, kind of private sources.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.520]   The private market is what drives economic growth,
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.440]   not the public sector.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.440]   And so for Friedman then the question is,
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.320]   what is the government's role?
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.320]   And because he's lived through the Great Depression,
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.920]   he's not laissez-faire and he won't ever be laissez-faire.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.080]   Now, interestingly, Hayek,
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.480]   living through the Great Depression,
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.640]   at first is laissez-faire.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.320]   And he's like, sure, like let it rip.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.160]   And things get so bad that Hayek's like,
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.600]   okay, that's not gonna work.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.080]   - Can we actually define laissez-faire?
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.040]   So what do we mean?
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.120]   Like, what's the free market?
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:37.960]   What's laissez-faire?
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.040]   What's the extreme version here?
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.560]   - So yeah, laissez-faire means leave a be in France.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:48.200]   It's more often used as an insult than as an actual.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.400]   Very few people are completely and totally laissez-faire.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.440]   That would be like the pure laissez-faire
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.720]   would be the sort of pure, maybe pure anarchist position,
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.360]   like the state does nothing or the state isn't even there.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.240]   But it tends to, if I could maybe make it more precise,
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.800]   it would be focused on freedom of contract
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.160]   would be essential.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:13.040]   And that means like the buyer of labor
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.320]   and the seller of labor must have absolute freedom
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.560]   to contract.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.440]   So that means no minimum wage law, no working hours law,
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.640]   no employment law, things like that.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.680]   That was, and this is all pre-progressive movement.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.160]   A lot of things are that way, right?
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.120]   You know, imagine you're in 19th century America
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:32.960]   and you have a farm
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.200]   and you hire someone to help you in the farm.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.720]   You offer the money, they take it.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.080]   If they fall off a ladder and break their back,
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.680]   maybe you help them out, maybe you don't, right?
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.600]   But there's not a whole apparatus of legal liability
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.200]   and safety and things like that.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.200]   So that would be one piece.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.960]   Another piece of laissez-faire
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:53.160]   would be free trade amongst nations.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:58.400]   So no regulation of who can invest in a nation
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.120]   or who can take money out of a nation.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.680]   So Nippon Steel could come and invest in U.S. Steel
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:08.040]   and there would be no grounds in which to reject that.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.600]   Or you could, as a billionaire in the United States,
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.320]   relocate you and all your money to another country
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.240]   and the United States couldn't try to keep you
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.560]   and nobody else could stop you from coming in.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:24.240]   And so, and then in the context of economic crisis,
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.480]   laissez-faire would not encompass
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.000]   centrally provided relief
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.480]   because in the pure theory,
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.600]   again, very seldom applied purely,
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.040]   but in the pure theory,
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:40.320]   the wages need to come down far enough
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:44.680]   and people need to be desperate enough to start taking work
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.680]   and to start the machine again.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.560]   So the theory would be if you give people relief,
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.360]   they might not go back to work.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.880]   Now, almost nobody says that in the Great Depression
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.240]   because the situation is so bad
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.480]   and it's, you know, people are starving on the street
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.760]   and people feel, for humanitarian and ethical reasons,
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.400]   it's not okay to say that.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.760]   The Austrians, though, at first, Hayek and Lionel Robbins
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.240]   are like, "This is a business cycle
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.840]   and it needs to run its course
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.560]   and it will be detrimental if we intervene."
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.960]   And then pretty soon, Hayek has to change his tune.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.200]   - So the Austrians are the most hardcore
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.320]   in terms of laissez-faire.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.880]   - Absolutely, and so Hayek will make the turn
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.120]   towards accepting more of a state
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.200]   and then will come to talk about how the state needs
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.360]   to support what he calls a competitive order.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:36.440]   But his mentor, Ludwig von Mises,
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:40.440]   still remains very hardcore and is not really open
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.920]   to things like unemployment insurance
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:46.320]   or other state-based interventions.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.360]   - What does von Mises say about, like, human suffering
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.640]   that's witnessed in the Great Depression, for example?
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.600]   Like, what are we supposed to, as economists,
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.840]   as humans that define policy,
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.360]   what are we supposed to see
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:01.600]   when people are, like, suffering at scale?
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.760]   - Yeah, I wish I knew an answer to that question.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.400]   I don't know enough about von Mises
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.800]   and his reaction in the Great Depression.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:13.800]   I think I would hazard that he would look more
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:18.320]   down the road and say, "Well, if you start here,
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.960]   you're gonna go places that are bad,"
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:25.080]   but I don't factually know what he said in response.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.120]   I do know that Hayek's position doesn't last very long.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.400]   It's not a position you can hold to.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.280]   Maybe you could hold to it in other cycles.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   The other thing that was interesting
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:40.120]   was I found very few Americans saying this.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.840]   Most who were were kind of small-town electeds,
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.000]   or the most famous is Andrew Mellon,
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.480]   quoted by Herbert Hoover, so not directly.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.360]   We don't have him on record saying this,
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.120]   but apparently Hoover records in his memoirs
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.600]   that Mellon said something like,
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:02.080]   "Liquidate real estate, liquidate stocks,
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.040]   purge the rottenness out of the system.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.680]   People will live a healthier life,"
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.960]   and certainly there were members of the Federal Reserve
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.920]   who felt like it would create,
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.160]   they didn't say moral hazard,
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.240]   but it would create what we now call moral hazard,
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.720]   bad habits, were we to intervene and to save failing banks
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.880]   because failing banks need to be taught a lesson.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.360]   They need to be taught discipline,
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.560]   and so a lot of people, I think,
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.720]   saw it in the context of discipline.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:32.200]   This is discipline, and if you remove the discipline,
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.840]   you'll be taking away something fundamental in society.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.880]   - So Milton Friedman never quite went
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.360]   all the way to laissez-faire.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.080]   - No, no, he didn't see that,
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.600]   and what's really interesting
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.840]   is the number of incredibly radical proposals
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.440]   that he and his teachers were floating,
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.380]   so I've mentioned Frank Knight.
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.240]   Another really important influence on Friedman
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.240]   was Henry Simons, who was a junior professor at Chicago,
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:02.240]   and Simons had this idea for what he called 100% money,
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.400]   which would be a law that says
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.800]   banks have to hold 100% of the deposits they receive.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.080]   They can't loan them out on the margin,
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.900]   so this would completely and totally
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.600]   have overhauled the U.S. banking system,
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.840]   and he would have said
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.460]   there's a category of things called banks
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.440]   where you get deposits,
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.480]   and then there's gonna be a category of sort of,
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.680]   he didn't say investment banks,
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.020]   but investment vehicles that will invest,
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.000]   so similar to what did happen in some ways
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.480]   in the banking reforms in the 1930s,
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.440]   the investment banks were split from the deposit banks,
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.080]   and the banks that took deposits
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.320]   were much more highly regulated,
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.000]   and they were supported by the FDIC,
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.520]   but the point being the Chicago school
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.400]   had these very radical proposals for reform.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:48.280]   Go off the gold standard, restrict the currency,
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:52.800]   change the banks, immediately relief payments now.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.360]   What is important to note, though,
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.020]   is that they thought of all of those as emergency measures
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.760]   to get through the emergency,
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:04.000]   not as permanent alterations in the state
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.080]   of what had to be,
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.480]   and not permanent alterations between state and market,
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.200]   where the Keynesian assumption is things have changed,
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.040]   times have changed, we're in a new dispensation,
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.000]   and we need a new relationship.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.560]   So Milton Friedman is very open
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.300]   to doing things differently in a state of emergency.
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:28.560]   He will have different ideas during World War II
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.580]   than any other time, and that's why I argue
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.880]   I think he would have been supportive
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.640]   of at least the first rounds of coronavirus relief,
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.000]   because I think he would have put
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.460]   his emergency thinking hat on.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.440]   So in that way, he was definitely more flexible.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:44.960]   - You mentioned Hayek.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.840]   Who is this guy?
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.400]   What's his relationship to Milton Friedman
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.120]   in the space of ideas,
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.440]   and in the context of the Great Depression?
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.040]   Can we talk about that a little bit?
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.920]   - Sure, so F.A. Hayek is an Austrian economist
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.760]   who takes up a posting in London,
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:06.760]   and he's a mentor, a mentee, rather, of Ludwig von Mises.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:10.800]   He's writing about business cycles,
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.260]   Austrian capital theory, and the Depression hits,
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:18.880]   and he's one of the few economists who, in the beginning,
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.280]   really is not calling for much intervention,
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:25.320]   although as he realizes how politically unpalatable that is,
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.280]   he will develop a more softened version
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.760]   of Austrian economics that has room
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.000]   for a whole range of social services.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.360]   What's significant about Hayek is that he is also watching
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.280]   what's happening in Austria, what's happening in Germany,
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:42.080]   and he's really worried the same thing is going to happen
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.640]   to the Western democracies,
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:47.160]   and he sees the root cause of this is socialism,
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.640]   the shift towards an expanded role for government,
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.720]   which we've been talking about
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.000]   is happening in the United States,
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   it's also happening in Britain,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.160]   and so he writes this book that becomes incredibly famous,
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:01.440]   "The Road to Serfdom," basically saying taking these steps
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:04.040]   towards a planned economy or an economy
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:07.960]   that's a modified form of capitalism is going to, could,
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:10.160]   he's very clear that this is not an inevitability,
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.960]   but if the same steps are taken
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:14.060]   and people follow the same line of thinking,
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:18.160]   we may end up in a sort of coercive, totalitarian state.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:22.080]   So this becomes enormously popular in the United States.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.200]   First of all, he's in good touch with Friedman's teachers,
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.040]   even before this book comes out.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.840]   They see them as kindred spirits.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.120]   Frank Knight is in touch with him,
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.040]   Henry Simons is in touch with him.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.600]   They all see themselves as liberals.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.160]   They call themselves old-fashioned, unreconstructed liberals,
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.240]   and so even before he becomes famous,
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:43.000]   Hayek will be trying to kind of organize thinkers
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   and intellectuals who he believes shares his values,
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.520]   of what we would call today classical liberalism,
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.920]   and to kind of create a counter consensus
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.600]   to the one that's gathering.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:58.440]   Now, Hayek also chooses not to argue against Keynes,
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.480]   and he feels that this is a huge missed opportunity,
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.200]   that he should have staked out the case against Keynes,
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.240]   and that because he did not,
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.880]   people come to believe there is no case against Keynes.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.000]   Keynes is literally unanswerable.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   So Hayek will have this great regret.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.840]   He will channel some of his regrets
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.120]   into sort of community building,
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.000]   specifically developing the Mont Pelerin Society,
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.240]   and it will fall to Friedman
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.280]   to really make that case against Keynes.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.680]   But Hayek will end up at Chicago,
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:33.480]   and Hayek really influences Friedman
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:37.280]   to think about what Hayek calls the competitive order,
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:41.400]   and how the state can and must
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.680]   maintain a competitive order.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:48.120]   That is the system of laws, of norms, of practices,
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:51.040]   that makes it possible for markets to function.
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.360]   And this is one of these key differentiators
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.880]   between the older philosophy of laissez-faire,
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.280]   and the newer reconceptualization of liberalism,
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.160]   which says, yes, we need a state.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.960]   We need a state that's not intervening in markets
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.800]   under social democratic auspices,
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.560]   but is structuring and supporting markets,
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.320]   so that they can function with maximum freedom,
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.720]   keeping in mind that if there aren't
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.040]   basic social supports needed,
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.920]   the market is apt to generate
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.640]   the type of either inequality or social instability
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.160]   that will call the whole system into question.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.400]   So Hayek is really key
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.360]   in promoting this modified liberalism.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.440]   But from being a very prominent economist
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.280]   in the 1920s and 1930s,
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:42.240]   as mathematics becomes the language of economics,
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.520]   Hayek is completely left out in the cold.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.880]   Now, Friedman, to some degree, is left out in the cold,
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.840]   but Friedman, at least,
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.680]   has proved to the mathematical economists
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.000]   that he knows what they're up to,
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.240]   and he's rejecting it
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.480]   from a position of expertise and knowledge.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.920]   And he literally drives the mathematical economists
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.800]   out of Chicago.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.120]   They're clustered in a group called the Kohl's Commission,
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.120]   and he makes their life hell.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.160]   They have to, they flee.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:10.040]   They flee the Friedman onslaught.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.680]   But then when Hayek arrives at the University of Chicago,
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.000]   he would like to be considered
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.840]   for a position in the economics department,
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.160]   and Milton Friedman says, "No way.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.480]   "You're not really an economist
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.200]   "because you're not empirical,
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.920]   "because you just develop these theories."
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.920]   So he has an appreciation for Hayek as a social thinker,
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.320]   but not as an economist.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.160]   So what Friedman decides to do,
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.800]   his answer to Keynes will be deeply empirical,
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.400]   but it will also be theoretical,
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.600]   and it will create an alternative intellectual world
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.360]   and approach for economists
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.160]   who aren't satisfied with Keynesianism.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.560]   And almost single-handedly,
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.640]   Friedman will introduce sort of political
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.040]   and ideological diversity into the field of economics,
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.600]   because from his beachhead in Chicago,
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.040]   he will develop the theory of monetarism.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.720]   So what is monetarism?
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.160]   The easy way to summarize it
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.080]   is this famous dictum of Milton Friedman's.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:14.440]   "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon."
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.040]   And it's fascinating that he becomes an expert in inflation
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.600]   because the first research,
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.320]   and the first major research product of monetarism
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.160]   is that theory of the Great Depression
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.720]   in a monetary history of the United States,
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.960]   and that is a theory of a deflation,
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.000]   all prices going down.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.200]   And he will go back to an idea
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.520]   that Irving Fisher had popularized,
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.880]   but a very old idea, almost a truism,
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.080]   the quantity theory of money,
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.240]   which says the level of the price level
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.640]   is related to the amount of money circulating in an economy.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.320]   So if you have more money, prices go up.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.640]   If you have less money, prices go down.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.640]   Now, this seems like very basic
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.880]   and almost too basic to bear repeating,
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.080]   but Friedman is saying this very basic relationship
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.120]   holds true even in an advanced industrial economy.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.640]   And that is what people have started to doubt.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.800]   And if you think about money, you think about banks,
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.600]   you don't think necessarily
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.800]   about the federal budget spending and taxation.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.000]   And what you see happens in American economics,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.480]   the textbooks previous to the Keynesian Revolution,
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.560]   they spent a lot of time on money.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.240]   They spent a lot of time on interest rates.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.680]   You can do word counts,
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.360]   and other scholars have done the word counts.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.880]   And then word count for money
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.200]   after World War II just plummets,
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.480]   and you start seeing things like taxation,
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.720]   budget, those things go up.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.440]   So what happens is the economics profession
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.560]   shifts its attention.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.760]   It just looks away from money to other things.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.400]   And Friedman is one of the few who's saying,
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.240]   "No, money still matters, money still counts."
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.520]   And it's a very counterintuitive argument to make.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.680]   It's a very historical argument to make.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.440]   And this is absolutely fascinating to me.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.880]   With Anna Schwartz, he develops this 150-year timeframe.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.840]   He also has students working on episodes of hyperinflation
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.120]   in different periods of time.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.320]   He's also looking back to ancient history,
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.200]   inflationary episodes there.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.960]   And he's saying this is a law of economics.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.960]   This is something that recurs throughout time.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.200]   It's not historical, right?
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.560]   It's not contingent.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.280]   It's a law of economics.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.840]   And his Keynesian counterpoints are saying,
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.920]   "No, that's not relevant any longer."
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.880]   Maybe once it was relevant, but it's not relevant today.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.200]   Now, in some ways, they have a point,
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.000]   because in order to pay for World War II,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.400]   the federal government sells a lot of bonds.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.440]   It issues a lot of debt.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:53.640]   And it wants to pay this debt back at a low interest rate,
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.080]   and it wants people to keep buying it.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.280]   It wants the low interest rate
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.360]   to be competitive with other interest rates.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.600]   So it wants, in general,
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.880]   low interest rates throughout the economy.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.680]   And the Federal Reserve has been so discredited
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.840]   by the Great Depression
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.280]   that the Treasury basically runs the Federal Reserve
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.560]   and says, "Keep interest rates low."
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.000]   And so that's what it's doing.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.280]   And so the Federal Reserve
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.240]   has stopped being an independent entity.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.120]   It's just a sub-department of the Treasury.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.920]   But in 1951, they negotiate
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.480]   what's called the Treasury-Fed Accord.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.040]   And the Federal Reserve gets its independence,
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.760]   but it doesn't really use it.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.320]   But statutorily, it now has it.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.280]   And so most economists are just observing
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.800]   a regime in which the Federal Reserve has no power,
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.280]   a regime in which there is really little inflation.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.560]   The inflation that is seen is post,
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.120]   just a little burst of inflation in the Korean War.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.480]   And they're saying inflation's not really important,
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.560]   it's not really relevant,
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.960]   and money's not really relevant and important.
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.800]   And so to break through and to make the argument,
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.880]   that's why Friedman and Schwartz go to history,
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.920]   and they're able to make that argument for history.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.240]   So then Friedman is coming out
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.520]   with a variety of papers that are saying,
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.120]   you know, when I look at economic fluctuations,
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.480]   he maps them side by side to fluctuations
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.960]   in the money supply and says, look, they fit.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.640]   And other economists, remember,
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.200]   they're building complicated mathematical models,
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.880]   and Friedman's doing extremely simple stuff.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.880]   And they just think it's dumb, it's not interesting,
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.960]   it's not true, they just, they don't buy it at all.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.040]   And so, but after a monetary history of the United States,
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.560]   they have to pay attention.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.360]   So it's really in those years,
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.480]   Friedman is hammering this idea of monetarism,
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:44.360]   and it starts to become something respectable,
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.040]   bordering on respectable for other economists
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.480]   to look to and think about.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.280]   And that's really the beginning
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.840]   of the kind of Keynesian monetarist split,
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.000]   where if you start to give Friedman any credence,
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.240]   you're heading towards a monetarist position.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.720]   Now, at the same time,
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.240]   Friedman comes out very publicly in 1964
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.760]   as a supporter of Barry Goldwater.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.040]   And Keynesian economics has found a home
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.960]   in the Democratic Party.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.280]   It's probably brightest moment in the sun,
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.360]   is the administration of John F. Kennedy,
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.520]   who brings in a lot of Harvard and Yale professors
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.160]   to the Council of Economic Advisors.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.800]   He proposes a series of spending programs
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.560]   that are really guided by the Keynesian philosophy.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:31.640]   And Barry Goldwater is tremendously controversial,
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.800]   part for his votes against civil rights,
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.120]   which Friedman really supports,
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.000]   part 'cause he's a hardcore libertarian,
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.080]   in an age when that's not in the political mainstream
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.400]   or not discussed in the political mainstream.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.440]   And I mean, he's just tremendously unpopular,
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.760]   particularly in all the educated precincts
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.600]   where Friedman lives.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.400]   So Friedman is like an outcast and a pariah
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.320]   for his support of Goldwater.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.920]   And so that actually really affects monetarism,
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.000]   because people feel that this is now becoming
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.560]   a package deal.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.520]   And so there's a great reluctance
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.360]   to embrace Friedman's ideas,
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.840]   because it seems like he would then have
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.480]   to embrace his politics.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:12.600]   - Ah, so it's associated with conservatism.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.920]   So this is the years when conservatism,
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.800]   there is a movement that calls itself conservatism,
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.520]   and Friedman is very tightly allied with this movement
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.680]   from the beginning,
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.320]   partly through his friendship with William F. Buckley.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.320]   And a lot of people say to me,
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.880]   "Yeah, but Friedman's not conservative."
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.640]   And this is like a bigger,
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.360]   we could have a whole separate podcast on this.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:36.960]   But for now, I'll just say that conservative
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.320]   in the United States becomes a political brand
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.280]   that contains elements of conservatism
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.000]   that are recognizable across time and space,
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.040]   embrace of tradition,
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.760]   more comfort with hierarchy, et cetera.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.160]   And it also has something new and different,
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.600]   which is Friedman's ideas
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.080]   about Milton Friedman's advocacy of more free markets,
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.440]   less government regulation,
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.920]   and the benefits of capitalism,
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.040]   and the benefits of freedom.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.120]   And that gets folded into American conservatism,
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.920]   in part because Milton Friedman
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.360]   is such a powerful intellectual figure.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.400]   And after his advocacy of Goldwater,
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.400]   media realizes this guy's really smart.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.840]   He has really interesting things to say.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:18.880]   He makes great copy.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.040]   He makes a great guest.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.400]   And he starts writing a column for Newsweek magazine,
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.840]   which is a very big deal
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.840]   in a much more consolidated media environment.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.440]   And he's quoted in all the newspapers.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.200]   And so his public profile really starts to rise
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.880]   right as he's pushing monetarism
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.920]   as an alternative to the Keynesian synthesis.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.800]   - Can we just linger on what is monetarism?
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.600]   - Yes, okay, I didn't come into it.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.080]   - So like what, okay, the money supply.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:47.920]   - Yes.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.440]   - So money is this thing that,
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.440]   you can think of it like a notion
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.600]   where people buy and sell stuff.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.800]   And there's this fascinating,
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.840]   complex, dynamical system of people
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.440]   contracting with each other in this beautiful way.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.960]   I mean, there's so many pothead questions
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.200]   I want to ask you about the nature of money.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.360]   I mean, money is fascinating in that way.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.560]   And I think for Milton Friedman,
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:18.960]   trusting the flow of money is really important.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.480]   And the signals that pricing and money in general provides
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.360]   is really important.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.400]   - So yeah, and some of this,
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.120]   I could take some of this back again to Frank Knight.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.000]   So one thing Frank Knight said to all his students
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   was the market is the best allocation mechanism we have.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.720]   The market is what allocates resources.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.640]   In a situation of scarcity,
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.960]   the market allocates them the best.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.560]   And Hayek will add to that by saying prices
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.640]   are information signals,
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.440]   and a price sends information to buyers and sellers
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.120]   about how they should act.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.720]   And these are the two of the strongest arguments
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.280]   for why the government should not intervene
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.920]   in the price system, because it will blur information
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.680]   or because it will allocate less efficiently
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.880]   than market allocation will.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.080]   And so what Friedman is really gonna add to that
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.400]   is maybe going up a level and thinking in the macro
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.360]   about the whole economy and how money circulates
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.640]   through that economy as a whole.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.440]   And so what he and Anna Schwartz do
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.680]   is they construct what are called monetary aggregates.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.160]   This is adding together, say, all the money
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.240]   that's on deposit in banks and all the money
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.840]   that's believed to be circulating in people's wallets.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:43.120]   And you also have to really go back in time.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.900]   We don't have credit cards.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.880]   There is a stock market, but it's tiny
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.440]   in terms of the number of people who invest.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.800]   There aren't mutual funds.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:56.080]   When traveler's checks are introduced,
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.960]   this is like a big deal.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.760]   So we have a very simple monetary system.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.480]   And so Schwartz and Milton Friedman start measuring
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.120]   what they call the monetary aggregates.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:11.120]   They focus on M1 and M2, and their favorite aggregate is M2,
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.940]   which I believe is encompassing sort of deposits
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:16.220]   and circulating medium.
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:19.800]   The other thing to recall, there's some fine distinctions
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:24.800]   between money in savings accounts
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.760]   and money in checkings accounts.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.920]   And money in savings accounts can earn interest
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.840]   and is generally believed not to circulate,
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.200]   where money in checking accounts
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.000]   does not at that time bear interest
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.520]   and cannot legally bear interest,
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.520]   and so is thought of as circulating.
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.800]   And then there's different institutional architectures
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.360]   of postal savings banks and credit unions.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.920]   But Friedman is, one, taking the focus
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.760]   to these aggregate amounts of money and saying,
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.960]   these really have a lot to do with economic booms and busts.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.680]   When we have an expansion in the amount of available money,
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.480]   we see an expansion in economic activity.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.880]   When we have a contraction in available money,
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.720]   we have a contraction.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.720]   And so he says, at this stage, the government,
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.320]   through the mechanism of the Federal Reserve
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.920]   and its influence on interest rates,
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.680]   can either make money more cheaply available
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.320]   and more freely available in the economy,
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.800]   or it can make money more expensive and slow things down.
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.760]   But the central core idea of monetarism
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.560]   is this is potentially very bad.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:42.360]   If the government can hit the gas and then hit the brake
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.040]   and hit the gas and hit the brake
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.480]   based on, say, what a politician wants
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.800]   or what somebody at the Federal Reserve wants,
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.440]   you have a lot of instability in the system.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.280]   And so one of the core policy proposals of monetarism
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.880]   is let's grow the money supply at a steady rate.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.040]   And in the beginning, Friedman just says K%.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.560]   He doesn't even put a number on it
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.480]   because he says the number doesn't matter.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.040]   What matters is the steadiness in the growth rate
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.400]   because if it's a steady growth rate, it will fade away,
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.200]   and then people will make economic decisions
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.200]   based on the fundamentals,
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.360]   not based on what they think is gonna happen,
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.360]   not based on hedging against inflation
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.520]   or hedging against deflation.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.400]   They'll just be able to function.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:37.200]   So this is sort of the paradox of monetary policy.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.440]   When it's happening right, you don't see it,
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.720]   you don't notice it.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.760]   When it's happening wrong, Friedman argues,
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.320]   it can just fundamentally destabilize everything.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.080]   It can cause a Great Depression,
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.040]   can cause an artificial boom.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.800]   And so he's taking monetary policy
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.400]   at a time when most economists think
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.560]   it's completely irrelevant
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.120]   and saying this is the central game of the economy.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.200]   Now, we live in a world where we believe this,
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.680]   and the Federal Reserve chair can't open their mouth
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.280]   without headlines being generated.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.080]   But Friedman is saying this at a time
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.200]   when the Federal Reserve
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.000]   is like a mysterious and secretive organization.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.880]   It's not well-known, it's not deeply appreciated.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.640]   Some of the only people who appreciate the Fed's power
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.640]   are like hardcore rural populists who have constituents,
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.600]   who think the banks and money power are the problem,
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.840]   who are like throwbacks from the frontier days.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.560]   So Friedman in the beginning has no constituency
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.920]   for this policy.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.240]   He has no constituency for this analysis.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.360]   And so just going back to summarize monetarism,
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:47.040]   it's looking, it's using the quantity theory of money
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.760]   to analyze the macroeconomy.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.040]   It's proposing a policy of slow and steady growth
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.760]   in the money supply.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.580]   And then it is arguing that inflationary episodes,
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:02.480]   when they emerge, are profoundly driven
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.880]   by changes in the money supply, not by anything else.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.760]   - I mean, and going even up a level as we started,
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.640]   how epic is it to develop this idea,
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.920]   to hold this idea, and then to convince the United States
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:24.760]   of this idea that money matters,
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:29.760]   that today we believe is mostly correct for now?
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.760]   - Yeah.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.360]   - And so just this idea that goes against the experts
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.040]   and then eventually wins out
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.320]   and drives so much of the economy,
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.000]   the biggest, the most powerful economy in the world.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:43.880]   So fascinating.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.240]   - Yeah, so I mean, that's a fascinating story.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.120]   And so what happens is Friedman
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.280]   has advanced all these ideas.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.120]   He's roiled the economics profession.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.680]   He's built a political profile.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.440]   And then he becomes the head
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.320]   of the American Economics Association.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.840]   And he is asked in that role to give a presidential address.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.280]   And so he gives this presidential address, December 1967.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:11.400]   And he says, "I'm gonna talk about inflation.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.200]   "And I'm gonna talk about the trade-off
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.560]   "between inflation and unemployment."
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.640]   And this is what's generally known as the Phillips Curve.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.880]   And the Phillips Curve in its original form
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.840]   is derived of post-World War II data.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.160]   So it's derived of about 12 years of data.
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.600]   And it shows that when inflation goes up,
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.680]   unemployment goes down.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.720]   And the idea would make sense
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.440]   that as the economy is heating up
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:39.880]   and lots of things are happening,
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.880]   more and more people are getting hired.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:45.480]   And so this relationship has led policymakers
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:49.000]   to think that sometimes inflation is good.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   And if you want to lower unemployment,
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.880]   you could let inflation kind of go a little bit.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.440]   And in the crude forms, it becomes to seem like a menu.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.560]   Like you could take your model and you could plug in,
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:05.120]   "I want this much unemployment."
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.040]   And it would say, "Well, great, this is how much inflation
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:07.880]   "you should do."
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.000]   And so then you would target that inflation rate.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.320]   So Friedman gets up and he says, "This is wrong.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.280]   "This might work in the short-term,
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.240]   "but it's not gonna work in the long-term
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.880]   "because in the long-term, inflation has,
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.800]   "first of all, it has a momentum of its own.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.080]   "Once it gets going, it tends to build on itself."
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:30.080]   The accelerationist thesis, it accelerates.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.000]   And once inflation gets going,
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.760]   and the reason it gets going is because
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.680]   workers go to the store
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.120]   and they see the price level has gone up.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.680]   Things have cost more.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.680]   They ask for the wages to go up.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:49.680]   Then people, eventually the wages will go up too high
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.560]   and they will no longer be hireable
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.400]   or companies will decide, "At these high wages,
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.560]   "I can't hire as many workers.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.800]   "I'd better lay off."
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.360]   So if inflation keeps going, eventually over the long-term,
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.840]   it will result in high unemployment.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.480]   So he says, "Theoretically,
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.840]   "you could end up in a situation
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:09.000]   "where you have high inflation and high unemployment."
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:09.840]   This hasn't been seen,
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.480]   but he says, "Theoretically, this could happen."
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.100]   And then he goes and he says,
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.760]   "And the government has started expanding the money supply.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.840]   "It started expanding the money supply in 1966.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.720]   "So we're gonna get a bunch of inflation
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.200]   "and then we're gonna get a bunch of unemployment."
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.120]   And he estimates about how long it will take.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.760]   And then he says, "Once this all happens,
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.300]   "it will take about 20 years to get back to normal."
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.440]   And-- - And he predicts
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.920]   the stagflation of the 1970s.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.560]   - Stagflation of the 1970s. - How gangster is that
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.080]   for an economist to do that?
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:45.480]   Again, against the mainstream belief
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.480]   represented by the Phillips Curve.
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:50.460]   - Yeah, and what really makes it happen
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:52.440]   is that many of the economists
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.500]   who most deeply dislike Friedman
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:58.200]   and most deeply dislike his politics in the 1970s
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.000]   as they're running their models,
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.600]   they start to say, "Friedman's right."
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:04.120]   They start to see in the data that he's right.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.980]   And a very parallel process happens in Britain.
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:08.720]   Britain is going through a very similar
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.940]   sort of burst of spending, burst of inflation.
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:14.720]   And so Friedman is vindicated in this very profound way,
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.200]   in the way that he himself said
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.500]   would be the ultimate vindication,
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.780]   which is my theory should predict.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:23.760]   So that prediction of stagflation
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:27.280]   is really the sort of final breakthrough of his ideas
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.400]   and also their importance to policy
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.800]   and to thinking about how we should intervene
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.700]   or not in the economy
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.360]   and what the role of the Federal Reserve is.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.800]   Because he's saying the Federal Reserve
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.640]   is incredibly powerful.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.800]   And finally, people start to believe him.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.300]   - And I don't know if we said, but to make clear,
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:50.480]   stagflation means high unemployment and high inflation,
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.960]   which is a thing, like you mentioned,
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   was not seen before and he predicted accurately.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.800]   And it also disproves the sort of the relationship,
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.920]   the inverse relationship
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:04.940]   between unemployment and inflation.
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:07.080]   - Yeah, now I should say the Phillips curve
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.380]   is still out there.
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:10.820]   It's been expectations augmented
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:14.960]   and it is relevant in the short term.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.000]   But Friedman's warning is still very much apt
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.500]   that if you get too focused on unemployment,
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.500]   you can let inflation out of the bag.
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:26.680]   And so until very recently,
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.160]   the Federal Reserve's tradition
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.020]   has been focusing on inflation,
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.440]   believing that's fundamental
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.760]   and that will keep unemployment low
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:37.100]   rather than trying to lower unemployment
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.400]   at the cost of raising inflation.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.720]   - Can we go back to Frank Knight
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.040]   and the big picture thing we started with,
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.220]   which is the justification of capitalism?
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:47.060]   - Yes.
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:48.760]   - So as you mentioned, Milton Friedman searched
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:51.560]   for a moral justification of capitalism.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:56.160]   Frank Knight was a big influence on Milton Friedman
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.400]   and including on this topic
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:01.680]   of understanding the moral justification of capitalism.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:05.120]   I think you spoke about Knight's case for capitalism
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.940]   was grounded in the idea that the ability to act
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:11.040]   in the face of uncertainty creates profit
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.200]   and it should because taking risks should be rewarded.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.000]   So like this idea that taking risks
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.880]   in the face of uncertainty should create profit.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.220]   And that becomes a justification,
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:25.640]   the ethics of capitalism.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.680]   Can you just speak to that?
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.960]   - Yeah, so Knight is talking about
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.600]   where does profit come from?
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.760]   And to his mind, it comes from the entrepreneurial function
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.720]   and the risk-taking function.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:39.280]   And so he kind of weaves that into why,
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:42.840]   you know, capitalism works best
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.540]   and why it's the most effective allocation machine
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:48.480]   and why it assigns responsibility
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.720]   in a way he believes that a socialist system never could.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:55.120]   Now, Knight though, is not a booster of capitalism.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.160]   It could be in part because he's just a darkly pessimistic
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.440]   kind of depressive guy.
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.160]   And so he's afraid that capitalism is gonna collapse
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:07.200]   and socialism or fascism is gonna take over or communism.
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:10.560]   And so he kind of descends into darkness there.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:14.720]   Friedman as the more optimist believes with Hayek
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.340]   that you can develop a different approach to capitalism
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:21.300]   that would preserve the price system, preserve allocation
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:24.500]   but build in social supports, build in a social minimum,
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.340]   things like this.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:27.080]   But there's a moment in his career
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.680]   where he's really struggling to figure out
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.580]   like how do I make this case for capitalism?
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:33.460]   And basically the whole sort of conservative movement
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.280]   or people who we later call the conservative movement
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.420]   are struggling to make this case.
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:41.580]   And he starts thinking about what makes capitalism work
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:44.540]   is that if you put forth effort, you get a reward.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.780]   So then you could say, well, people get what they deserve
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.280]   under capitalism, but then he kind of stops and he says,
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.480]   that's not really true
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.560]   because we're born with such different endowments
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.880]   and there's a huge quotient of luck, right?
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:57.560]   So some people are just in the right position
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.480]   and some people aren't.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.480]   So if I say capitalism is moral
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.840]   because people get what they deserve,
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.520]   that's not really true.
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.520]   And he also kind of has like an ethical reaction
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.840]   which he ends up calling like an aesthetic reaction.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:16.400]   He's kind of like, it just doesn't feel right to say that.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.300]   And so he struggles for a while with like, what do I say?
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:22.180]   And then he basically says, capitalism,
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.980]   it can't be the core.
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:26.420]   Discipline of the market can't be the core to your ethics.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:27.380]   It has to be something else.
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:29.700]   So that's when he will decide it's freedom.
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:31.240]   It's individual freedom.
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.940]   That's really the ethical core
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.820]   and capitalism makes individual freedom possible
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:38.780]   because capitalism is dedicated to maximizing that.
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:43.780]   And so the defense of capitalism comes through freedom
[01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:47.040]   and at his stage in history,
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.560]   he's able to set aside nice worry about inequality
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.380]   and say, when I look at the data,
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:55.140]   and this is true for the macro data at mid-century,
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:58.400]   incomes are actually converging, right?
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.120]   And it also, if you look historically,
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:04.320]   if a country goes from say a more feudal agrarian society
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.480]   to a more market-based society, incomes will converge.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.920]   Now then they might start to diverge,
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.040]   but Friedman's in the moment
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.920]   when he's seeing the convergence.
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.100]   And so that's what he's really focused on.
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:17.320]   So he believes he can justify capitalism
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.000]   through the ethic of freedom.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.040]   And he also believes that inequality
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.980]   is a problem that can be addressed through specific policies.
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:28.480]   And it's not a fundamental feature of capitalism.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.200]   In other words, he doesn't see capitalism
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.360]   as an engine of inequality, the way that Frank Knight did
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.240]   and the way that maybe some critics on the left would.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.760]   - How did he conceive of freedom?
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:43.080]   So individual freedom, economic freedom, political freedom,
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.980]   civil freedom, what was the tension,
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:47.780]   the dynamic between those different freedoms for him?
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:50.860]   - So he really begins focusing on economic freedom.
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.080]   And he says it's really important
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.320]   to focus on economic freedom
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.660]   because in the United States, we don't value it enough.
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:00.560]   So by economic freedom, he means the ability
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.620]   to keep what you've earned,
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:06.720]   the ability to make decisions about your business,
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:09.020]   the ability to make decisions about the work that you do.
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.700]   So this will translate into things like
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.300]   there shouldn't be a minimum wage.
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:15.620]   He believes the minimum wage has bad social effects,
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:18.380]   but he also believes you should be free to accept a job
[01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:20.660]   at a wage that you yourself have determined
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:21.860]   is acceptable to you.
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:26.680]   And there should be very minimal regulation,
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.500]   questions around safety and other things,
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.040]   because the market will ultimately,
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.720]   if you create an unsafe product, it won't sell.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.180]   And that will be, that's sort of your incentive.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.360]   So he really centers economic freedom
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.780]   because he thinks especially,
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:42.020]   and he's really speaking from his vantage point
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.460]   in the universities and speaking
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:46.460]   to the kind of liberal consensus of the '50s and '60s,
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:49.060]   he thinks economic freedom has been undervalued
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:50.040]   in the American context.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.060]   So he really wants to push that forward.
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:55.100]   He's really kind of taking political freedom for granted.
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:57.140]   Now, later in his career, when he becomes famous,
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:00.740]   he's traveling the world, he spends time in Chile.
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:04.220]   And this country is now being ruled by a dictator,
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:07.700]   Augusto Pinochet, who starts introducing economic freedom,
[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:09.540]   but there's no political freedom.
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:11.340]   And Milton Friedman believes eventually
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:12.940]   these two things are gonna go together,
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:16.380]   and tells Pinochet, you've got economic freedom,
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:17.740]   and eventually it's gonna bring,
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:19.620]   it's gonna mean political freedom.
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:21.720]   Pinochet's like, okay, fine, not really interested in that.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.300]   I wanna know what I should do about inflation.
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.380]   (laughing)
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.420]   But then when Milton Friedman leaves Chile,
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:30.900]   he is attacked and vilified for having been a supporter.
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:33.820]   He's interpreted that he's a supporter of the regime,
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:35.500]   which he's not, but he realizes
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.660]   he has talked too much about economic freedom,
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:39.500]   and he hasn't talked enough about political freedom.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.580]   He's kind of assumed political freedom,
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:43.780]   'cause he's come from the American context.
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:46.780]   So then he starts recalibrating them and saying,
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:48.820]   you know what, if you don't have political freedom,
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:51.460]   you're never gonna be able to hold on to economic freedom.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:54.020]   So he sees that they need to go together,
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.860]   and they don't naturally go together,
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:58.540]   and so he starts to become more clear
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:01.240]   in talking about political freedom.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.500]   Now, let's fast forward to the end of his life,
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.900]   and he's witnessing the emergence
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:07.260]   of what we call the Asian tiger.
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:11.780]   So, capitalist economies that are doing very well,
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:14.180]   but they don't have political freedom,
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:16.800]   but then he observes they don't have political freedom
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:20.180]   in that you can't vote in a free and fair election,
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:23.620]   but they also don't have a Stasi, they don't have a KGB,
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:27.460]   they're not hauling people off for their wrong opinions.
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:30.700]   So then he says they have something called civic freedom,
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.660]   and so he kind of defines this third sphere,
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:35.980]   civic freedom of debate, discussion,
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:38.300]   interpersonal relations, but you can't be political.
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:42.380]   So, this is a late in life addition,
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.100]   I don't think it's fully theorized,
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:47.140]   I think what it shows is that during the Cold War,
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:50.260]   he very much believed economic and political freedom,
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:54.340]   you know, capitalism and freedom, democracy,
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:57.380]   the United States, capitalism, this all went together.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:58.980]   And he starts to see at the end of his life,
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:00.700]   the emergence of different social systems
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:03.300]   that are using market trading and allocation,
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:05.860]   but aren't giving people similar freedoms,
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:07.540]   and he's kind of puzzling over that.
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:11.020]   Now, he always believes that China will democratize,
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:14.220]   and he thinks China's on the path to democratization,
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:16.820]   in part because Chile does democratize.
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:19.220]   Eventually, Pinochet is voted out,
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.700]   and it's become a democratic capitalist
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:22.900]   and very prosperous country.
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:24.920]   And he thinks that's exactly what's happening in China,
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.400]   he sees Tiananmen, and he doesn't live long enough
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.660]   to get to where we are now,
[01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:32.980]   in which doesn't look like political or civic freedom
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:34.940]   is coming to China anytime soon.
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:38.420]   - And he did oppose the dual-track system of China,
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:41.220]   meaning like the market is bottom-up,
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:45.060]   the government in China is top-down,
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.860]   and you can't have both.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.380]   - He thought you couldn't have both.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:49.220]   - Yeah.
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:51.640]   - He thought eventually the market would triumph.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.820]   - Well, that's a really powerful idea to say,
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.060]   okay, maybe there's not political freedom,
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:58.220]   but just hold on to the economic freedom,
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:01.780]   and eventually that's going to give political freedom.
[01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:03.860]   Is that correct to say, like,
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:06.580]   start to work on the economic freedom,
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:09.220]   and the political freedom piece will take care of itself?
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.340]   - That's what he believed, that's what he believed.
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:14.620]   Yeah, I think it's more complicated than that, right?
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:18.140]   The people who gain out of a system of economic freedom
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:20.620]   could decide to collude in a system
[01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:23.180]   where there isn't political freedom.
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:24.580]   That's certainly a scenario.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:28.540]   So, but that was, again, that's that core idea of freedom,
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:32.220]   right, and that core belief that people want freedom,
[01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:34.700]   and that people are drawn to freedom.
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.740]   - Just to go back to Frank Knight a little bit,
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:39.620]   he wrote an essay called "The Ethics of Competition."
[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:42.220]   He had the metaphor that economic life is a game,
[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:44.380]   and then maybe that extends to society as a whole,
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:47.220]   like the entirety of it is a competitive game.
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:52.220]   And Milton Friedman, I think, adapted some of this,
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:53.980]   appreciated some of this.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:55.260]   Can you speak to this metaphor?
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:57.980]   - Yeah, I think what the metaphor of the game does
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:01.580]   is it asks you, okay, well, what are the rules then?
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:05.580]   And let's focus on the rules that keep the game going.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.780]   So he didn't use the concept of an infinite game,
[01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:09.220]   but I think that's an interesting one.
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:11.100]   You know, a game that all the players are in
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:13.340]   and keep going again and again and again.
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:17.740]   And so that helped Knight, along with Hayek,
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:22.740]   shift from the allocation question, who's getting what?
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.620]   Are things allocated fairly?
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:26.980]   To the more structural question of like,
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.100]   what are the rules of the game that we need
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.460]   to keep this system going?
[01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:34.260]   And so for a while that led to the discussion of monopoly.
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.820]   Well, we need rules against concentration,
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:40.340]   or we need the rule of law.
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:42.580]   Everyone needs to be treated equally.
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:46.900]   People need to know what they're up against.
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:49.660]   And then going back to monetarism,
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:52.380]   the core of monetarism is a rule.
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:55.260]   Friedman called it a monetary growth rule.
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:59.420]   And so again, what keeps the economic game going
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:03.100]   is a rule about how much the money grows
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:04.500]   that everybody knows.
[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:07.700]   Nobody's guessing, nobody's changing the rules
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.460]   to help their side or to help, you know,
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:11.140]   the people they're friendly with.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.500]   We all know it's there, it's clear, it's easy.
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.820]   And so that emphasis on rules,
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:18.420]   I think really has a through line.
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:20.660]   It goes into Hayek's competitive order,
[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:23.340]   and then it goes into the monetary growth rule.
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:25.660]   And then, you know, today,
[01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:30.980]   monetary policy makes use of monetary policy rules.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:33.300]   We have not abandoned discretion,
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:35.940]   but rules are used as a heuristic or a check,
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:38.500]   and those come out of Friedman's thinking.
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:43.500]   And so it's something, it's really profound,
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:47.180]   and it was always counterposed to discretion,
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:50.620]   which Friedman worried would be subject to capture
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:52.020]   or political corruption
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:53.820]   if you had discretion in policymaking,
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:56.480]   or if you had discretion in these very big areas.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:00.060]   Then people would stop competing
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:01.580]   against each other in a market,
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:03.780]   and they would turn their attention
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:07.820]   to getting control of the rules or the rule makers.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:10.220]   - So if there's clear, transparent rules,
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:13.580]   then you're free to play the game.
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:15.300]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.300]   - But then, depending on the rules,
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:18.740]   the game can turn out,
[01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:21.500]   the equilibrium that it arrives at might be different, right?
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:24.820]   So that speaks to the mechanism design,
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:26.740]   the design of the rules.
[01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:28.340]   - Yeah, and that was, again,
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:32.340]   to go back to the idea of separating new liberalism
[01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.380]   or neoliberalism from classical liberalism
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:37.260]   was more of a focus on what are the rules that are needed?
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:40.540]   What is the competitive order that we wanna set out?
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.880]   How do we design in social safeguards?
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.960]   How do we think about it?
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:49.140]   And so that shift towards monetary policy
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:51.160]   and focusing on stable monetary growth,
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:54.580]   that becomes really important in the post '70s era
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.300]   as one of the basic rules
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.500]   of how a capitalist economy should function.
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.740]   And it becomes really important
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:02.860]   because they see the example of, say,
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:05.220]   countries, most notably in Latin America,
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:07.960]   where monetary rules weren't followed
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.380]   and different governments played politics
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.740]   with their currencies.
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:15.340]   And that created just huge upheaval
[01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:18.540]   and huge social loss, economic loss,
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:20.500]   just economic disaster.
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.940]   - So my friend, she's a poker player,
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:24.920]   philosopher of sorts, great human being.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:27.500]   She has a podcast called "Win Win"
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:28.880]   that everybody should listen to.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.960]   And the whole purpose of the podcast
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:33.180]   and her whole way of being in spirit
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:34.860]   is to find win-win solutions.
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:37.380]   So do you think of economic life
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:40.740]   as having such win-win solutions?
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:44.460]   So being able to find rules where everybody wins,
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:47.100]   or is it always going to be zero-sum?
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:49.860]   - I definitely believe in win-win,
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:51.340]   but with a big asterisk.
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:53.700]   Like, you can have win-win,
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:56.060]   but it can feel like win-lose,
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:35:00.400]   which is it's not just, are people getting more?
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.500]   It has a lot to do with,
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.600]   do people feel they're getting more?
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:06.440]   And do people feel they're getting what's fair and equal?
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:09.960]   So you could have a situation,
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.940]   you know, for instance,
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:15.460]   if you look at the history of, going back to Chile,
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:19.540]   it has steady growth, steady income growth,
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.060]   steady diminution of inequality,
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:25.020]   and a high level of discontent within the society,
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:26.620]   and a high level of belief
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:29.940]   that the society is corrupt and unfair.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:31.540]   And that's what matters.
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:35.420]   How people feel about it, how people perceive it matters.
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:37.940]   And you can't, you know, we saw this recently,
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:40.240]   you can't just come out with a bunch of statistics
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.100]   and tell people you're winning in this game
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:44.820]   if they feel like they're losing.
[01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:47.920]   So that goes to all the non-rational factors
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.980]   and all the comparative factors that people have
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:54.300]   when they think about where they are
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.300]   vis-a-vis other people in society.
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.100]   So we're just incredibly social creatures.
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:01.060]   We're incredibly attuned to our status,
[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:04.300]   to rising and falling, to where we sit vis-a-vis others.
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:07.160]   And so that absolutely has to be attended to.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.620]   It can't just be an economic analysis.
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:12.780]   - That's so interesting that the experience
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:15.900]   of the economy is different than the reality of the economy.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:18.520]   You know, on the topic of corruption,
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:20.080]   I think the reality of corruption
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:23.400]   versus the perception of corruption
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.280]   is really important in a lot of these nations.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.600]   You take Ukraine, for example.
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.400]   The perception of corruption
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.480]   has a big impact on the economy.
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:32.480]   You don't want to invest,
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.840]   you're very cautious as a business person.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.720]   The reality of corruption can be way different
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:38.200]   than the actual perception.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.360]   But if narratives take hold,
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:44.000]   it's a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.600]   that it has a big effect on the psychology
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.700]   of the people involved.
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.540]   It's interesting.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:51.500]   - Yeah, I mean, this goes back to Keynes' analysis
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:52.960]   of the Great Depression, right?
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.920]   If people won't invest, if they're spooked,
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:57.860]   if the investing classes are spooked,
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:59.980]   you could be in real trouble.
[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:03.860]   And in some ways, this simple analysis of the problem
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:08.060]   and proposal of a solution was enough to restore
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:11.620]   eventually the path to academic prosperity, right?
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:12.940]   That's Franklin Roosevelt.
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.660]   Nothing to fear, but fear itself.
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:17.000]   You know, the sense of we know we have a future,
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.920]   we have optimism, then you believe in it.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:21.880]   And to go back to thinking about money, right?
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.300]   Money works because we all believe in it.
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.580]   You know, it's a form of social trust,
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:30.100]   and it's a form of belief and faith in our society
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:31.780]   and in the other people in it.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:32.980]   And when that breaks down,
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.620]   the money system will break down as well.
[01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:37.220]   - Is there something Milton Friedman said
[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:40.200]   and thought about how to control the psychology
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.680]   of humans at scale?
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.620]   - No, I mean, what's interesting is he does talk,
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:47.660]   especially in his later work,
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:52.500]   he says we have fiat currency, and this is an experiment,
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:55.380]   you know, and we don't know how it's going to turn out.
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.000]   And it's turning out okay right now,
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.340]   but we've always had a commodity-based
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.980]   or backed currency of some form or another.
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:04.940]   And this is the first time.
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:07.380]   And so, who really knows?
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:09.340]   So far, so good.
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:11.240]   And he also is very attuned.
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:12.720]   It's interesting in his later writings
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.680]   when he's thinking about this to,
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.340]   sure, I could design a monetary system
[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.180]   that would be different,
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:20.140]   but when I look at history,
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:22.780]   I see that monetary systems have always, say,
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:25.120]   incorporated the role of the state
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.660]   because it's so important to people.
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:29.500]   And so, therefore, my theoretical designs
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:30.580]   really have to be tempered
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.380]   by what I've actually seen happen in history.
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:36.680]   - So maybe we could speak to this tension
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:40.060]   between how much government intervention is okay
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:41.020]   for Milton Friedman.
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:42.900]   So he was against minimum wage,
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.700]   but he was for guaranteed minimum income.
[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:48.100]   Can you explain, actually, the difference between the two?
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:50.560]   - Yeah, so this was one of the discoveries
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:51.500]   I made in my research.
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.380]   I found a paper from 1938.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.820]   He wrote advocating what we would call today
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:58.700]   a universal basic income, a minimum income.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:01.420]   And he basically sees this as part of the effort
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:04.220]   to create a new liberalism, right?
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:07.260]   And he basically says we have advanced societies,
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:09.500]   we have prosperous societies,
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:12.900]   we have decided, in keeping with our morals and our ethics,
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:15.020]   that people should not be starving
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:16.780]   in an advanced society like this.
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:19.500]   The question is how are we gonna make that happen?
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:22.180]   And he ended up believing the best thing to do
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:24.920]   was to put a floor under everybody.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.740]   And he said you can get that based on your income.
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:31.080]   If you have a lot of income, you don't get it.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.600]   If you have a little income,
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:33.640]   you might get a little bit of it.
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:36.380]   If you have no income, you get enough of it.
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:37.940]   And he believed in the beginning,
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:41.660]   you should base that on what was required to buy food, right?
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:43.140]   That that would be kind of an objective.
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:45.500]   You could objectively determine the nutrition
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:46.980]   and the price of food.
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:49.700]   And so that for him, it's important.
[01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:52.040]   He says it's keeping with a liberal polity
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.180]   because it's not intervening in the price system.
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:58.100]   It's not intervening in economic relations.
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:00.260]   And it does not, in his view,
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.780]   require a bureaucracy to administer.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:06.700]   It does not, in his view, require that you qualify for it
[01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:09.500]   by virtue of being in a protected class.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:13.560]   You just get it as kind of part of your membership
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.540]   in this general citizenship body.
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:20.500]   And so that to him was really different than a minimum wage
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:24.960]   because it did not interfere with the work bargain.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.740]   His belief about minimum wages was specifically
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.700]   that it priced out unskilled labor.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:32.860]   That what an unskilled laborer had to offer
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:35.640]   was a willingness to work for a very low wage.
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:38.660]   And if you set the minimum wage too high,
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:42.700]   businesses, instead of hiring that higher-priced labor,
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:43.540]   would not hire.
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:45.740]   Or like we could think of today, right?
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.660]   They put in an electronic checkout, you know,
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:48.600]   or something like this,
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.300]   where you don't actually need the labor.
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.220]   So he really believed the minimum wage
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.380]   had that perverse incentive.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:56.780]   Now there's, this is a live debate
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:58.540]   on what minimum wages do.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:01.260]   And there seems to be a level at which you can set them
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:04.100]   that they can not have that perverse effect,
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:06.240]   and in fact can kind of create people
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:08.540]   with more spending money that then powers the economy.
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:12.880]   So he had a very sort of clinical analysis of that
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.360]   rather than an empirical one or a really abstract analysis.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:19.680]   But the minimum income is fascinating
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:22.240]   because it seems very leftist to us.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:26.060]   But what it is, is it's purely individualistic.
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:28.000]   And it never really happened
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.080]   because it was so purely individualistic
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:35.340]   because American social policy typically identifies,
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:37.480]   like this group of people is deserving
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.600]   and we'll give them benefits.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:41.480]   So the classic example is soldiers, veterans.
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:45.480]   Another example is mothers raising dependent children.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.880]   These people deserve money.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:49.320]   The rest of you, you better go out and work.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:52.400]   And so Friedman's proposal, it really caught on in the '60s.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.480]   It ultimately went nowhere, but it was no litmus test,
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:42:00.920]   no income analysis, just we're gonna give you this much.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.440]   Everyone's gonna get this much.
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.920]   And he decided once mass taxation had come in,
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.640]   you could do it through taxes and you could just rebate.
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:10.800]   People who didn't pay income taxes got a rebate.
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:11.840]   That actually came to pass.
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.520]   It's the earned income tax credit.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:17.400]   And it's considered extremely successful by policy analysts.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.680]   It does what it's supposed to do.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:20.280]   It's not that expensive.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:24.700]   And so I see that as a kind of paradigm of his thinking
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:28.560]   in that instead of creating a bureaucracy
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:30.520]   that does some form of redistribution
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:34.480]   or instead of trying to intervene in the market for labor
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:37.600]   or the market for something else, the market for housing,
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:41.980]   you provide a cash grant that people spend for themselves.
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.880]   And so interestingly, that's what happened
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.080]   in the emergency situation of COVID, right?
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.480]   That's exactly what people did.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.480]   They followed that model.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.400]   We just get money out quick.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:54.640]   And there's a lot of discussion still about UBIs
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.380]   as something that should be done.
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:59.080]   And I think it's always gonna be hard to pull off
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:02.120]   because I think Americans
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:04.080]   and their elected representatives
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:06.000]   don't wanna provide a universal benefit.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.600]   They wanna provide a targeted benefit
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.760]   'cause they believe there's like a moral component here.
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:15.340]   And Friedman advanced a policy that was really abstract
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:19.520]   and really just kind of, it was devoid of judgment.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:21.180]   It was like pure and beautiful in that way,
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:23.080]   but like utterly impractical.
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:26.720]   - And it really focused on not interfering with the market
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.840]   and the signals that the market provides.
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:30.840]   Like it was really against price controls
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:32.080]   for the same kind of reason.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:33.360]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.760]   Or you could say, okay,
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:37.080]   but how does this not interfere with the market, right?
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:38.800]   If you provide people with a minimum income,
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.960]   won't that change their incentives to work, et cetera?
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:44.460]   I mean, there's a big body of research on this.
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:47.720]   Most of it seems to show one,
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:50.640]   it's way better than the current benefits cliff
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:54.140]   where you have to not work to get your benefits.
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:57.600]   And any incentive impact on working
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.040]   seems to be much lower than would be expected.
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.520]   But I'll let the economist in the social science
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:06.600]   to fight that one out and figure it out empirically.
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:07.960]   Hopefully we should be able to.
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:09.440]   - Yeah, there's been a bunch of studies.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.880]   It's interesting, even just how you conduct studies
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:14.240]   like this, how you do these kinds of experiments,
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:17.760]   especially if you're empirically minded.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:21.760]   'Cause a lot of the studies I saw is they're pretty small.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:22.600]   - Right.
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:25.360]   - So how do you make big conclusions
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:28.400]   about how to run the world,
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:31.760]   how to run economies from such small studies?
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:35.840]   It's all a fascinating experiment of ideas.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:39.400]   And it's also inspiring to see individuals
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:43.120]   and maybe small groups of individuals
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.680]   like the Chicago School of Economics
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:49.160]   to sort of shake up what we believe
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.160]   in how we run the world.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.120]   - Yeah. - Inspiring.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.360]   - Yeah.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.120]   - You call Milton Friedman the last great conservative,
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:02.080]   maybe to be a little bit sort of controversial
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:05.340]   and make bold statements that get everybody excited.
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.880]   But what do you mean by that
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:09.280]   and what makes a great conservative?
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:11.320]   - So I was really thinking of that
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:14.520]   in terms of kind of American political identities
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:18.280]   and particularly the 20th century conservative movement,
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:21.440]   which people are always saying this isn't conservatism.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.640]   And I was like, yes, in America,
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:23.960]   conservatism is different.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.320]   It looks different.
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.280]   It feels different.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:29.600]   Conservatism in America builds in a big component
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.000]   of what we could call libertarianism, pro-capitalism,
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.600]   anti-government ideas.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.240]   And critics will say,
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:40.800]   but conservatism is about conserving institutions
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.280]   and practices, and it has a role for the state
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.920]   and an organic community.
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:45.840]   But in the United States,
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.120]   it's always had since the 20th century,
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:53.480]   also this anti-statist, let's let the market rip.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:56.240]   Let's not worry about what the market does
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.640]   to establish traditions.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:58.800]   The market is our tradition.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.580]   Capitalism is our tradition.
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:02.540]   So that was really synthesized.
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:04.880]   Many people were there,
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:07.280]   but Friedman and the importance of his books,
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:11.600]   Free to Choose, Capitalism and Freedom,
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.480]   the television series he did,
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:15.720]   all of these were like core components
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:19.240]   of this American conservative synthesis as it evolved.
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.280]   And I really see that as having broken down.
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:25.720]   It is scattered into different pieces
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.560]   and we don't know where they're gonna
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.480]   come back together again.
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:34.480]   But Friedman's push for open global markets,
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:35.880]   unfettered free trade,
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.520]   it's getting pushback on both the left and the right.
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:42.640]   That I think is just a major sign
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:45.080]   that both parties have turned away from this vision.
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:47.720]   I don't know what they've turned to,
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:50.760]   but the way that Friedman brought these pieces together,
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:52.600]   I think that political moment is past.
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:54.800]   So that's what I was trying to talk about
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.960]   with the book title.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:57.840]   There's another way though,
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:00.320]   in which I think of him also as a conservative,
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:03.680]   which is that within the field of economics,
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:05.360]   he went back to this older idea,
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.400]   the quantity theory of money and said,
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:09.520]   this still has value.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.640]   This can be applied in the modern day.
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:13.400]   It is something to teach us.
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:16.480]   And he pushed back against this trend
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.880]   towards mathematization.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.520]   So he kept writing books.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.320]   You can still pick up a Friedman book and read it.
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:24.880]   Where's lots of economics articles and outputs,
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.880]   like unreadable unless you're in the field.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.280]   And so I think in that way,
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:31.840]   he was trying to conserve methodologically
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.040]   and intellectually the traditions of the field.
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:38.320]   The work that he and particularly Anna Schwartz did
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.560]   that literal accounting of things
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:43.440]   and deep analysis of data from the field,
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.720]   that was like completely unfashionable in his time.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:47.080]   Now we've sort of gone back to it
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.000]   with big data and with computers,
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.960]   but he helped bring that forward
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:52.080]   and preserve that tradition.
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:56.000]   So I think of him kind of intellectually as a conservative,
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.160]   if you think of the mode of his thought.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.120]   And so, I mean, what makes a great conservative
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.200]   is one who takes those older ideas
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:05.880]   and makes them fresh for a new time period.
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:09.760]   I think that's exactly what he did.
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:11.400]   - You've also spoken about the fact
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:15.760]   that the times when he was sort of out in public,
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.240]   there was more of an open battle of ideas
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:23.240]   where conservatism often had, you know,
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:26.960]   William F. Buckley, he had a more vibrant,
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:35.120]   deep debate over ideas where it seems less deep now.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:38.840]   - I mean, that is the thing that it's hard,
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:41.320]   especially like for the students I teach today
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:44.200]   to be like, you know, there were arguments about ideas
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:46.640]   and conservatives won a bunch of them, you know?
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.320]   And that happened in the '70s, late 1960s to 1970s,
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:53.120]   when they, you know, one set of arguments
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:55.360]   was about economics, like, okay,
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.960]   this idea of stimulating the economy by spending more,
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.040]   it has a downside.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.680]   The downside's called inflation.
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:05.320]   And the downside's called too much regulation.
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:09.360]   And, you know, you've gone too far in kind of bottling up
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.400]   the actual sources of economic growth and dynamism,
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:14.000]   and we have to let those free.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.480]   In social policy, there was also a critique.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:20.440]   You know, the Great Society had all these ways of,
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.240]   ideas of ending poverty, and, you know,
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:24.360]   people came and analyzed them and said,
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.880]   the programs aren't helping.
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.040]   In some ways, you've actually created engines
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.320]   to trap people in poverty
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.400]   because you've given them a benefit
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:32.920]   and said if they actually start to work,
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.160]   they lose the benefit.
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.840]   You've created all these perverse incentives.
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:38.240]   And these ideas were fought out.
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:39.840]   They were empirical.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.400]   They were controversial.
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:43.840]   And they were based on really deep research
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.320]   and really deep argumentation.
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:49.760]   And so, it seems that era has passed.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:53.680]   It seems like we're driven much more quickly
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:57.840]   by moods rather than thought through ideas.
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:02.000]   Right now, it seems like the ideas come after the,
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.640]   they follow the political mood
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:06.720]   and try to put together the underpinning of it,
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.400]   where it really was the opposite
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.880]   for much of the 20th century.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:12.960]   It does seem like we lead with emotional turmoil.
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:13.800]   Right.
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:16.760]   And the ideas follow versus lead with the ideas
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:20.080]   and the sort of the emotion of the masses respond.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:20.920]   Right, exactly.
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.920]   So, if we think of the evolution of conservatism,
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:27.400]   it was a whole set of ideas that was crafted, refined.
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.280]   The 1950s, 1960s, 1970s,
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:33.600]   sort of really found their emotional standard bearer,
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:37.440]   translator, salesperson in Ronald Reagan,
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.840]   who incidentally had been following these ideas
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:42.560]   as they developed and had been honing his ability
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:45.040]   to express them and apply them politically.
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:46.640]   You know, it's a very opposite.
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:50.120]   If we look at Trump as the political definer of the era,
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:51.760]   you know, there's a set of ideas,
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:56.240]   but it was more attitudes, impulses, vibes,
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.360]   and the ideas are coming after that,
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.600]   trying to figure out how they patch on.
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:05.480]   So, it's interesting to watch, to see that difference,
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:08.600]   and I hazard that a lot of it just has to do
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:11.160]   with the immediacy of the media environment we're in,
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:14.400]   and it's just power of the media messages
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.960]   to get out so fast.
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:18.680]   What do you think Milton Friedman would say
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:23.680]   about Donald Trump, about him winning in 2024,
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:28.120]   and just in general, this political moment?
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:29.800]   I think he would love Doge.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:33.120]   I think that's, you know, it goes without saying.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:34.520]   I think he would focus on that part
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:36.840]   'cause I think he would really love it.
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:40.480]   He would be very alarmed by the idea of tariffs
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:43.720]   and very alarmed by the return to protectionism.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:46.720]   I mean, I think he believed that part of what
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.400]   made the world peaceful in the second half
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:53.520]   of the 20th century, as opposed to during World War II,
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:56.520]   was the world was knit together more by trade,
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:57.840]   and that was the great hope,
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:00.920]   that if people traded with each other, they wouldn't fight.
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:03.760]   He's also, you know, a proponent
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.840]   of the free movement of capital.
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:07.880]   You know, he would absolutely oppose this idea
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:10.960]   that Nippon Steel wasn't allowed to invest
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:13.320]   in the United States, you know?
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:15.360]   I think he would struggle,
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.640]   and he wholeheartedly embraced Reagan,
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:20.560]   and he worked to minimize the parts
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.840]   of the Reagan legacy he didn't like.
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:25.480]   I think he would find it harder to embrace Trump
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:28.400]   because he's not of that style,
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:29.840]   and he just had a different style,
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:32.280]   but I'm guessing he would have come around
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:35.080]   through the, I think he would just say,
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:38.240]   "Okay, we have a chance to reduce the size of government."
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:41.760]   At the same time, those spending plans
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:43.520]   of the Trump administration
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:46.120]   are not fiscally conservative in any way,
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:49.600]   and that was his concern, was not so much with debt,
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:52.880]   but with the feeling that there's no mechanism
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:54.600]   to stop the growth of government,
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.760]   that it just grows and grows and grows,
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:58.880]   and so he ended up believing,
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:01.520]   like, even deficits aren't so bad
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:04.080]   because they make politicians cautious,
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:07.240]   he thought, about continuing to spend,
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:09.840]   but I have to believe he would be concerned
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:14.840]   about the potential threats to the U.S. currency's position
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:17.200]   as the world's reserve currency
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:19.800]   with increased levels of debt and spending.
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:24.640]   He was concerned about low interest rates.
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:30.720]   He died, I think it's 2004, 2006,
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.160]   but it was in the beginning,
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:33.440]   he didn't see the zero low bound,
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:34.600]   but he saw low interest rates,
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.720]   and he said, "This isn't necessarily good."
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.560]   Everyone's talking about low interest rates
[01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:39.920]   as if they're good,
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:42.640]   but there should be a price on capital.
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:44.320]   There should be a price on this.
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:45.640]   It shouldn't be so low,
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:49.760]   and so he had some of, still,
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:52.440]   the kind of macro insights that I think are important.
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:55.320]   - You wrote the Wall Street Journal essay
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:58.600]   titled "How Inflation Ended Neoliberalism
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.200]   and Re-Elected Trump."
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:02.800]   So can we weave that into this discussion
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:07.480]   in terms of inflation and Trump?
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:09.200]   What's the main idea of the essay?
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:11.720]   - So the main idea is kind of looking back
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:16.480]   and saying, so today we have been living in a world
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:21.480]   where people have been focused on monetary policy,
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:27.080]   steady monetary policy, free trade, reducing regulation.
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:29.960]   This is all called the neoliberal era,
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:33.840]   and my argument was a lot of that arose,
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.480]   was driven by inflation.
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:39.400]   So we have Milton Friedman predict inflation in 1967.
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:41.760]   It starts breaking out in the 1970s,
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.560]   Britain and the United States,
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:48.560]   and every institution was designed around stable prices,
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:53.680]   and once inflation broke out, prices were no longer stable.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:58.160]   So for example, tax rates weren't inflation-adjusted.
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:02.040]   So if your income went up because of inflation,
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:03.640]   you might bump from a low tax rate
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:05.120]   to an extremely high tax rate,
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:06.800]   but you don't actually have more money.
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:09.200]   On paper, you have more money, but everything costs more,
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:10.320]   so you don't actually have more money,
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:12.040]   and your taxes have gone up.
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:14.520]   That kicks off the taxpayer revolt.
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:17.520]   There's a whole shift of American corporations
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:20.240]   towards focusing on financial investments
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:24.520]   because the tax breaks they used to get for depreciation,
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:27.120]   for building new factories, are not inflation-adjusted,
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:30.400]   so they no longer pay off in an inflationary environment,
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:35.400]   and then when Paul Volcker comes in in 1980s, early 1980s,
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:38.000]   and starts fighting inflation,
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.200]   really pushes up interest rates to bring down inflation,
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:44.200]   and that completely reorders the banking sector
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.520]   because banks had statutory legal limits
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:49.960]   on the interest they could charge,
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:54.120]   and once general market interest rates exceeded that,
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:56.680]   it was proliferation of new financial forms
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:58.080]   to take advantage of that.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.880]   So my point was the era we live in
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:03.760]   was ushered in by inflation,
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:08.760]   and then everyone turned against all the formulations we had
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:12.440]   and said, well, these have hollowed out our industrial base.
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:16.680]   These have, we've got too much immigration,
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:18.800]   we've got too much economic openness,
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.640]   we need to reshore, we need to focus,
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.920]   we need to turn against all these things,
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:25.200]   we need to spend more, we've disinvested,
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:30.200]   and the net result of that turning away, I argued,
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:32.240]   is people forgot about inflation.
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.080]   They really forgot it could ever exist,
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:35.480]   and you had a whole set of theories
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:37.120]   on the left, modern monetary theory,
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:38.840]   that basically said we don't really need
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:41.720]   to worry about inflation, we can spend what we want,
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.480]   and lo and behold, inflation came back,
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:48.560]   and so my argument is that has now opened the door
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.240]   to the presidency of Donald Trump,
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:55.040]   which is potentially a deeply transformative moment
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:58.840]   that will change the size and shape of government,
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:01.320]   that may change our foreign policy profoundly,
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:05.000]   that may change our immigration policy,
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.040]   it may change the demographics of our country,
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:09.000]   all of that, and my thesis is that
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.600]   it's all been made possible by inflation,
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:16.640]   and so the great mistake of the past years
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:19.640]   was to forget how fundamental inflation was
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:22.320]   to the rise of the last political order,
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:27.320]   and to profoundly underestimate how much inflation
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:30.120]   would change the current political order,
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:32.640]   so I just think it's one of these things,
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:34.240]   this is why I think you should study history,
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:35.640]   because I think if you had studied history,
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:37.200]   you would be aware of this,
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:40.440]   and it's so easy for people to forget,
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.800]   just like the banks forgot that interest rates
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:44.800]   could ever go up, they got so used to it,
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:47.400]   and it's only a 10, 15 year thing,
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:48.920]   but to them that seems like forever,
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:52.480]   so I really do believe what history teaches you to do
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:57.120]   is just have a much vaster scope in your vision,
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:59.560]   and then take into account the possibilities
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:01.640]   of so many things happening that are different
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:02.840]   than what's happening today,
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:06.600]   and so I just hope we don't forget about inflation entirely,
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:07.560]   but here's the thing,
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:11.640]   there's quite a strong chance that Trump's policies
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:14.240]   will initiate even worse inflation,
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:17.280]   and then they will prove to be his undoing,
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:20.040]   so the ironies of inflation could be continuing.
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:24.800]   - Like you said, Milton Friedman would be a big fan of Doge,
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:27.400]   so if he was still here today,
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:30.080]   and rolled with Elon Musk and Vivek,
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:31.640]   what advice would he give?
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:34.120]   What do you think he would focus on
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:36.600]   in terms of where to cut, how to cut,
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:38.080]   how to think about cutting?
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:41.040]   - You know, his signature policy move,
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:45.320]   I talk about this, is taking the price mechanism
[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:49.160]   and trying to make that into the policy,
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:52.560]   and that seems sort of obvious to us today,
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:54.400]   but in the era that he came in,
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:57.080]   so there would be rent controls,
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.320]   let's take away rent controls,
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:00.520]   let's let housing prices set themselves,
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:03.560]   or he was very against national parks,
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:05.360]   I actually think that national parks are good,
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:07.400]   so I hope the Doge people don't take this up,
[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:11.680]   but rather than an allocation to fund the national parks,
[01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:14.400]   they should be funded by the revenue that they bring in
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:15.640]   when people visit them,
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:18.600]   and so I think he was always looking to,
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:20.520]   let's let prices make the decisions here,
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:23.560]   so I think that would be one of the key pieces.
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:25.800]   The other thing I think he'd really be thinking about,
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:27.200]   he wrote about this a lot,
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:31.680]   about occupational licensure and barriers to entry,
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:33.440]   and he felt like one of the worst things
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:35.000]   that government does,
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.360]   and sometimes it's private entities that do this,
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.160]   is create barriers to entry
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.440]   to protect industries and markets,
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:44.440]   so he talked about this in the case of the medical profession
[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:46.680]   which I think is actually not a good example
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:49.680]   because I think we all have a collective investment
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:52.440]   in having medical doctors be highly trained,
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:53.320]   but so for instance,
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:55.520]   you could look at, you know,
[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.360]   nail technicians or hair cutting,
[01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:59.240]   there's often these licensing requirements
[01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:00.680]   or there's a sort of big kerfuffle,
[02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:02.880]   I think it's DC passed a law
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.160]   that to run a childcare center,
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:05.320]   you have to have a college degree,
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.160]   well, what does that do?
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:07.360]   I mean, that disenfranchises
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:08.920]   a whole bunch of would-be entrepreneurs
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:10.280]   who don't happen to have a college degree,
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.360]   but probably could be really good
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:12.960]   at this particular business,
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:14.680]   so I think he would be saying,
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:18.280]   look out for where private interests
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:21.200]   have used the state to protect themselves
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:24.680]   and clear away those types of barriers
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:29.680]   and let competition through prices guide outcomes.
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:32.240]   - Yeah, so open up for more competition
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:36.480]   and allow for more signals from the market
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:38.040]   to drive decisions and so on.
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:38.960]   - Yes, yes.
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:41.560]   - Which would actually naturally lead
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:46.560]   to cutting a lot of the bureaucracy of government.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:49.880]   - I think the other thing he would probably be arguing for
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:52.640]   is again, go back to the design of the minimum income
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.440]   or the negative income tax,
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:58.000]   that there's a way he ultimately decided
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.360]   to run it through the tax system, right?
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:01.760]   The government's already collecting this data,
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:03.120]   they already have your information
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:05.880]   and they can just send the money out through the system,
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:07.960]   rather than having a social bureaucracy
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.480]   where you have to come in in person,
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:11.200]   you have to fill out forms,
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.880]   you have to document, do you own a car?
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:14.800]   What's your income?
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.720]   Who lives in the household?
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:17.760]   So I think he would say,
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:21.520]   and his analysis of that was who that really benefited
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:26.520]   was the bureaucracy that processed that paper,
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:29.360]   that implemented those norms
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:31.520]   and that if you could pull that away,
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:34.640]   you could get help out where it was needed much quicker
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:36.800]   without having this drag of people
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:38.560]   doing sort of unproductive work
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:39.840]   of administering these systems.
[02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:41.680]   So I think trying to cut administrative overhead
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:44.520]   and what he didn't have then, which we have now,
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:46.440]   is the technology that we have
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:50.080]   and the ability to send benefits out via smartphone
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:53.600]   or just to move so much faster
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:58.120]   and to handle information on a mass scale so much faster.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:00.320]   - It's painful, but I think one of the big things
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:04.160]   you can do is just that, which is digitalize,
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:05.480]   I don't know if that's a word,
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:08.480]   but just convert everything
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:13.480]   to where the speed of signal can be instantaneous.
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:18.400]   So there's no paperwork, it goes immediately.
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:22.480]   And then that means that the pricing signals
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.320]   and all of these kinds of things
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:26.560]   are just immediately available to people.
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:28.160]   - That seems to be the low-hanging fruit.
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:33.160]   Government IT systems could be vastly improved upon.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:34.560]   - But that would result again
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:37.220]   with a lot of people getting fired.
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:41.520]   And I think somebody submitted a question for me
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:45.240]   saying like, what are your thoughts
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:46.820]   as a person who cares about compassion?
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:49.260]   What are your thoughts about government employees,
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:54.260]   which there's a lot of, that are going to be hurt by Doge?
[02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:56.400]   - Yeah.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:59.440]   - And it's always a really difficult question.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:03.680]   A lot of people get fired to make room for a new system.
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:05.740]   That's going to lead to a lot of pain.
[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:07.600]   - There is gonna be a lot of pain.
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:09.240]   I don't know what the solution is.
[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:14.240]   I think that's also part of why Friedman favored
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:15.120]   a minimum income.
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:17.340]   He talked about it being sort of counter-cyclical.
[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:21.620]   In other words, when things were really bad,
[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:23.820]   the spending level on it would naturally go up.
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:26.820]   This is what economists today call an automatic stabilizer.
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:31.320]   And then when it's not needed, the cost of it goes down.
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:34.900]   I mean, maybe there's a way to make it,
[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:36.900]   sweeten it with honey and have people take buyouts
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:37.740]   or things like that.
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:41.140]   That would certainly be a way better way to go.
[02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:43.380]   - I did a podcast with Javier Millay.
[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:46.000]   He has consistently praised Milton Friedman
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]   and cited him as one of his inspirations.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.120]   So what do you think Milton Friedman would say
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:54.320]   about what's going on in Argentina
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:56.880]   and what Javier Millay is trying to do in Argentina?
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:58.400]   - Yeah, I think he would appreciate it.
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:00.600]   I mean, I think Millay is much more
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:03.560]   of an Austrian-inspired thinker,
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:05.520]   but I think he definitely appreciates Friedman.
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:09.040]   And on the macro level, Friedman always understood
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:12.760]   it's really painful to treat inflation.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:15.880]   But the more you put it off, the harder it is.
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:19.360]   So I think he would be trying to get him,
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:24.200]   as he's doing, to just message that short-term pain,
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:25.680]   long-term gain.
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:27.000]   I think he'd be very supportive.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]   I think he'd be thrilled to see.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.880]   Also that Millay is very good at explaining
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:33.360]   these abstract ideas and putting his policies
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:35.280]   in the framework of the bigger picture.
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:37.840]   That was really meaningful to Friedman.
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:41.320]   I don't know how politically persuasive it is overall.
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:44.320]   You know, Millay's very intense.
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:48.640]   He doesn't have the same sort of gifts of salesmanship
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:49.680]   and setting people at ease
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:51.240]   that say someone like Ronald Reagan had,
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:53.160]   but it seems to be that's what his country
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:55.080]   was calling for right now, so.
[02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:59.640]   - Yeah, he is more chainsaw-less, like warm blanket.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:05.600]   Javier recollects this line from Milton Friedman.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:06.600]   I don't know if this is accurate,
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:09.440]   but if you strive for equality over freedom,
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:10.760]   you often get neither.
[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:13.480]   But if you strive for freedom, you often get both.
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:15.680]   Do you think there's truth to this?
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:18.800]   - You know, I think on the big picture, definitely.
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:23.800]   I mean, we've seen focusing too much on equality.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:28.600]   It can be, because equality is such an alluring word,
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:31.080]   it can lead you to downgrade all kinds of other things
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:32.560]   that are really important.
[02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:34.480]   But I really think it depends
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:35.640]   on how you're defining freedom.
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:39.440]   I mean, the statement is too big and too broad, right?
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:44.440]   So, you know, if you're talking about freedom,
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:49.800]   if by freedom you mean not having to pay taxes
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:51.640]   if you're successful, you know,
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:54.800]   I think that can have all kinds of knock-on effects, right?
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:57.840]   The idea that people are able to prosper
[02:05:57.840 --> 02:05:59.360]   when they're educated.
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:02.000]   Where's education gonna come from?
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.320]   How is that gonna be paid for and supported?
[02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:07.120]   And again, to go back to Knight,
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:10.320]   if you're generating too much inequality,
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:11.440]   or people are feeling
[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:13.600]   that you're generating too much inequality,
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:16.800]   sometimes they value that more than they value freedom.
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.040]   And so I think the balance,
[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:22.080]   I think there has to be more of a balance.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:24.880]   And it's just, it's hard to make such global statements
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:25.880]   if you have to break them down
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:27.680]   into what actually do you mean.
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:31.880]   But again, Malay is coming from a very different context,
[02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:35.720]   a very different country that has seen so much upheaval,
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:38.120]   so much government intervention, so much inflation,
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:39.840]   so much political turmoil.
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:43.120]   He's probably thinking about it differently
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:44.680]   than Friedman was thinking about it.
[02:06:44.680 --> 02:06:46.680]   - Yeah, I mean, there was,
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:49.880]   there probably still is a real threat of hyperinflation.
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:52.720]   There seems to be a very high level of corruption
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:54.160]   or the capacity for corruption.
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:57.040]   So it's a really messy situation.
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:01.360]   So Javier Malay likes to recollect this great line
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:02.760]   from Milton Friedman,
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:05.240]   that if you strive for equality over freedom,
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:06.800]   you often get neither.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:10.160]   But if you strive for freedom, you often get both.
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:12.560]   Do you think there's a truth to this?
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:15.720]   - Yeah, I think in the macro, for sure.
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:17.080]   I mean, we've seen,
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:19.600]   if you really put equality as your goal,
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:22.800]   it's such a seductive ideal
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:24.360]   and people believe in it so much
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:27.760]   that they can carry out horrible crimes
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:29.360]   in the name of equality.
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:31.240]   But then focusing on freedom,
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:33.160]   these words are too big.
[02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:35.080]   They're so hard to define.
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:36.560]   And so I think you have to ask sort of like,
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:38.400]   what is the freedom you're talking about, right?
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:41.400]   If you're talking about the freedom of ordinary people
[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:43.120]   to be entrepreneurial,
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:46.360]   to make their own way, to start new things,
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:47.480]   to continue what they're doing,
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:48.920]   to keep what they've earned, for sure.
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:52.320]   I think that can increase the equality overall.
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:55.680]   If you're talking about lower taxes,
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:58.200]   if freedom is just a code for lower taxes
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:01.920]   or has to be, I mean, lower taxes in general, great.
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:05.800]   But if you're one of the top generators of wealth,
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:09.560]   there has to be some way to ensure that,
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:11.000]   say, education, right?
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.280]   People prosper when they're well-educated.
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:14.640]   That's when economies do better.
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:16.960]   Education is generally state-funded
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:18.960]   and you need some way to support that
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:22.880]   and provide for those institutions that structure society,
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:25.160]   that make competition possible.
[02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:28.920]   So I think it's just a really broad statement.
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:32.560]   But again, Malay is coming from a really different context.
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:35.040]   He's coming from the South American context
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:38.360]   from such upheaval, such economic devastation
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:41.280]   in pursuit of the goal of equality
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.920]   that I think trying to rebalance
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:44.120]   with that emphasis on freedom,
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:46.480]   I definitely see where he's coming from.
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:50.000]   - If we can pivot a little bit, we've talked about Reagan.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.480]   What are some interesting stories
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:54.240]   about how Milton Friedman navigated the Reagan
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:56.680]   and maybe even the Nixon administrations
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:09:00.560]   and how he was able to gain influence?
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:03.240]   - Well, the Nixon administration is an interesting case
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:06.240]   because, so I've been talking about inflation
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:09.440]   and the different consequences it had.
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:12.480]   One consequence it had is that it began to undermine
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:14.080]   the Bretton Woods currency system
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:16.400]   that was established in the wake of World War II.
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:19.440]   Now, Bretton Woods, what it did basically,
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:23.080]   it ended up inadvertently putting the U.S. dollar
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:24.960]   at the center of the world economic system.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:27.120]   But under Bretton Woods,
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:28.560]   countries of the industrialized West
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:30.920]   agreed to trade their currency
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:32.800]   in set ratios that government set.
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:36.400]   So a franc was worth so many dollars
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:38.400]   or a German mark was worth so many francs.
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:40.840]   And then also under this system,
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:42.600]   countries could come to the United States
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:47.600]   and they could trade the dollars that they held for gold
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:50.840]   'cause the U.S. was on a sort of modified gold standard.
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:54.880]   There was a ratio of gold to paper money.
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:59.160]   And so the system was set up and very quickly,
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:03.200]   most countries were, the dollar was at the heart of it
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:05.880]   in that the converting into and out of dollars
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:07.440]   was really the mechanism of trade
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:08.520]   for many of these countries.
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:11.560]   So Friedman said, you know,
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:15.280]   what we should have is floating exchange rates.
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:19.400]   This is an idea, again, of instead of having
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:22.880]   a top-down design of policy, an administered policy,
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:25.280]   we will have policy set by prices.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:27.240]   And you should be able to trade currencies
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:28.200]   on an open market.
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:29.720]   They should trade and they should fluctuate
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:31.280]   and that would be fine.
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:32.920]   Totally outlandish idea.
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:35.760]   But he was pinpointing the fact
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:38.400]   that Bretton Woods had an instability
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:40.360]   and that instability began to emerge
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:42.080]   in the time of inflation.
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:46.560]   So you have more and more dollars being printed.
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:49.080]   They're worth less and less.
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:54.080]   If European nations keep trading their currency for dollars,
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:56.400]   they're gonna be importing inflation
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:57.720]   into their own economies.
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:00.600]   So they say, we don't want these dollars,
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:02.320]   we'd like some gold instead.
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:04.440]   And they have the right to go to the treasury,
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:07.560]   send in an order and get gold out.
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:10.640]   And so they start doing this more and more
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:13.360]   and it becomes, it's called the gold drain
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:16.960]   and the United States starts running out of gold.
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:19.040]   They're aware this is happening through the '60s,
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:21.840]   they're trying various things to fix it.
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:26.000]   And when Nixon comes into office in '68,
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.680]   Friedman sends him a memo and it says,
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:35.080]   this is gonna be a real problem.
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:39.880]   He says something like, this is a running sore
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:42.080]   and you have to lance it right away.
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:44.160]   Some very graphic-- Very nice.
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:47.720]   Metaphor, otherwise it's gonna explode.
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:50.880]   And Nixon just files the memo away.
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:54.800]   Nixon loved people to think he was influenced by
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:57.480]   and following the wisdom of Milton Friedman,
[02:11:57.480 --> 02:11:59.560]   but he didn't actually want to do that.
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:02.640]   He just wanted the political benefit that came from it.
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:06.840]   So then comes the moment
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:09.840]   where the US Treasury Department realizes
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:12.320]   we're going to run out of gold.
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:13.160]   What should we do?
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:15.560]   And then everybody decamps to Camp David
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:20.120]   and Nixon decides we're just gonna stop
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:22.080]   redeeming currency for gold.
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:25.440]   It's called slamming the gold window shut, done.
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:28.240]   And he also at that same meeting
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:31.040]   decides to institute price controls.
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:32.280]   He does a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:33.400]   It's an emergency.
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:35.160]   He calls it the new economic plan,
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:38.520]   which is an unconscious echo of the Soviet new economic plan.
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:42.400]   So a problematic name, a problematic policy.
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:45.120]   And Friedman is livid at the price controls,
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:46.920]   but he's like, actually,
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:48.680]   it's great that you closed the gold window.
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:51.160]   Let's go all the way to floating exchange rates.
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:54.680]   And this idea was heresy within the Treasury Department.
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:59.680]   Everyone's very committed to the idea of the gold standard,
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:01.400]   convertibility, possibility,
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:04.240]   the United States at the core of the financial system,
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:05.520]   kind of Hammond Hall.
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:06.360]   But at this point,
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:09.440]   Friedman has a very close relationship with George Shultz.
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:12.840]   And George Shultz is a high level appointee
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:14.400]   who will eventually,
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.960]   over the course of the next administrations,
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:17.440]   become the Treasury Secretary.
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:22.040]   And so Friedman is feeding Shultz all his ideas
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:24.800]   about how we should move to floating exchange rates,
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:27.680]   how we shouldn't try to reconstruct Bretton Woods.
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:29.280]   And the people in Treasury,
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:31.760]   it's funny 'cause I've read some of their accounts
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:32.760]   and actually Paul Volcker
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:34.480]   is in the Treasury Department at this time.
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:37.800]   And he can kind of sense that Friedman is in here somewhere,
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:40.400]   you know, like feeding his boss ideas.
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:41.840]   He doesn't quite know.
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:43.720]   And you know, in the oral history,
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:45.760]   Shultz talks about this quite a bit.
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:46.600]   So at any rate,
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:49.400]   Friedman exerts this behind the scenes influence.
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:52.200]   And what Shultz does is just kind of
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:54.080]   lets Bretton Woods fade away.
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:56.080]   He doesn't make grand pronouncements.
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:01.080]   It just slowly the world shifts to a regime.
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:06.040]   For a while, it was like a regime of steady prices.
[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:08.240]   And then they call it a steady regime of changing prices
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:09.080]   or whatever.
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:11.040]   The language changes, the reality changes,
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:12.560]   and they kind of end up where they are.
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:15.720]   So that's a real measure of Friedman's influence.
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:18.240]   If there had been another economist in Shultz's ear
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:20.720]   that said, "No, catastrophe is imminent.
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:22.560]   "We have to go back to Bretton Woods."
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:24.000]   He probably would have worked harder.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.080]   The US government would have worked harder.
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:30.440]   And so that becomes one of these pieces of globalization.
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:32.080]   And you know, what people don't realize
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:33.600]   is there used to be,
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:36.240]   in addition to these floating set capital ratios,
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:38.320]   you couldn't bring capital in and out of different countries
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:39.240]   and you had to register.
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:40.600]   You couldn't invest.
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:42.160]   For all these rules and strictures
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:43.960]   and the falling of Bretton Woods
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:45.240]   really blows that all open.
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:47.000]   It's a precursor to globalization.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.320]   So Friedman is right there.
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:52.440]   Now, he's very ambivalent about Nixon.
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:55.960]   I mean, he sees that Nixon is not an honest person.
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:57.560]   He thinks he's very intelligent.
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:02.920]   And Nixon's dream is to create a new centrist majority.
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:05.080]   So he does many things to go back
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:08.640]   on his supposed economic principles and ideals.
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:09.840]   So Friedman does not like this.
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:11.720]   He doesn't like the price controls.
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:14.920]   He's in communication with his old mentor, Arthur Burns,
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:16.840]   who's now the chair of the Federal Reserve.
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:20.080]   And Burns is basically doing everything wrong
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:21.280]   in monetary policy.
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:23.960]   And I described this in the book in some detail,
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:25.800]   these anguished letters back and forth.
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:28.800]   And basically, as I see it,
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:31.160]   Burns doesn't have a solid theory of inflation.
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:34.080]   And the more Friedman pushes him,
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:36.840]   it's almost like Burns is willfully ignoring Friedman
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:39.000]   and kind of doing the opposite of what Friedman says.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.280]   So Burns is running a very loose monetary policy.
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:44.440]   Inflation is quite considerable over the '70s.
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:47.160]   I mean, we were all spooked by what did it get to 6%,
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:50.320]   something like that, recently for a very short time.
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:54.080]   This is inflation going over 10%, hovering in 8%
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:55.960]   for basically the whole decade of the '70s,
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:58.480]   going up and down with extremely elevated rates.
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:02.760]   And so the Carter presidency largely falls,
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:04.200]   foreign policy is a big part of it,
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:06.160]   but the failure to tame inflation is part of it.
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:08.080]   And then Reagan comes in.
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:11.280]   And now Reagan loves Friedman and Friedman loves Reagan,
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:13.440]   very mutual feeling.
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:14.680]   The Reagan administration creates
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:17.360]   like an advisory economic board, Friedman's on it.
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:21.000]   He's retired now, he's entering his kind of golden years,
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.640]   but he really has Reagan's ear.
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:26.640]   And here what he does is he convinces Reagan
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:28.240]   of his theory of inflation,
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:30.760]   which is inflation has been caused.
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:32.880]   It's a monetary phenomenon that has been caused
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:34.440]   by bad monetary policy.
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:38.600]   Inflation has an accelerating dynamic.
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:43.480]   The only way to end inflation is by really showing
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:46.000]   and signaling that government policy has changed.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.000]   And when you do that, it's very painful
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.200]   for a short amount of time, people will suffer,
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:54.400]   but then you will come out on the other side
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:55.840]   into stable prices.
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:58.560]   And this is what you need for economic prosperity.
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:03.240]   So the man who implements this policy, Paul Volcker,
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:05.680]   he's definitely influenced by Friedman,
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:08.240]   buys a big picture of Friedman.
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:11.800]   He even buys Friedman's specific technique
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:13.520]   of the monetary growth rule
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:15.960]   and of the focus on monetary aggregates,
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:17.880]   which Friedman has said, right, money matters,
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:20.640]   aggregates matter, and that's what money is.
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:25.160]   Pretty quickly, Volcker finds that because of inflation
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:27.960]   and the financial deregulation in response to it,
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:31.360]   the aggregates don't work the way Friedman said they would.
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:35.000]   And so the specific policy Friedman recommends,
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.240]   Volcker tries it for a year or so, doesn't work super well.
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:42.000]   But what does work is letting interest rates go high,
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.560]   go above inflation to a point where
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:47.840]   both the general citizenry and the financial markets
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:50.720]   believe like, oh, they're actually serious about inflation.
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:52.440]   And because we've had a decade of inflation
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:54.880]   with all these presidents saying, you know,
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:57.600]   going forward, we're gonna whip inflation now,
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:00.040]   that monetary policy has lost credibility.
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:02.680]   This is why people focus so much on credibility today,
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:05.360]   'cause once it's lost, it's really hard to get it back.
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:09.440]   And one way Volcker gets it back is interest rates over 20%,
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:12.480]   unemployment very high, as high as 25%
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:15.000]   in like construction sectors.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.960]   And as this is happening,
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:19.400]   Milton Friedman is whispering in Reagan's ear,
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:21.080]   this is the right thing.
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:23.600]   Stay the course, this is going to work.
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:27.520]   Now, interestingly, he hates Volcker, Volcker hates him,
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:30.080]   and Friedman will never give Volcker credit for this policy,
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:32.600]   but he will give Reagan credit for this policy.
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:37.600]   But he owes credit himself for keeping Reagan
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:41.520]   from wobbling on this policy and just pushing it through.
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:43.920]   And he also tells Reagan very pragmatically,
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:47.040]   you better do this now, you've got a four-year term,
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:49.400]   do this in the first two years of your term,
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:51.640]   things will have turned around by 1984
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:52.920]   when you run for re-election
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:53.840]   and you'll benefit from it.
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:55.920]   And that's absolutely what happens.
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:57.480]   - If we could take a small tangent.
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:58.320]   - Yeah.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:00.080]   - Sort of a question I have to ask
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:02.520]   about since we mentioned Bretton Woods
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:03.760]   and maybe the gold standard,
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:05.800]   maybe just have a general discussion
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:08.160]   about this whole space of ideas.
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:09.560]   There's a lot of people today
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:11.160]   that care about cryptocurrency.
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:12.560]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:15.240]   - What do you think that Milton Friedman
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:17.680]   would say about cryptocurrency
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:22.680]   and what role crypto might play in the economy?
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:28.680]   Whether he would be for this idea, against this idea,
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:31.400]   and if we could look at it for today
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:34.560]   and also just 10, 100 years from now.
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:37.240]   - There's a clip, I think it's in 1992,
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:40.080]   where people say, oh, Friedman predicted cryptocurrencies
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:43.040]   because he's talking about how payments
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:45.200]   will eventually be electronic.
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:47.760]   So in some ways, he definitely,
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:49.000]   as he was looking at the computer and money,
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.320]   he knew these would come together in some way.
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:56.320]   I think he probably would see a use case for crypto.
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:59.560]   He definitely would not buy the stronger forms,
[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:02.440]   I think, of crypto ideology
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:05.320]   in which we could be heading towards a future
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:07.360]   in which there's many different currencies that compete
[02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:09.720]   or that are distributed or there's a stateless currency.
[02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:12.040]   And he addresses this very, very clearly
[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:14.880]   because Hayek's denationalization of money,
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:17.200]   it's a paper in the late '70s,
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:20.480]   Hayek argues for this kind of competing currency model
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:22.800]   or regime, and so he's responding to that.
[02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:25.560]   He's responding to people writing about free banking.
[02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:27.240]   And he basically says, look,
[02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:31.160]   even if you developed a variety of competing currencies,
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:33.840]   eventually society would converge on one.
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:36.360]   And that's because people just want one currency
[02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:39.200]   that they know, they don't want a bunch of different options.
[02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:41.800]   Even in places where there have been options to do that,
[02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:43.640]   they've been used very minimally.
[02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:46.920]   And then he says, secondly, the state always steps in.
[02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:50.360]   He says, technically, theoretically, it doesn't have to.
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:51.600]   I could draw you a model.
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:54.560]   I could tell you about how it could work without the state,
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:56.600]   but in actual reality,
[02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:59.760]   all human societies through time and space,
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:02.400]   the state eventually becomes involved
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:03.600]   in the provision of money
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:06.840]   because it has so many knock-on effects to so many people.
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:09.640]   So, sure, I think he would, again,
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:12.320]   find a use case for crypto, think it's interesting,
[02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:13.880]   but I don't think he would see it
[02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:16.240]   as this is going to displace state money
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:21.000]   and we're going to have a variety of distributed currencies.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:22.720]   The other thing he really stresses
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:25.720]   is that a change in a monetary system,
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:28.840]   it only happens amid great, great crisis.
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:31.520]   So, again, you see in countries
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:34.680]   where the state is not controlling the money well,
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:36.400]   that's when people are more turning to crypto,
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:39.040]   but he says, because money is so fundamental,
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:42.280]   there are going to be so much political pressure
[02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:47.280]   on any country that gets the currency profoundly wrong
[02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:49.000]   that the government will fall
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.400]   and another one will replace it, right?
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:52.660]   So, if you look at episodes of hyperinflation,
[02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:55.080]   they don't go on very long
[02:21:55.080 --> 02:21:57.800]   because they're so upsetting to people.
[02:21:57.800 --> 02:21:59.440]   - If we can go back in time,
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:01.080]   we've talked about it a bunch,
[02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:03.560]   but it's still a fascinating time.
[02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:06.840]   The Great Depression, University of Chicago,
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:10.680]   there's these folks like Jacob Viner, Frank Knight,
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:13.880]   Henry Simons, all of these influenced the thinking
[02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:15.420]   of Milton Friedman.
[02:22:15.420 --> 02:22:19.560]   There's this Room 7 situation at the University of Chicago.
[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:21.860]   Just going back there,
[02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:24.080]   even just speaking almost philosophically,
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:27.160]   what does it take to explore ideas together,
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:30.520]   sort of like deliberate, argue in that space,
[02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:32.520]   and maybe there might be interesting stories
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:33.640]   about that time.
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:36.440]   It would just be interesting to understand
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:39.640]   how somebody like Milton Friedman forms
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:43.360]   - The seed is planted and the flower blooms.
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:44.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:47.600]   So, he gets to University of Chicago,
[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:49.920]   he makes fast friends,
[02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:52.320]   and in his third and fourth year,
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:54.760]   they become what I call them the Room 7 gang.
[02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:57.960]   So, Room 7 is they find an old storeroom in the basement,
[02:22:57.960 --> 02:22:59.200]   they take it over,
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:01.320]   and that's where they have their jam sessions.
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:04.880]   And what made this world come together was Frank Knight.
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:06.800]   There was a charismatic leader
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:08.280]   and there were a bunch of acolytes
[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:10.440]   who clustered around him.
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:12.760]   That, I think, was a key piece of the ingredient.
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:15.800]   And then there was a sense that they were onto something
[02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:18.080]   that the rest of the economics field
[02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:19.680]   had forgotten or was rejecting.
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:21.840]   So, there was like that sense of mission.
[02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:24.960]   So, that seems to have been,
[02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:27.440]   there was a formal education piece,
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.760]   and then there was a parallel education piece
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:33.440]   rooted in admiration for a thinker, a shared admiration.
[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:36.600]   And then what that led Friedman to do,
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:40.160]   you know, what I found syllabi, you know,
[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:42.520]   that he had from non-economics courses,
[02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:43.360]   lists of books,
[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:45.080]   and he'd written the prices of different ones
[02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:46.000]   he wanted to read.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.320]   So, he had, you know, John Stuart Mill on liberty,
[02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:50.440]   like 50 cents written in the margin.
[02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:52.560]   So, he began to educate himself.
[02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:55.240]   He gave himself a like parallel curriculum
[02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:57.480]   alongside this very formal economics curriculum.
[02:23:57.480 --> 02:23:58.800]   He started reading, you know,
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:01.360]   the traditions of political liberalism,
[02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:03.080]   and then talking them through with friends
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:05.920]   and developing like a shared sense of mission.
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:07.760]   And that, the incredible thing is,
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:10.240]   of those friends in the group,
[02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:12.240]   you know, they scattered for like 10 years,
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:14.040]   and then they all came back together.
[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:15.680]   You know, George Stigler, his great friend,
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:17.320]   was hired at Chicago.
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:20.440]   Aaron Director, who was his wife's brother,
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:21.680]   was at Chicago.
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.080]   So many of these people continued.
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:26.040]   He became Frank Knight's colleague.
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:28.320]   So, that was the base.
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:29.720]   That was what really grew him,
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:32.400]   that really profound peer group.
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:34.360]   Now, the other piece I talk about a lot
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:38.000]   is Freeman was a collaborator,
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.480]   an open-minded collaborator.
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:41.320]   And he had incredible connections
[02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:43.080]   with economists who were women.
[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:44.520]   And he basically found,
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:47.560]   first in the figure of Anna Schwartz,
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:49.240]   later in the figure of this group of women
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:51.760]   who were his wife's friends,
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:54.120]   this kind of untapped pool of talent.
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:56.480]   And so, he immersed himself in this whole other world
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:58.680]   of consumption economics.
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:00.040]   And that resulted in, you know,
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:02.960]   his more technical work on a theory
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.120]   of the consumption function,
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:06.280]   which is the theory of permanent income.
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:08.840]   So, for Freedman, intellectual work
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:11.400]   and intellectual production was always done
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:13.720]   in this very social context,
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:16.640]   in a context that blended friendship
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:19.040]   and intellectual partnership.
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:22.080]   And he really, he only had a handful of friends
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:24.320]   who were not also economists,
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:25.920]   interested in the same questions he was.
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:30.080]   So, he just lived and breathed ideas all day long.
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:31.560]   - Can you speak to the jam sessions?
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:33.200]   Like, what do we know about the jam sessions?
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:34.600]   What are we talking about here?
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:35.880]   You're sitting in a room.
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:37.480]   Are they analyzing?
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:39.320]   Are they reading papers and discussing papers?
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:41.440]   Or are they arguing more, like,
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:42.640]   over beers kind of situation?
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:44.640]   - Yeah, more arguing over beers.
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:48.120]   And in this case, there's several people who say
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:50.240]   it was all about Frank Knight.
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:51.520]   What did he say?
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.040]   What did he mean when he said it?
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:54.400]   Is he right?
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:56.000]   And so, Knight was very,
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.640]   he would say one thing and then say another.
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:25:59.720]   If you read him, it's very hard to follow
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:00.760]   what he's actually saying,
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:02.400]   because he's full of qualifications.
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:03.480]   And irony isn't blends.
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:07.680]   And so, he would throw out these pieces,
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:09.720]   and then the students would kind of clutch at them.
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:11.000]   And then they would come back together
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.840]   and try to assemble this sort of worldview.
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:15.920]   And then Frank Knight fell into this terrible depression,
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:19.480]   and to cheer him up, they planned a big party.
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:23.000]   And they went back through all of his previous writings,
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.640]   and they assembled them into a book that was published.
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:27.160]   This is "The Ethics of Competition."
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:28.480]   And you can read the introduction,
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:29.800]   written in part by Milton Friedman.
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:32.560]   So, not only were they talking about Knight
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:33.400]   and what he said,
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:36.000]   but then they started poring over his work.
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.280]   And one of them described it
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:39.240]   as like a general equilibrium system,
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:41.120]   where you had to know all the parts,
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:43.840]   and then all of a sudden it all fit together in a whole.
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:45.640]   So, if we step back,
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:48.520]   what they were doing was getting inside the mind
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:49.600]   of a great thinker,
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:52.160]   and understanding the ways it all fit together,
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.760]   and then kind of testing their ideas against Knight's.
[02:26:55.760 --> 02:26:59.520]   And what's fascinating is one of the first papers
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:02.080]   that Friedman publishes in "Statistics"
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:04.600]   is a rebuttal of Frank Knight.
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:07.200]   He publishes a rebuttal of Frank Knight's ideas
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:09.200]   about risk and uncertainty.
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:12.440]   And Frank Knight, he kind of took a black swan argument.
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:14.920]   He said, "Risk, you can calculate.
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:16.600]   "Uncertainty, you can't.
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:19.040]   "Like existentially, philosophically,
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:20.720]   "you can't get your hands around it.
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:22.240]   "It is the black swan."
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:24.400]   And Friedman publishes this statistical paper,
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:27.960]   and he says, "I can put uncertainty on a graph."
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:30.280]   And so, there's that sort of Freudian killing
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:32.520]   of the father element when he comes back,
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:35.240]   and he will, in some ways,
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:38.560]   turn his back on Knight's approach and Knight's pessimism,
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:41.120]   even while it's like a foundation of his thinking.
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:43.920]   - Fascinating.
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:46.320]   Is there something you could say about the thinking process
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:49.400]   that Milton Friedman followed?
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:52.680]   Like how he developed his ideas?
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:55.480]   You mentioned there's a strong collaborative component,
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:58.240]   but there's another story I saw about
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:03.160]   that I think his son recalled
[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:06.160]   about the argument number system that you mentioned.
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:08.440]   Which I, by the way, if you're gonna explain that
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:11.400]   as the tangent of a tangent, that's really awesome.
[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:14.880]   I think it's like number one if the other person is right.
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:19.200]   - Number two means you were right and I was wrong.
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:22.880]   And the number system evolved in some ways
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:24.680]   to be quick and efficient, but in other ways,
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:26.160]   they also were really clear about it.
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:29.200]   So, something like there's kind of like
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.360]   three reasons behind it.
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:35.360]   First is, if you use a number, it reminds the listener
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:39.520]   that it's really hard to say the words, "I was wrong."
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:42.400]   So, you're kind of calling on their sympathy
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:43.840]   by using number, reminding them
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:45.000]   that you're doing a hard thing.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.520]   And then, it's also reminding them
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:51.240]   that you're in this family with this code.
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:54.560]   And so, you're signaling your membership
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:57.040]   and your closeness and your love, really.
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:00.000]   And so, it's supposed to be an easy way to disagree
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.580]   without breaking the relationship.
[02:29:01.580 --> 02:29:04.400]   - Yeah, so admitting you're wrong
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:06.600]   now comes with this warm, fuzzy feeling.
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:07.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:10.800]   - And that's really, I mean, that's so powerful.
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:15.100]   I think so much of the friction of human interaction
[02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:18.320]   could be boiled down to just not being able to admit
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:20.440]   that you're wrong efficiently and quickly
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:23.560]   and regularly and just often.
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:26.480]   And to be able to do that, that's really powerful.
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:29.200]   - Yeah, I think it's a really neat aspect
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:30.800]   of their family life, for sure.
[02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:32.960]   - Sorry, that's a fun story,
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:37.560]   but can we just generalize to how he engaged in collaboration,
[02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:39.680]   how he developed his ideas?
[02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:41.880]   Is there a thinking process?
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:43.760]   - So, he taught at the University of Chicago,
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:45.560]   and he tended to teach for six months
[02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:46.960]   and then have six months off.
[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:50.320]   And he spent the summers in New Hampshire or Vermont.
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:51.760]   He had, right near that border,
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:52.880]   they had two different houses.
[02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:56.000]   And that to him was the deep thinking time.
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:00.440]   And so, when he's at Chicago, he's teaching, he's arguing.
[02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:05.200]   Some people loved his teaching style, very much in charge,
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:08.600]   very much keeping students on their toes, confrontational.
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:11.360]   Others found it too much, overwhelming,
[02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:12.920]   kind of shut them down intellectually,
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:15.000]   and they couldn't cope with it.
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.960]   And so, I think it was kind of go time when he was teaching.
[02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:21.480]   In that case, that was a lot of social time,
[02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:23.800]   interacting, talking, other professors,
[02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:25.320]   going out and giving papers,
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:27.600]   arguing with the people at Yale or Harvard.
[02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:30.440]   Then he would go and do these very deep dives
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:31.560]   over the summer.
[02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:34.520]   He would also regularly do these trips to New York
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:37.240]   to see Anna Schwartz, so his 12-year collaborator.
[02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:39.440]   They didn't have, phone calls were really expensive.
[02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:41.280]   They did have quite an extensive correspondence,
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:42.480]   but then they would do these meetings.
[02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:44.560]   So, he would basically come in
[02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:46.800]   at the beginning of the summer,
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:49.680]   going to Raleigh, stop in New York, see Schwartz,
[02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:51.760]   and then, again, on the way back to Chicago.
[02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:54.080]   So, you'd have these deep check-ins at that point.
[02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:55.120]   The other thing that happened
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:30:57.720]   is people would come visit him in New Hampshire.
[02:30:57.720 --> 02:30:59.800]   And so, he would have these,
[02:30:59.800 --> 02:31:01.520]   he had a studio separate from the house.
[02:31:01.520 --> 02:31:02.480]   He would go and he would work.
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:04.760]   And then at night, his friends would come.
[02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:06.000]   His friends are all economists.
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.120]   There's a whole cluster of economists.
[02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:10.600]   They all clustered within driving distance
[02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:11.920]   of the Dartmouth Library
[02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:14.160]   so that they could get their hands on books.
[02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:15.400]   And so, they would come over,
[02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:18.040]   and then they would argue and talk into the night.
[02:31:18.040 --> 02:31:22.240]   So, I think he did need that deep focus time,
[02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:23.760]   but it was not like,
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:28.640]   he also lived a very engaged, very embedded social life.
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:31.060]   - A part of which was his marriage.
[02:31:31.060 --> 02:31:33.960]   Is there something you could say about love,
[02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:35.680]   about marriage, about relationship
[02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:37.320]   that made the whole thing work?
[02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:40.640]   It was vibrant, and they wrote a biography together?
[02:31:40.640 --> 02:31:41.480]   - They did.
[02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:42.800]   I mean, they were very complimentary.
[02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:44.880]   They were kind of the yin and the yang.
[02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:47.760]   She was very introverted,
[02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:51.440]   somewhat suspicious of others, skeptical.
[02:31:51.440 --> 02:31:56.440]   And he was extremely extroverted, optimistic, high energy.
[02:31:56.440 --> 02:32:00.400]   And they also were at a time when it was really clear,
[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:03.440]   like, for broader society, these are the roles of a man,
[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:05.280]   these are the roles of a woman.
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:06.640]   And they pretty much adopted those.
[02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:11.320]   Now, Rose Friedman did some very important economic work.
[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:12.640]   She's part of the early stages
[02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:14.800]   of the theory of the consumption function.
[02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:16.240]   She didn't complete her degree
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:18.720]   because she really knew there wasn't,
[02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:21.240]   if she wanted to be married and have children in the world
[02:32:21.240 --> 02:32:23.440]   she'd lived in, there wasn't a real pathway
[02:32:23.440 --> 02:32:24.880]   to also being an economist.
[02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:28.520]   You know, I do think that a lot of that,
[02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:30.720]   it's not, although it feels very gendered,
[02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:32.640]   like, you know, he's the man out in the world
[02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:33.800]   and she's in private.
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:35.720]   It's interesting because her brother, Aaron Director,
[02:32:35.720 --> 02:32:36.560]   was the same way.
[02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:39.840]   He was very private man, very shy, very introverted.
[02:32:39.840 --> 02:32:42.320]   And he exerted this like quiet intellectual influence
[02:32:42.320 --> 02:32:44.080]   on all of his friends.
[02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:47.000]   So I think that was just kind of a family trait
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:50.240]   of being more quiet, preferring to be behind the scenes.
[02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:51.680]   It wouldn't have worked any other way
[02:32:51.680 --> 02:32:54.320]   because Friedman was so out there,
[02:32:54.320 --> 02:32:57.640]   so, you know, so extroverted.
[02:32:57.640 --> 02:32:59.720]   And there's a bit of a sad thing she said.
[02:32:59.720 --> 02:33:01.880]   She said, "When I married Milton,
[02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:04.320]   I lost half of my conversations.
[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:07.320]   When David came along, I lost the other half."
[02:33:07.320 --> 02:33:10.640]   So it was a household that was just dominated
[02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:13.800]   by male voices in which she didn't have a lot of room.
[02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:15.360]   What was tricky for me in my research
[02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:17.640]   is she didn't leave much of a trace.
[02:33:17.640 --> 02:33:19.960]   She put together Milton Friedman's archive
[02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:21.280]   and she took herself out of it.
[02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:25.280]   So I really had trouble finding her actual voice
[02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:26.600]   in the historical documents.
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:28.800]   And she didn't want to leave that behind.
[02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:32.480]   So it's absolutely essential piece of his success
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:34.000]   because she's the one who pushed him
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.080]   to do the Newsweek column, to do Free to Choose.
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:39.400]   And she really wrote capitalism and freedom.
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:41.520]   She took all his random notes
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:43.280]   and she put them together into a book.
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:45.920]   And that became this kind of testimony of his ideas,
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:48.760]   but she shared many of his ideas.
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:50.840]   And she, you know, without...
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:53.640]   When I think of Friedman, if you take away Anna Schwartz,
[02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:54.920]   if you take away Rose Friedman,
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:33:57.680]   if you take away the other woman who collaborated with him,
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:01.160]   you have a much thinner resume than the one he actually has.
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:04.320]   - Yeah, it's always sad and it always makes me wonder
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:09.320]   about the private secret conversations between partners.
[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:14.320]   Because they might not show up in the record,
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:16.720]   but they probably influenced the person
[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:18.720]   more than almost anything else.
[02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:20.760]   Those quiet little conversations.
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:22.560]   - Yeah.
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:27.080]   - If we can switch our path
[02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:32.840]   to another great mind of the 20th century, Ayn Rand.
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:36.360]   We talked about some of the similarities here
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:38.160]   about them being fighters for freedom
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:41.280]   and fighters for capitalism.
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:43.640]   What is Ayn Rand's philosophy?
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:47.280]   If you can give a big, 10,000-word summary of objectivism.
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:49.560]   - Yeah, so she called it objectivism.
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:51.000]   Trying to, she used to do this thing,
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.000]   like I can stand on one foot and say it.
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:58.880]   So it goes something like epistemology, reason,
[02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:02.600]   ethics, selfishness, politics, capitalism.
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:04.120]   And that was kind of how she summarized it.
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:05.760]   So what she did,
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:08.200]   there's a couple of things she did with objectivism.
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:11.680]   First of all, she says the key defining element
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:14.440]   of humanity is rationalism, the rational faculty.
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:17.760]   So that's what defines what humanity is.
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:19.760]   Therefore, there is an objective reality
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:22.360]   that we can access and know with our reason.
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:24.040]   That's the objective epistemology.
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:27.880]   And the one social and economic system
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:30.640]   that lets rationality flower
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:33.560]   and is based upon rationality is capitalism.
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:36.960]   And then rationality only works,
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:40.240]   in her view, as an individual capacity.
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:43.880]   And that rationality teaches that what you should do
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:47.440]   is pursue your interests.
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:50.720]   And so she ends up calling that selfishness.
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:55.440]   Now, it's tricky because selfishness has so many strong
[02:35:55.440 --> 02:35:57.560]   and negative connotations.
[02:35:57.560 --> 02:36:00.880]   And she meant, I think, something closer
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:05.840]   to self-actualization because she really tried
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:09.560]   to create this idea and express the idea
[02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:14.560]   that to be truly selfish did not mean trampling on others.
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:18.120]   It meant just being motivated
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:23.080]   by your own kind of internal measures and metrics.
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:26.920]   And so in her fiction, she tries to show this
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:31.320]   by showing the false selfishness of Peter Keating,
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:33.680]   who's an architect who kind of steps over everybody
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:35.560]   to advance his career.
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:37.320]   And she says that's not true selfishness
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:40.880]   because true selfishness would recognize it's false
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:43.800]   to take others' work and pass it off as your own.
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:45.640]   Now, the other big piece of objectivism
[02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:49.520]   is a very approach that's really inspired
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:53.440]   and related to Friedrich Nietzsche's idea
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:58.400]   of revaluing values or a genealogy of morals.
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:01.840]   And so she says what's happened here
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:05.000]   is Western culture has converged
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.840]   on this idea of altruism as good.
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:11.200]   Being selfless and altruistic is good.
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:14.280]   And this has led us to communism
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:16.400]   and has led us to devalue the individual
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:17.840]   in favor of the collective.
[02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:20.400]   So what we need is a new moral code
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:22.720]   which elevates selfishness,
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:24.160]   which elevates the individual,
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:25.520]   and which takes all the things
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:27.680]   that we have been told are bad
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:29.920]   and actually sets their values.
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:32.200]   This is what she's trying to do with objectivism.
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:33.840]   I mean, it is about as ambitious
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:36.720]   of an intellectual project as there can be.
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:40.360]   And that's what really draws people in.
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:41.400]   Yet at the same time,
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:45.800]   she's flying in the face of the way human morals
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:48.200]   and ethics and societies have evolved.
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:51.400]   And she's not able to single-handedly recreate them
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:52.760]   the way she wants them to be.
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:55.360]   - Yeah, I mean, she's not doing herself any favors
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:56.760]   by like taking on the words
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:37:58.920]   and trying to rebrand them completely,
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:01.640]   like writing "The Virtue of Selfishness."
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:04.720]   It's like, can we just call it self-actualization?
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:05.560]   - Yeah.
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:07.720]   - There's a negative connotation to selfishness
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:10.520]   and a positive connotation to altruism.
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:13.600]   So she sometimes, it seems,
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:18.040]   takes on the hardest possible form of argument.
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:21.000]   - Yeah, I mean, she had a student
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.200]   who ended up being very close to her,
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:25.280]   Nathaniel Brandon, and he was sort of an advisor,
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:27.280]   and he said, "Can you please not use selfishness?
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:28.520]   "Just come up with another word."
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:30.660]   But part of her liked it.
[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:33.360]   Part of her wanted to provoke and unsettle.
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:35.120]   She didn't wanna give that up.
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:39.420]   - I mean, people should listen to her public talks.
[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:46.680]   Her whole aura, way of being is provocative,
[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:49.760]   and she's a real powerhouse of an intellectual.
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:51.800]   So she loves the challenge.
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:56.480]   And that, just listening to her in itself is just inspiring
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:01.400]   'cause you could see the individualism radiate from her.
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:04.400]   - Yeah, I mean, that was one of the things I found
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:06.520]   in researching and writing about her.
[02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:09.800]   She's an incredibly unusual human being, you know?
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:12.760]   And so that was her strength, right,
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:14.840]   'cause she's so unusual, but it was also her downfall
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:17.740]   because she looked to herself as a model
[02:39:17.740 --> 02:39:20.840]   or to get insight about humanity,
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:23.440]   and she never quite processed how different she was
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:24.840]   from other people.
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:28.440]   - So just because we talked about Milton Friedman so much,
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:31.640]   can we just return to what to you,
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:33.600]   given everything we've said,
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:36.600]   is the interesting differences about Ayn Rand,
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:41.600]   her ideas related to Milton Friedman?
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:46.160]   - Yeah, I mean, broadly, we could put Milton Friedman
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:48.840]   and Ayn Rand in some sort of category together,
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:53.840]   but she has this focus on ethics and rationality
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:58.680]   and this desire to be revolutionary
[02:39:58.680 --> 02:40:00.960]   that's much stronger than Friedman.
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:04.800]   Friedman wanted to overthrow the economic consensus.
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:07.120]   He didn't want to overturn the moral basis
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:08.640]   of Western society.
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:12.320]   So she's also, she does something.
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:14.120]   So in one of Frank Knight's essays,
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:16.220]   he talks about the ethics of competition,
[02:40:16.220 --> 02:40:19.960]   and he says you basically cannot build an ethics
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:23.600]   out of competition because it would be monstrous to do so,
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:27.400]   because it would say the winner of this competition
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:28.800]   is ethically right,
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:31.800]   and that would open the door to sort of might makes right.
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:33.440]   And this is what Friedman struggles with,
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:36.960]   and he says, "I can't take capitalist outcomes
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:38.340]   "as ethical unto themselves.
[02:40:38.340 --> 02:40:39.180]   "I can't do it.
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:40.600]   "It doesn't feel right."
[02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:42.440]   And there's this line where Frank Knight says,
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:43.720]   "No one would ever do this."
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:45.340]   And I was like, "Oh, Frank Knight,
[02:40:45.340 --> 02:40:47.360]   "you haven't read Ayn Rand yet."
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:48.200]   - Hold my beer, yeah.
[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:49.240]   - You're a little too early,
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:50.440]   because that's what she does.
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:52.820]   She takes the outcomes of capitalism
[02:40:52.820 --> 02:40:54.640]   and of market competition and says,
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:56.680]   "These have ethical meaning."
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:40:58.960]   And this is where ethical meaning inheres,
[02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:02.480]   and it is ethical to try to succeed
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:04.080]   and to succeed in a capitalist society.
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:07.360]   Now, what she's able to do is create a fictional world
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:10.720]   in which people succeed in her fictional capitalist world
[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:12.520]   through ethical behavior.
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:14.520]   And so she doesn't really have to wrestle
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:17.480]   with a capitalist world in which people succeed
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:21.280]   through fraud and corruption and all the other things
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:23.080]   that might go into someone's success.
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:25.880]   She creates the best possible take
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:27.940]   on success under capitalism,
[02:41:27.940 --> 02:41:29.720]   and then she holds that up as an ideal.
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:31.840]   And I think what's important
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:33.620]   is that so few people have done that,
[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:34.760]   and she comes at a time
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:38.020]   when everybody is emphasizing the downsides of capitalism.
[02:41:38.020 --> 02:41:40.160]   And she says there's another way to look at it.
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:42.200]   Here are the good sides of capitalism.
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:43.800]   - And like you said, she was operating,
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:46.080]   which I really loved the phrasing of that,
[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:48.920]   in the mythic register.
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:49.760]   - Yeah.
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:52.200]   - So she was constructing these characters,
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:56.280]   these capitalists, that are like the highest form,
[02:41:56.280 --> 02:42:00.240]   these great heroic figures, almost romanticizing them.
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:01.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:02.800]   - You mentioned "We the Living"
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:06.640]   as one of the books that you like of hers the most,
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:09.600]   but can we stay in the mythic register
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:12.820]   with "The Fountainhead" and "Alice Shrugged"?
[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:16.860]   What to you are some sort of memorable, inspiring moments,
[02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:20.200]   insightful moments from those books
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:26.040]   that may be scenes or ideas that you take away from them
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:30.760]   that are important for people to understand?
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:32.160]   - Yeah, so "The Fountainhead"
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:37.160]   is this story of a struggling architect, Howard Rourke,
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:40.640]   and she kind of follows his life and his career.
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:42.920]   And the message is really,
[02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:45.960]   it's a version of to thine own self be true, right?
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:49.820]   And Rourke's designs are too avant-garde.
[02:42:49.820 --> 02:42:51.080]   Nobody appreciates him,
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:54.600]   and he just keeps doing what he wants to do,
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:57.960]   and is just focused on his own visions, his own genius.
[02:42:57.960 --> 02:42:59.560]   I think that's been really inspiring
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:01.360]   to kind of creators of all types.
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:03.760]   I think it's barely unrealistic
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:06.040]   as a portrait of human achievement,
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:07.920]   but it's an aspirational idea.
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:10.620]   I mean, one phrase that comes to mind is,
[02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:12.520]   there's a character, I forget which one,
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:15.660]   who is in some sort of adversarial relationship
[02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:17.360]   with Howard Rourke and says something to him like,
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:20.240]   "Well, Mr. Rourke, what do you think of me?"
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:23.440]   And Rourke says, "I don't think of you."
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:25.320]   You know, and that to Rand was the ideal.
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:27.080]   You're not thinking of other people.
[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:29.840]   You're an island unto yourself.
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:32.320]   You know, you're focused on your own goals,
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:33.960]   your own capacities,
[02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:36.560]   and you're not doing it to impress other people,
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:37.940]   or to be better than other people,
[02:43:37.940 --> 02:43:39.120]   or to dominate other people.
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:40.720]   You're doing it 'cause you're sort of expressing
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:43.520]   your inner soul in a way.
[02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:47.360]   So that has been very captivating to so many,
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:48.920]   and "The Fountainhead" is one of those books
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:50.320]   we talked about that causes,
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:51.160]   you know, people read it
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:52.480]   and they make changes in their life,
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:55.320]   or they feel called to their higher self.
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:58.760]   - And I think there's also the scene where Rourke,
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:00.560]   with the Dean of Architecture at the school,
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:02.900]   that's speaking to what you're saying,
[02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:05.280]   I think, to me, is inspiring.
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:09.400]   So this is the Dean of Architecture that expels Rourke,
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:10.880]   and it brings him into a meeting,
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:13.080]   thinking Rourke will plead for a second chance.
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:15.060]   And the Dean says that,
[02:44:15.060 --> 02:44:17.800]   "Rourke's work is contrary to every principle
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:19.140]   "we have tried to teach you,
[02:44:19.140 --> 02:44:22.380]   "contrary to all established precedents
[02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:24.260]   "and traditions of art.
[02:44:24.260 --> 02:44:26.400]   "Do you mean to tell me that you're thinking seriously
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:30.600]   "of building that way when and if you are an architect?"
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:34.680]   And then, in a gangster-like way, Rourke says, "Yes."
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:38.280]   And then Dean asks, "My dear fellow, who will let you?"
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:40.800]   And Rourke replies, "That's not the point.
[02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:44.240]   "The point is, who will stop me?"
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:45.080]   - Yes.
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:47.320]   I mean, you know, "Ran"'s coming from communist Russia,
[02:44:47.320 --> 02:44:49.960]   but it has a bit of the "don't mess with Texas" flavor,
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:51.160]   you know, I might say.
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:52.840]   That really resonates with this idea
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:54.600]   of anyone who's felt like they're, you know,
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:56.160]   fighting the powers that be.
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:44:58.180]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[02:44:58.180 --> 02:45:00.680]   I thought you might be going to a quote
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:04.920]   where he says something like, "I inherit no tradition.
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:07.220]   "You know, I stand at the beginning of one."
[02:45:07.220 --> 02:45:09.400]   And I really think "Ran"'s thinking about herself,
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:10.600]   you know, when she says that,
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:12.840]   that she inherits nothing, she stands at the start.
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:14.880]   But, you know, "The Fountainhead" comes out
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:16.600]   in the middle of World War II,
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:20.520]   and it's not expect, "Ran" is an unknown writer.
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:21.920]   This is kind of a strange book.
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:23.240]   It's, you know, classic story.
[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:25.080]   It's turned down by 12 publishers
[02:45:25.080 --> 02:45:27.240]   before one takes a chance on it.
[02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:29.440]   And "Ran" really loved this story.
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:32.240]   The editor who read it said, "This book is great."
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:33.880]   And his boss said, "No."
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:37.240]   And he said, "If you don't take this book, I'm quitting."
[02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:40.580]   You know, and so she idolized him for doing that.
[02:45:40.580 --> 02:45:43.440]   So they print it, and it becomes a bestseller
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:44.960]   just through word of mouth.
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:46.640]   So it's not advertised, doesn't,
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:47.780]   it gets one good book review,
[02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:51.320]   but people tell each other how much they like this book.
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:53.480]   And it keeps printing and selling out printings.
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:54.600]   It's made into a movie.
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:45:58.000]   And so it lands in this time when Americans are engaged
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.240]   in this great collective endeavor of World War II.
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:03.700]   They're making all kinds of sacrifices for the collective.
[02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:05.600]   And I think paradoxically, as they do that,
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:06.800]   they're drawn to this vision
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:09.440]   of someone who doesn't have to compromise at all,
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:12.480]   you know, who is leading their life exactly as they want to.
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:14.480]   You know, meanwhile, they might be sleeping
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:16.260]   on an ocean liner because they've been drafted
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:18.080]   to fight in this war, and they're reading "The Fountainhead"
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:19.520]   and they're feeling better about themselves.
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:21.520]   And so it's also really interesting.
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:24.400]   "The Fountainhead" is hugely popular in India,
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:25.520]   which is fascinating.
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:27.760]   And, you know, talk to people about this,
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:29.640]   and they basically say,
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:31.960]   "This book comes like a breath of fresh air
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:34.320]   into a very traditional and conformist culture,
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:36.760]   and people just latch onto it, and they love it."
[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:38.200]   You know, and it gives them that feeling
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:40.920]   of freedom and possibility that they're hoping for.
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:43.360]   - Yeah, I mean, it really is a book.
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:45.800]   "Atlas Shrugged" can be a bit of that too,
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:48.800]   but it's more of the philosophy, objectivism,
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:50.200]   and the details and the nuance
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:52.240]   of that seeps into "Atlas Shrugged."
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:55.200]   The Fountainhead is very much like a thing
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:57.800]   that makes you change the path of your life.
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:46:58.640]   - Yeah.
[02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:00.480]   - And that, I mean, that's beautiful to see
[02:47:00.480 --> 02:47:02.600]   that books can have that power.
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:06.720]   - And, you know, Rand knew that she was doing that,
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:08.680]   and she knew what she was doing.
[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:10.440]   You know, this wasn't an accident,
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:12.400]   and people say, "Oh, she's a bad writer.
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:14.480]   Oh, her characters are so heavy-handed."
[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:16.000]   You know, she started as a screenwriter.
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.120]   She started as someone who analyzed films
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:20.200]   for movie studios.
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:23.520]   She knew exactly how to manipulate plot
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:25.440]   and character and drama.
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:28.320]   And she also knew that she was writing, you know,
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:31.200]   people say, "Oh, Rand is for, you know, adolescents.
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:32.600]   Adolescent teenagers love Rand."
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:34.360]   And that's kind of who she was writing for.
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:35.840]   And she said, "You know, I'm writing for people
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:37.040]   as they start out on their life,
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:39.800]   and they're thinking about who they want to be."
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:43.920]   So she's not writing, you know, for the weary middle age.
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:44.960]   She's writing for the young
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:46.360]   who are looking for inspiration.
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:47.880]   - You know, people say that to me sometimes
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:50.280]   about certain books like "Rand,"
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:52.840]   but also about "The Alchemist."
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:55.800]   I know a lot of people for whom "The Alchemist,"
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:47:58.040]   and they're adults, and they're brilliant people,
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:00.440]   "The Alchemist" changed their life.
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:02.720]   And the same can be said about "The Fountainhead."
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:03.560]   - Yeah.
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:07.160]   - I, and I sometimes get criticized
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:09.120]   for using words that are too simple.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:15.240]   I think simple words can have power.
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:18.600]   And the cliche thing sometimes needs to be said.
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:21.360]   And sometimes, if effectively,
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:24.680]   needs to be said in an over-the-top way
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:27.440]   in the mythic register,
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.360]   because that's the thing that resonates with us.
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:30.200]   - Yeah.
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:32.360]   - 'Cause we are like heroes of our own story,
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:34.840]   and we need to hear that message sometimes
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:38.040]   to take the bold step, to take the risk, to take the leap.
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:39.280]   - Yeah, and I mean, the other thing,
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:42.880]   she knew she was doing kind of propaganda in a way.
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:45.200]   She was like, "I'm doing pro-capitalist propaganda."
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:47.120]   She has a degree from the University of Leningrad.
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:49.000]   You know, she's raised up in Soviet Russia.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.720]   She said, "We need to present the case
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:54.200]   "for the other side in the same way."
[02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:56.160]   And that's what she did.
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:48:57.880]   - Why do you think she's so divisive?
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:00.560]   People either love her or hate her.
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:03.240]   - I mean, I think it's because of that purity
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:07.640]   that I'm willing to say, sort of, "You get what you deserve."
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:09.760]   And that kind of lack of charity.
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:12.600]   And part of that in her work
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:14.760]   is because she creates this fictional world
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:17.640]   where she can set everything up just so.
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:22.640]   And so you don't have contingency or accident or bad luck,
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:26.520]   or you don't really have a lot of children.
[02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:27.640]   You don't have handicapped people.
[02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:30.880]   You know, you just have this idealized world.
[02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:33.440]   And I think it's really infuriating
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:35.200]   for people who feel that's so inaccurate.
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:37.640]   How can you be deriving a social theory
[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:39.760]   and philosophy around this?
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:42.440]   And how can you be missing, what seems to many people,
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:45.480]   she's missing the kind of ethical instinct
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:47.920]   or the altruistic or charitable instinct?
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:50.520]   And so they just become enraged at that.
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:53.520]   And they don't want to see anyone go that far.
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:56.240]   And they're outraged that someone went that far,
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:58.840]   did the thing that Frank Knight said no one would do.
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:02.840]   Yeah, it's very unsettling.
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:06.400]   - Would you say that's her main blind spot,
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:07.960]   the main flaw of objectivism
[02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:12.640]   is just how black and white it paints the world?
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:17.640]   Or if not, what would you say are the flaws of objectivism?
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:20.840]   - So, I mean, the big flaw is that it's justified
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:22.280]   through a fictional world.
[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:24.480]   You know, it's not justified
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:26.080]   through reference to the real world.
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:29.580]   You know, it's not empirical in a way, it's not.
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:33.560]   And Rand herself would say that she's not writing
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:37.080]   about things how they are, but how they should be.
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:42.080]   And so that idealism just really undermines
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:46.000]   it as a mechanism to understand
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:47.520]   where we're actually living.
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:50.040]   - And that is a big contrast with Milton Friedman
[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:52.360]   who would focus on how things are
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:54.640]   versus how things should be.
[02:50:54.640 --> 02:50:58.400]   - And then I think it's the problem of elevating rationality
[02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:01.080]   over any other mode of insight or thinking.
[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:02.760]   And so what happens in Rand's life,
[02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:05.360]   and I describe this in some detail in the book,
[02:51:05.360 --> 02:51:09.560]   is she essentially creates a cult of reason around her
[02:51:09.560 --> 02:51:13.360]   and people who are drawn into this cult,
[02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:14.960]   it's called the collective.
[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:17.440]   It's a group of young people in New York City
[02:51:17.440 --> 02:51:20.340]   who are drawn to her work and she's already famous,
[02:51:20.340 --> 02:51:21.640]   but she's writing "Atlas Shrugged"
[02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:25.000]   and so she's sharing drafts of "Atlas Shrugged"
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:26.440]   as she goes along.
[02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:28.600]   And one of the members of the collective
[02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:31.100]   to bring all of this together is Alan Greenspan,
[02:51:31.100 --> 02:51:32.720]   later be head of the Federal Reserve,
[02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:34.720]   and he's incredibly taken with her.
[02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:36.760]   He's one of these people who says,
[02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:38.520]   "I was a narrow technical thinker.
[02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:41.840]   I never thought about ethics or politics or anything bigger
[02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:44.320]   until I met Ayn Rand and she really opened my mind."
[02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:46.800]   So he's part of this tight-knit group.
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:48.320]   But over time, in this tight-knit group,
[02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:50.440]   they think of themselves, we are all individualists.
[02:51:50.440 --> 02:51:52.540]   We're dedicated to individualism and capitalism.
[02:51:52.540 --> 02:51:54.800]   We're different than everybody else.
[02:51:54.800 --> 02:51:58.440]   Over time, they all come to share Ayn Rand's views
[02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:03.440]   and opinions on everything from music to art to clothes.
[02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:05.160]   She gets a dining room table
[02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:07.720]   and a bunch of them get the same dining room table
[02:52:07.720 --> 02:52:10.920]   and it becomes incredibly conformist
[02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:15.060]   because they've all believed they're acting rationally
[02:52:15.060 --> 02:52:16.800]   and they believe that to act rationally
[02:52:16.800 --> 02:52:18.280]   is to agree with Ayn Rand
[02:52:18.280 --> 02:52:20.720]   and they believe there's no other way
[02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:23.400]   to make decisions than rationality.
[02:52:23.400 --> 02:52:26.320]   And so to disagree with her is to be irrational.
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:27.400]   They don't want to be irrational.
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:29.720]   So people get really caught up
[02:52:29.720 --> 02:52:33.800]   in this very damaging cult-like circle around her.
[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:38.800]   - Plus, for a cult of reason, they get awfully emotional
[02:52:38.800 --> 02:52:42.160]   when there's any disagreement with Ayn Rand.
[02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:45.600]   I mean, it's kind of hilarious, it's absurd,
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:50.600]   but it's also beautiful to watch this singular figure.
[02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:54.880]   We've talked about several singular figures in "Like Frank,"
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:59.880]   right, that shakes up the world with her ideas.
[02:52:59.880 --> 02:53:00.840]   - Yeah.
[02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:02.080]   - And of course it would form a cult.
[02:53:02.080 --> 02:53:03.700]   And of course that cult would be full
[02:53:03.700 --> 02:53:05.500]   of contradictions and hypocrisies.
[02:53:05.500 --> 02:53:07.900]   - Yeah, I mean, it's amazing.
[02:53:07.900 --> 02:53:10.000]   So Murray Rothbard, who's a famous anarchist,
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:15.000]   falls into the Ayn Rand cult and then he disagrees
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.720]   and there's some type of show trial
[02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:20.200]   where he's told he's wrong about everything
[02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:23.240]   and then he has a little sort of pseudo-cult of his own.
[02:53:23.240 --> 02:53:26.840]   And two of his cult members switch over to Ayn Rand
[02:53:26.840 --> 02:53:31.840]   and then one of them, to gesture their breaking
[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:35.000]   of their relationship, mails him a dollar bill
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:36.920]   that's been torn in half.
[02:53:36.920 --> 02:53:41.000]   I mean, this is high theatrics, right? (laughs)
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:44.420]   - Okay, sticking on the drama and the theatrics,
[02:53:44.420 --> 02:53:46.660]   who was Nathaniel Brandon?
[02:53:46.660 --> 02:53:47.500]   - Oh, yes.
[02:53:47.500 --> 02:53:50.460]   - Take me through the arc of Ayn Rand's relationship
[02:53:50.460 --> 02:53:54.220]   with Nathaniel Brandon to their dramatic falling out in 1968.
[02:53:54.220 --> 02:53:57.140]   - Yes, so after "The Fountainhead,"
[02:53:57.140 --> 02:53:59.700]   "The Fountainhead" is auctioned to be,
[02:53:59.700 --> 02:54:00.820]   is sold to be a film.
[02:54:00.820 --> 02:54:02.860]   So Ayn Rand moves to Hollywood,
[02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:04.520]   where she's gonna help in the writing of the film.
[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:06.660]   She wants a lot of creative control.
[02:54:06.660 --> 02:54:08.640]   And she's also still working in screenwriting
[02:54:08.640 --> 02:54:09.480]   and things like this.
[02:54:09.480 --> 02:54:13.900]   And so she gets a letter from a Canadian student
[02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:15.860]   who's written to her several times.
[02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:18.520]   And then he writes again and he says, "I'm at UCLA."
[02:54:18.520 --> 02:54:20.500]   And she's like, "Young man, you're so full of error.
[02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:23.620]   Why don't you come visit me and I'll straighten you out?"
[02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:26.460]   So he comes and they have this real meeting of the minds,
[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:27.900]   they talk all night.
[02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:31.020]   He comes again, he brings his girlfriend, she loves him.
[02:54:31.020 --> 02:54:34.180]   And they start this very intense relationship
[02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:37.140]   of spending every weekend at her house, basically.
[02:54:37.140 --> 02:54:38.960]   Staying up all night, talking about ideas.
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:40.420]   He becomes completely converted
[02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:41.960]   to the objectivist worldview.
[02:54:41.960 --> 02:54:45.340]   Rand begins counseling him and his girlfriend
[02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:49.220]   about their relationship, very intense thing.
[02:54:49.220 --> 02:54:51.260]   Then eventually they graduate from college
[02:54:51.260 --> 02:54:54.060]   and they both enroll in a graduate program in Columbia.
[02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:55.500]   And they leave.
[02:54:55.500 --> 02:54:59.360]   And after they've left, Ayn Rand is just bereft.
[02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:01.980]   And within a few months, she packs up her home
[02:55:01.980 --> 02:55:03.500]   and she moves to New York.
[02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:05.420]   Here I am, I like New York better.
[02:55:05.420 --> 02:55:07.740]   And so that becomes the seedbed of the collective.
[02:55:07.740 --> 02:55:10.340]   And the Brandins, they get married.
[02:55:10.340 --> 02:55:12.540]   They change their name to Brandon.
[02:55:12.540 --> 02:55:15.900]   They've never publicly spoken on this,
[02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:20.420]   but many people pointed out it has the word Rand in the name.
[02:55:20.420 --> 02:55:22.540]   So it's some type of acknowledgement
[02:55:22.540 --> 02:55:24.580]   of how important she is to them.
[02:55:24.580 --> 02:55:28.380]   And time goes on and romantic feelings develop
[02:55:28.380 --> 02:55:30.260]   between Ayn Rand and Nathaniel Brandon,
[02:55:30.260 --> 02:55:31.900]   who's some 20 years her junior.
[02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:36.580]   And they discuss them and they realize that rationality
[02:55:36.580 --> 02:55:39.260]   has led them to the conclusion that they should be lovers.
[02:55:39.260 --> 02:55:40.100]   Right.
[02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:41.980]   Right, they've rationally decided this.
[02:55:41.980 --> 02:55:45.500]   But because they're rational, they need the consent
[02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:47.340]   or at least to inform their partners.
[02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:48.220]   They're both married.
[02:55:48.220 --> 02:55:49.180]   They're both married.
[02:55:49.180 --> 02:55:53.640]   So they call a meeting and they obtain the consent
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:56.260]   or maybe simply inform the others
[02:55:56.260 --> 02:55:58.100]   of the rationality of the choice.
[02:55:58.100 --> 02:55:58.940]   And then they say,
[02:55:58.940 --> 02:56:02.620]   but this is only going to be an intellectual relationship,
[02:56:02.620 --> 02:56:04.860]   but we'd like a few hours alone each week.
[02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:06.320]   And we don't wanna be deceptive.
[02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:08.220]   So we want you to know and approve of this.
[02:56:08.220 --> 02:56:10.620]   So the spouses bought into rationality,
[02:56:10.620 --> 02:56:13.940]   know and approve, one thing leads to another.
[02:56:13.940 --> 02:56:17.340]   It becomes a full romantic and sexual relationship.
[02:56:17.340 --> 02:56:19.280]   And although it's open within these four people,
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:21.340]   it is not open more broadly.
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:24.300]   And so in all these meetings of the collective,
[02:56:24.300 --> 02:56:26.980]   Alan Greenspan, all these other people coming up,
[02:56:26.980 --> 02:56:29.300]   drinking coffee all night, talking, talking,
[02:56:29.300 --> 02:56:30.980]   they all know that Nathaniel Brandon
[02:56:30.980 --> 02:56:32.660]   is objectivist number one.
[02:56:32.660 --> 02:56:35.220]   They don't know that there's a romantic
[02:56:35.220 --> 02:56:36.660]   and sexual relationship happening.
[02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:37.940]   It's kept a secret.
[02:56:37.940 --> 02:56:40.580]   And then when Atlas Shrugged comes out,
[02:56:40.580 --> 02:56:42.260]   it's panned by reviewers.
[02:56:42.260 --> 02:56:44.220]   People absolutely hate this book.
[02:56:44.220 --> 02:56:46.860]   And Rand is not Howard Roark.
[02:56:46.860 --> 02:56:48.580]   She falls into a deep depression
[02:56:48.580 --> 02:56:51.340]   because her masterpiece has been rejected.
[02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:55.160]   And so then the romantic relationship ends,
[02:56:55.160 --> 02:56:58.260]   but the close personal relationship continues.
[02:56:58.260 --> 02:56:59.580]   And then over time,
[02:56:59.580 --> 02:57:02.380]   Brandon who's still married to his wife,
[02:57:02.380 --> 02:57:05.240]   begins an affair with another young woman.
[02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:06.080]   And at this point,
[02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:08.900]   he has started the Nathaniel Brandon Institute
[02:57:08.900 --> 02:57:10.760]   to teach objectivism.
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:12.420]   And he's making good money.
[02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:13.740]   He's becoming quite famous.
[02:57:13.740 --> 02:57:14.940]   - She supported the institute.
[02:57:14.940 --> 02:57:15.820]   - She supported it.
[02:57:15.820 --> 02:57:18.780]   And at first it was to help her in her depression.
[02:57:18.780 --> 02:57:21.660]   She said, "The world needs to recognize your genius.
[02:57:21.660 --> 02:57:22.700]   "They missed Atlas Shrugged,
[02:57:22.700 --> 02:57:23.900]   "but I'm going to teach them.
[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:25.540]   "I will bring the message."
[02:57:25.540 --> 02:57:26.900]   And it's very successful.
[02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:28.020]   It becomes its own business.
[02:57:28.020 --> 02:57:28.960]   It has a newsletter.
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:29.940]   It's a whole world.
[02:57:29.940 --> 02:57:32.180]   So that small cult around Ayn Rand
[02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:33.920]   expands to this whole social network.
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:35.500]   And it's very much a piece
[02:57:35.500 --> 02:57:37.380]   with this burgeoning conservative movement,
[02:57:37.380 --> 02:57:40.680]   objectivists are involved in criticizing the draft.
[02:57:40.680 --> 02:57:42.540]   And, you know,
[02:57:42.540 --> 02:57:45.900]   there's kind of a libertarian objectivist world going on.
[02:57:45.900 --> 02:57:47.260]   All of this is happening.
[02:57:47.260 --> 02:57:48.100]   In the meantime,
[02:57:48.100 --> 02:57:50.060]   Nathaniel Brandon has found a new partner
[02:57:50.060 --> 02:57:50.900]   and he does,
[02:57:50.900 --> 02:57:52.020]   but he doesn't tell Ayn Rand this
[02:57:52.020 --> 02:57:53.760]   because he knows she'll be upset.
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:57.080]   And so it goes on for years.
[02:57:57.080 --> 02:58:02.080]   And Ayn Rand knows something is going on,
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:03.680]   but she can't quite figure it out.
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:07.580]   And finally, Barbara Brandon says to Nathaniel Brandon,
[02:58:07.580 --> 02:58:09.580]   "You know, you have to tell her.
[02:58:09.580 --> 02:58:11.680]   "This has just gone on too long."
[02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:14.560]   So she finds out and the whole thing blows up
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:18.520]   and she exiles him and she breaks off contact with him.
[02:58:18.520 --> 02:58:21.160]   And nobody has ever told what happens.
[02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:22.640]   It's called the objectivist schism.
[02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:24.200]   You know, objectivism breaks in two
[02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:25.580]   because some people say,
[02:58:25.580 --> 02:58:28.880]   "How could Ayn Rand do anything wrong?"
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:30.520]   And other people say,
[02:58:30.520 --> 02:58:32.040]   "What is this letter all about?
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:33.600]   "And what did Nathaniel Brandon do
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:35.140]   "and I'm not just gonna take her word for it.
[02:58:35.140 --> 02:58:36.360]   "I need more information."
[02:58:36.360 --> 02:58:38.600]   And then a bunch of people,
[02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:40.040]   I've read all the accounts of this.
[02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:40.880]   A bunch of people are like,
[02:58:40.880 --> 02:58:42.880]   "Okay, they were having an affair."
[02:58:42.880 --> 02:58:44.220]   And a bunch of other people are like,
[02:58:44.220 --> 02:58:45.920]   "No, that couldn't possibly be happening."
[02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:49.520]   You know, and so the whole thing breaks up,
[02:58:49.520 --> 02:58:51.840]   but what I argue in my book is actually
[02:58:51.840 --> 02:58:54.060]   this is to the benefit of Rand's ideas
[02:58:54.060 --> 02:58:58.600]   because Rand herself was so controlling over her ideas.
[02:58:58.600 --> 02:59:02.560]   And now that she steps back from a public role,
[02:59:02.560 --> 02:59:03.960]   you know, objectivism flows
[02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:06.160]   into the student libertarian movement.
[02:59:06.160 --> 02:59:08.120]   Some objectivists become conservatives.
[02:59:08.120 --> 02:59:10.440]   It just kind of spreads out more generally
[02:59:10.440 --> 02:59:13.080]   and you don't have to drink the Kool-Aid.
[02:59:13.080 --> 02:59:14.920]   You don't have to take the official course.
[02:59:14.920 --> 02:59:16.360]   Nathaniel Brandon goes on to be part
[02:59:16.360 --> 02:59:17.760]   of the self-esteem movement,
[02:59:17.760 --> 02:59:20.720]   you know, the human potential movement, California.
[02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:24.720]   And Ayn Rand lives, you know, another 10 years or so,
[02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:27.480]   but she doesn't do major work after that.
[02:59:27.480 --> 02:59:30.440]   - So since we were talking about some of the
[02:59:32.440 --> 02:59:36.840]   although rationalized, some strange sexual partnerships
[02:59:36.840 --> 02:59:39.520]   that there were engagement in,
[02:59:39.520 --> 02:59:41.440]   I have to ask about the Fountainhead
[02:59:41.440 --> 02:59:45.320]   and the quote-unquote "rape scene" in the Fountainhead.
[02:59:45.320 --> 02:59:50.120]   Was she intending to add that there to be controversial?
[02:59:50.120 --> 02:59:52.560]   How are we supposed to read into it?
[02:59:52.560 --> 02:59:55.720]   Is it a glimpse into Ayn Rand's sexuality?
[02:59:55.720 --> 02:59:58.160]   And maybe broadly we can say,
[02:59:58.160 --> 03:00:02.480]   what was her view on sexuality, on sex,
[03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:04.320]   on power dynamics in relationships?
[03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:06.720]   - Yeah, I mean, there's also an objectivist theory
[03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:10.360]   of sexuality that probably the least convincing
[03:00:10.360 --> 03:00:12.200]   of all the parts of objectivism.
[03:00:12.200 --> 03:00:14.160]   And it goes something like,
[03:00:14.160 --> 03:00:19.160]   your sexual desires express your highest values
[03:00:19.160 --> 03:00:23.480]   and they are related in some ways to your rationality,
[03:00:23.480 --> 03:00:25.520]   right, which is also related to your highest values.
[03:00:25.520 --> 03:00:29.920]   So for her, that explained her attraction
[03:00:29.920 --> 03:00:32.720]   to Nathaniel Brandon and Nathaniel Brandon's attraction
[03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:35.720]   to her was a function of their highest values.
[03:00:35.720 --> 03:00:38.040]   And in fact, Brandon imbibed this so deeply
[03:00:38.040 --> 03:00:40.560]   that the fact that he was later drawn sexually
[03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:43.040]   to a woman who was not particularly accomplished
[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:47.760]   but was beautiful, caused him deep anguish and guilt
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:49.400]   for being non-objectivist.
[03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:51.720]   So this is the objectivist theory.
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:55.160]   Then the gender politics are just crazy.
[03:00:55.160 --> 03:00:56.560]   And we have to kind of back up and think,
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:00:58.440]   okay, so who is Ayn Rand?
[03:00:58.440 --> 03:01:01.280]   She's born in Elisa Rosenbaum in Russia.
[03:01:01.280 --> 03:01:03.920]   She is someone who stands out from the crowd
[03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:04.760]   from the beginning.
[03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:06.760]   She never really fits in.
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:08.560]   She's not conventionally beautiful
[03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:10.120]   by any stretch of the imagination.
[03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:11.440]   She struggles with her weight
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:14.800]   and she doesn't consider herself to have a beautiful face.
[03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:16.720]   She's very independent.
[03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:18.600]   She meets none of the metrics
[03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:20.720]   of traditional femininity at all.
[03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:23.680]   She finds love with a man who is very handsome
[03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:27.920]   but very passive, yet she writes in all her fiction
[03:01:27.920 --> 03:01:30.120]   about strong manly heroes.
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:32.520]   So this seems to be like a projection.
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:35.680]   The man she's actually with is not a strong manly hero.
[03:01:35.680 --> 03:01:37.080]   The hero she writes about,
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:38.760]   she probably wouldn't be able to be in the same room
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:40.040]   with them for more than one minute
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:42.760]   before they got in a raging argument, right?
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:47.120]   And then she develops this theory about women and men
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:51.560]   in that a woman should worship her man
[03:01:51.560 --> 03:01:54.680]   and a woman finds her true expression
[03:01:54.680 --> 03:01:56.800]   in worshiping the man she's with.
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:01:59.720]   So again, this is not at all how Ayn Rand lives her life.
[03:01:59.720 --> 03:02:04.040]   This is like this, I would say, compensatory theory
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:06.720]   for her lack of ability to conform
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:09.000]   to the gender norms of her day.
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:13.360]   She then articulates them in a very strong
[03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:16.880]   and almost distorted and exaggerated way to compensate
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:18.840]   for the fact that she doesn't actually meet them,
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:20.200]   can't actually enact them.
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:24.920]   The rape scene to some degree embodies that idea
[03:02:24.920 --> 03:02:29.920]   that to some degree that the woman should worship the man.
[03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:33.600]   I tend to read it more in terms of literary genre.
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:38.600]   So Rand is a screenwriter, a consumer of movies,
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:44.240]   and that rape scene is like paradigmatic
[03:02:44.240 --> 03:02:46.440]   for the romance genre.
[03:02:46.440 --> 03:02:49.480]   In other words, these like pulpy romance novels
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:52.720]   where the hero rapes the heroine
[03:02:52.720 --> 03:02:53.680]   and then they fall in love.
[03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:55.720]   That's just the trope of how it works.
[03:02:55.720 --> 03:02:57.600]   So it's crazy when you read it,
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:03:00.600]   but if you were reading a bunch of novels in this genre,
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:03.760]   you would find this is like very standard.
[03:03:03.760 --> 03:03:07.240]   And so, but that is a huge part of his appeal at the time.
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:11.160]   There's this feminist who hates Rand, Susan Brownmiller,
[03:03:11.160 --> 03:03:13.560]   and she wants to write an angry denunciation
[03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:14.440]   of the rape scene.
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:16.680]   So she goes to get the fountainhead and she's wondering
[03:03:16.680 --> 03:03:20.640]   how is she ever gonna find the scene in this 800-page book.
[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:22.840]   It's a library copy 'cause she doesn't wanna buy it.
[03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:25.560]   And it just falls open to the rape scene
[03:03:25.560 --> 03:03:27.080]   because everybody's gone and read it
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:30.360]   because it's very racy and explicit for that time.
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:33.520]   So I'm almost positive she also knew that.
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:37.120]   Like if I put in this kind of taboo-breaking sex scene,
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:39.000]   that's also gonna probably be why people
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:40.000]   tell their friends about it.
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.280]   So I just, I think it's a mess.
[03:03:42.280 --> 03:03:45.680]   I think all of the gender and sexuality stuff
[03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:49.920]   is that she states is just a total mess.
[03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:53.680]   - I think it also reminds me of another guy related,
[03:03:53.680 --> 03:03:58.120]   Friedrich Nietzsche, who had very strong opinions on women
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:04:02.600]   and wrote about what women's role in society should be
[03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:05.160]   and different power dynamics and relationships
[03:04:05.160 --> 03:04:07.320]   and all that kind of stuff when he himself
[03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:09.080]   really had trouble getting laid.
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:09.920]   - Yeah.
[03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:14.240]   - And so you have to sort of always maybe chuckle
[03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:17.600]   or take with a grain of salt the analysis
[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:19.840]   of power dynamics and relationship from these figures
[03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:24.640]   which failed in many regards in their own private life.
[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:27.840]   You mentioned feminists.
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:30.600]   Would you consider Ayn Rand a feminist?
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:32.560]   - I mean, she's almost an anti-feminist
[03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:38.920]   because she then goes on and someone writes her a letter
[03:04:38.920 --> 03:04:43.200]   about like, should there be a female president or something?
[03:04:43.200 --> 03:04:44.760]   This is like the beginning of feminism.
[03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:49.760]   And she says, "No, no woman should ever be president
[03:04:49.760 --> 03:04:53.120]   "because if she's president,
[03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:55.460]   "she wouldn't be able to look up to any man
[03:04:55.460 --> 03:04:56.840]   "because she would be so powerful
[03:04:56.840 --> 03:04:58.400]   "and therefore she would be like corrupt
[03:04:58.400 --> 03:05:01.360]   "and like rotten in the soul and like unfit to be a leader."
[03:05:01.360 --> 03:05:04.480]   And it just makes no sense.
[03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:06.120]   - But that said, she's a woman
[03:05:06.120 --> 03:05:07.600]   and she's one of the most powerful intellects
[03:05:07.600 --> 03:05:08.840]   in the 20th century.
[03:05:08.840 --> 03:05:09.680]   - Yeah.
[03:05:09.680 --> 03:05:12.200]   - And so it's the contradictions.
[03:05:12.200 --> 03:05:15.620]   I mean, Nietzsche is full of contradictions of this sort.
[03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:20.620]   That the very fact that she's one of the most powerful minds
[03:05:20.620 --> 03:05:26.160]   in history to me means that she is a feminist
[03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:30.240]   in the spirit she embodies, right?
[03:05:30.240 --> 03:05:31.320]   In what she represents.
[03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:34.560]   - I mean, she lived the ideals of individualism in her life
[03:05:34.560 --> 03:05:37.000]   and set aside gender norms in her own life,
[03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.840]   but she did not see herself as part of any,
[03:05:39.840 --> 03:05:41.760]   she did not see herself as doing this
[03:05:41.760 --> 03:05:43.520]   for the benefit of other women
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:46.680]   or to change society's views about women.
[03:05:46.680 --> 03:05:48.480]   There was no collective essence to it.
[03:05:48.480 --> 03:05:53.480]   So if feminism has some sort of collective aspect to it
[03:05:53.480 --> 03:05:57.520]   or at least some identification,
[03:05:57.520 --> 03:06:00.240]   one needs to identify with a broader category of woman
[03:06:00.240 --> 03:06:01.880]   and feel their acting in behalf of that.
[03:06:01.880 --> 03:06:03.840]   She's definitely not doing that.
[03:06:03.840 --> 03:06:06.720]   And she did, you know,
[03:06:06.760 --> 03:06:10.200]   she was fair to women in her life,
[03:06:10.200 --> 03:06:11.520]   promoted them in her life,
[03:06:11.520 --> 03:06:14.960]   but did not, I mean, she was very negative about feminism.
[03:06:14.960 --> 03:06:18.080]   And then because like they dress terribly, you know?
[03:06:18.080 --> 03:06:20.160]   And then the other thing, it's really interesting.
[03:06:20.160 --> 03:06:22.880]   She had, there's all these kinds of homoerotic themes
[03:06:22.880 --> 03:06:24.280]   in her writing.
[03:06:24.280 --> 03:06:28.960]   And for that reason, many gay men were drawn to her writing.
[03:06:28.960 --> 03:06:29.920]   And then she would say like,
[03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:32.080]   "Homosexuals are dirty, terrible people."
[03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:34.800]   You know, she would denounce people for being homosexual.
[03:06:34.800 --> 03:06:37.000]   So there's a whole actual literature of like gay men
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:40.080]   wrestling with Rand and how she,
[03:06:40.080 --> 03:06:42.120]   like what she says about gay people.
[03:06:42.120 --> 03:06:45.720]   So yeah, it's hard to make sense of.
[03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:49.240]   And I just think of the enormous pressures.
[03:06:49.240 --> 03:06:50.080]   I wanna be charitable.
[03:06:50.080 --> 03:06:52.600]   I just think of the enormous pressure she was under
[03:06:52.600 --> 03:06:54.000]   in the culture she was raised in,
[03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.200]   the expectations that were placed upon her
[03:06:56.200 --> 03:06:59.040]   and her just utter inability to meet any of them.
[03:06:59.040 --> 03:07:02.600]   And it came out in this very tortured set of ideals
[03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:03.960]   that she tried to promote.
[03:07:04.840 --> 03:07:09.480]   And this kind of lack of ability to introspect in herself
[03:07:09.480 --> 03:07:12.960]   and to, it was probably too painful to introspect
[03:07:12.960 --> 03:07:13.920]   and to think about that.
[03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:18.360]   So she just tried to rationalize her way through it.
[03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:21.440]   And it came out in these very strange theories.
[03:07:21.440 --> 03:07:24.280]   - Why do you think that Ayn Rand is,
[03:07:24.280 --> 03:07:27.200]   maybe you can correct me, but as far as I can see,
[03:07:27.200 --> 03:07:29.840]   never mentioned in the list of great thinkers in history
[03:07:29.840 --> 03:07:32.280]   or even the great thinkers of the 20th century,
[03:07:32.280 --> 03:07:36.080]   or even the great female thinkers of the 20th century.
[03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:41.080]   So you have somebody like Simone de Beauvoir, Hannah Arend.
[03:07:41.080 --> 03:07:42.920]   I almost never see her in the list.
[03:07:42.920 --> 03:07:47.920]   If you Google those silly lists, top, whatever,
[03:07:47.920 --> 03:07:50.920]   top thinkers of the 20th century, she's not mentioned.
[03:07:50.920 --> 03:07:52.040]   Why is that?
[03:07:52.040 --> 03:07:54.960]   - You know, a lot of people just deeply dislike Rand.
[03:07:54.960 --> 03:07:56.680]   They deeply dislike her ideas
[03:07:56.680 --> 03:07:58.640]   and they don't think they're profound
[03:07:58.640 --> 03:08:02.320]   because they're disconnection from other ideas
[03:08:02.320 --> 03:08:04.560]   and other understandings of human society.
[03:08:04.560 --> 03:08:07.800]   I think where you could look at them and say,
[03:08:07.800 --> 03:08:11.720]   these ideas are very provocative and they're very deep
[03:08:11.720 --> 03:08:13.880]   'cause she's not taking anything for granted
[03:08:13.880 --> 03:08:15.520]   and she's flipping everything around
[03:08:15.520 --> 03:08:17.640]   and forcing you to really think.
[03:08:17.640 --> 03:08:20.120]   To a lot of other readers, to her critics,
[03:08:20.120 --> 03:08:21.600]   they just look absurd.
[03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:24.040]   Like, how could you even make these contentions?
[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:29.640]   And I think that because she's not without precedence
[03:08:29.640 --> 03:08:31.040]   and she's not without followers,
[03:08:31.040 --> 03:08:35.120]   but she doesn't knit herself into an intellectual community
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:39.840]   the way that these other thinkers do very naturally,
[03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:42.720]   that you can see who they influence,
[03:08:42.720 --> 03:08:45.040]   you can see who they're in dialogue with.
[03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:47.400]   You know, I think my book was one of the first
[03:08:47.400 --> 03:08:48.920]   to really take Rand and say,
[03:08:48.920 --> 03:08:50.760]   she's a figure in American history.
[03:08:50.760 --> 03:08:52.280]   Here's who she's connected to.
[03:08:52.280 --> 03:08:54.280]   Here's who she's influenced.
[03:08:54.280 --> 03:08:56.360]   And I got a lot of pushback for that.
[03:08:56.360 --> 03:09:00.160]   You know, I think now people are more open to it.
[03:09:00.160 --> 03:09:02.600]   But I think the people who compile these lists
[03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:04.960]   really dislike her work.
[03:09:04.960 --> 03:09:06.440]   And they think it's shallow
[03:09:06.440 --> 03:09:10.760]   because they find her fiction overdrawn.
[03:09:10.760 --> 03:09:13.960]   They find her work in the mythic register simple.
[03:09:13.960 --> 03:09:17.560]   And she's also a grand systematic thinker
[03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:19.680]   in an age that's over systems.
[03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:20.760]   You know, she's almost,
[03:09:20.760 --> 03:09:23.280]   she's creating an inverse Marxism, right?
[03:09:23.280 --> 03:09:25.160]   Marx was writing in 1848.
[03:09:25.160 --> 03:09:28.440]   You know, he's not a thinker of the mid 20th century.
[03:09:28.440 --> 03:09:31.000]   So I think that's part of it.
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:32.200]   The lack of a legacy
[03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:34.240]   and the dislike of what she had to say
[03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:36.760]   and the feeling that she's too detached.
[03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:38.240]   Her insights are not insights
[03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:40.040]   because they're too idealized
[03:09:40.040 --> 03:09:43.520]   rather than being rooted in a theory of human nature
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:44.880]   that people find plausible.
[03:09:44.880 --> 03:09:51.200]   - You study and write about history of ideas
[03:09:51.200 --> 03:09:53.480]   in the United States over the past 100 years,
[03:09:53.480 --> 03:09:54.480]   100 plus years.
[03:09:54.480 --> 03:09:59.320]   How do you think ideas evolve and gain power
[03:09:59.320 --> 03:10:04.320]   over the populace, over our government, over culture?
[03:10:04.320 --> 03:10:06.680]   Just looking at evolution of ideas
[03:10:06.680 --> 03:10:08.840]   as they dance and challenge each other
[03:10:08.840 --> 03:10:13.320]   and play in public discourse.
[03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:16.440]   What do you think is the mechanism
[03:10:16.440 --> 03:10:19.280]   by which they take hold and have influence?
[03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:22.160]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a couple of different ways
[03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:24.160]   I think it happens.
[03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:27.560]   I really am interested in the relationship
[03:10:27.560 --> 03:10:31.400]   between the thinker and then the reader
[03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:33.960]   and the interpreter of the ideas
[03:10:33.960 --> 03:10:36.360]   and then the conditions on the ground
[03:10:36.360 --> 03:10:39.280]   that make that idea resonate or not resonate.
[03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:44.040]   And so I think a lot,
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:46.040]   so as an intellectual historian,
[03:10:46.040 --> 03:10:48.000]   I'm studying ideas and I'm always putting them
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:49.280]   in their historical context.
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:52.360]   Like what is happening that is making these things resonate,
[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:55.120]   that is making them, people seek them out.
[03:10:55.120 --> 03:10:59.080]   So for Ran's case, she has this credibility
[03:10:59.080 --> 03:11:01.200]   because of her experience of communism,
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:04.800]   which is one of these defining moments of the time.
[03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:08.080]   And then I think the idea comes out in a sort of pure form
[03:11:08.080 --> 03:11:10.000]   and then other people rework it
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:11.920]   and reshape it as they read it.
[03:11:11.920 --> 03:11:14.400]   And I'm really interested in how people form communities
[03:11:14.400 --> 03:11:15.360]   around these ideas.
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:19.240]   So a bunch of people started calling themselves objectivists
[03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:22.120]   and getting together to read Ran's work.
[03:11:22.120 --> 03:11:24.880]   That was spontaneous and ground up
[03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:27.680]   and wasn't supported by any money.
[03:11:27.680 --> 03:11:29.680]   Nobody planned it, it just happened.
[03:11:29.680 --> 03:11:31.760]   Friedman's a different case in that he joins
[03:11:31.760 --> 03:11:33.440]   an established tradition of thought
[03:11:33.440 --> 03:11:35.880]   that's been institutionalized in universities.
[03:11:35.880 --> 03:11:38.000]   So people are signing up and paying money
[03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:40.320]   and getting credential to learn these ideas.
[03:11:40.320 --> 03:11:42.720]   So to my mind, these are two different ways,
[03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:46.320]   but really emblematic ways of how ideas spread.
[03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:48.480]   So Ran, I think of those more bottom up,
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:51.040]   like people encounter the idea in a book,
[03:11:51.040 --> 03:11:52.360]   they're kind of blown away by it
[03:11:52.360 --> 03:11:54.400]   or they imbibe it without even realizing
[03:11:54.400 --> 03:11:55.280]   they're imbibing it.
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:56.120]   And then they're like,
[03:11:56.120 --> 03:11:58.160]   well, maybe I don't like Franklin Roosevelt so much,
[03:11:58.160 --> 03:12:01.800]   or maybe I'll look another time at Barry Goldwater.
[03:12:01.800 --> 03:12:05.600]   And then whereas Friedman, you get the idea more top down,
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:06.840]   I know I'm getting the idea,
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:08.120]   I know I'm being positioned
[03:12:08.120 --> 03:12:11.200]   within a sort of elite discourse of economics.
[03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:13.840]   And so I think they kind of go top down and bottom up
[03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:16.320]   and then they hit the events, right?
[03:12:16.320 --> 03:12:18.560]   Friedman's ideas wouldn't have gone anywhere
[03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:21.400]   without that episode of stagflation
[03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:24.080]   that really made people think they proved out.
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:26.560]   And I think Ran's ideas really caught fire
[03:12:26.560 --> 03:12:29.360]   in Cold War America that's looking for a statement of like,
[03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:31.680]   what does it mean to be an individual?
[03:12:31.680 --> 03:12:34.240]   What does it mean to live in this mass society?
[03:12:34.240 --> 03:12:37.320]   Because it's also a time of great social conformity
[03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:38.720]   and where people are suddenly,
[03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:40.840]   they're working for large corporations.
[03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:44.000]   They've been served in a large military.
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:47.520]   The United States is stepping out onto the world stage.
[03:12:47.520 --> 03:12:48.360]   Everything is bigger.
[03:12:48.360 --> 03:12:50.120]   What does it mean to be an individual in that world?
[03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:52.440]   And that's where Ran's ideas catch fire.
[03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:54.560]   So I think a lot about that,
[03:12:54.560 --> 03:12:56.600]   about how they trickle through different levels of society
[03:12:56.600 --> 03:12:59.480]   and then how ideas collide with experience,
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:00.480]   I think is critical.
[03:13:00.480 --> 03:13:01.560]   - What do you think about like
[03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:04.400]   when they actually take power in government?
[03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:07.640]   So I think about ideas like Marxism
[03:13:07.640 --> 03:13:11.760]   and how that evolves into the Bolshevik Revolution
[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:14.520]   and how that like takes hold in its implementations.
[03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:18.000]   Or you can think about Nazism and with Hitler
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:21.120]   where it goes from a small number of people
[03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:22.640]   that get real excited about a thing
[03:13:22.640 --> 03:13:25.680]   and then like somehow just becomes viral
[03:13:25.680 --> 03:13:30.520]   and takes hold in power and then that has its consequences.
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:35.520]   - When I think about this sort of historical path
[03:13:35.560 --> 03:13:37.160]   of communism and the kind of logics
[03:13:37.160 --> 03:13:39.480]   and dynamics of communism,
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:43.840]   I mean, in many ways it has some echoes with Ran
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:47.480]   in that the ideology in its purest form
[03:13:47.480 --> 03:13:50.480]   is almost, it's a rationalist ideology of some ways.
[03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:51.760]   It's an analysis of history
[03:13:51.760 --> 03:13:52.880]   and how things are supposed to be.
[03:13:52.880 --> 03:13:55.000]   And I think you mentioned Hannah Arendt.
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.960]   I think she is one of the most kind of penetrating analyses
[03:13:57.960 --> 03:14:01.200]   of communism, which she really puts in the category
[03:14:01.200 --> 03:14:04.680]   of like it's a logical ideology.
[03:14:04.680 --> 03:14:07.360]   Logic leads inexorably to its conclusions
[03:14:07.360 --> 03:14:10.840]   and then experience crops up and experience is different.
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:14.640]   And what is a sort of cult of rationality do
[03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:15.720]   when it hits experience?
[03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:18.400]   Well, it tries to bend experience to its will.
[03:14:18.400 --> 03:14:20.560]   And that I think is really the story
[03:14:20.560 --> 03:14:22.520]   of communism writ large.
[03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:28.560]   So the question though is why does it catch fire?
[03:14:28.560 --> 03:14:31.320]   Why does it draw people into political allegiance?
[03:14:31.320 --> 03:14:33.040]   I think in the case of communism,
[03:14:33.040 --> 03:14:36.680]   it's this dream of a more ethical world,
[03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:39.800]   dream of equality, dream of the powerless rising up
[03:14:39.800 --> 03:14:40.720]   against the powerful.
[03:14:40.720 --> 03:14:44.120]   I mean, that's drawn in so many.
[03:14:44.120 --> 03:14:48.120]   And then you had the whole addition of Leninism,
[03:14:48.120 --> 03:14:50.680]   which gave a kind of international cast to that
[03:14:50.680 --> 03:14:53.600]   and helped people think about what are the relations
[03:14:53.600 --> 03:14:55.320]   between poorer and richer countries
[03:14:55.320 --> 03:14:57.480]   and what can we expect out of them and what might happen,
[03:14:57.480 --> 03:15:00.240]   gave a sort of a framework for thinking about that
[03:15:00.320 --> 03:15:04.080]   in a time when the world was becoming more interconnected
[03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:06.520]   and those differences were becoming more obvious.
[03:15:06.520 --> 03:15:12.640]   Fascism to me is unleashing more something primal,
[03:15:12.640 --> 03:15:16.800]   something sort of dark and primal within people.
[03:15:16.800 --> 03:15:21.520]   And it's more a permission structure to indulge in that
[03:15:21.520 --> 03:15:23.120]   that is normally not there.
[03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:25.520]   Those impulses are normally channeled or held down.
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:28.680]   And it seems that when the fascist regimes come into power,
[03:15:28.680 --> 03:15:32.560]   they give people permission to let those forces out.
[03:15:32.560 --> 03:15:33.800]   - I think on communism,
[03:15:33.800 --> 03:15:37.880]   going back to that lecture that Ayn Rand gave,
[03:15:37.880 --> 03:15:41.600]   I think what rings true to me a little bit
[03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:45.000]   is that what fuels it is a kind of,
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.720]   maybe not resentment, but envy
[03:15:47.720 --> 03:15:53.880]   towards the people that have nots versus the haves.
[03:15:53.880 --> 03:15:56.560]   And there is some degree to which Nazism has the same
[03:15:56.560 --> 03:15:58.680]   kind of envy towards some group,
[03:15:58.680 --> 03:16:00.320]   resentment towards some group.
[03:16:00.320 --> 03:16:03.840]   So it's given the environment of hard times,
[03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:05.760]   hard economic times,
[03:16:05.760 --> 03:16:09.360]   combined with the more primal just envy
[03:16:09.360 --> 03:16:12.840]   of not having and seeing somebody who has it
[03:16:12.840 --> 03:16:16.000]   and just constructing a narrative around that,
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:19.240]   that can become a real viral idea.
[03:16:19.240 --> 03:16:22.120]   - Yeah, it seems like communism is more animated
[03:16:22.120 --> 03:16:23.680]   by this idea of injustice.
[03:16:23.680 --> 03:16:25.080]   You know, the world is unjust.
[03:16:25.080 --> 03:16:26.520]   It should be different.
[03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:30.880]   And fascism seems like the process of scapegoating, right?
[03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:34.240]   We've identified the source of the problem
[03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:36.160]   and it's this group.
[03:16:36.160 --> 03:16:38.520]   And they need to be punished
[03:16:38.520 --> 03:16:40.560]   for what they've done to the rest of us.
[03:16:40.560 --> 03:16:44.960]   - There is a primal thing going back to literature in 1984,
[03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:46.560]   two minutes of hate,
[03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:49.360]   where you can get everybody real excited
[03:16:49.360 --> 03:16:51.680]   about hating a thing.
[03:16:51.680 --> 03:16:55.000]   And there's something primal about us humans
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:58.040]   where you, once you're in that state of hate,
[03:16:58.040 --> 03:17:01.920]   anyone can direct that hate towards anything.
[03:17:01.920 --> 03:17:02.760]   - Yeah.
[03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:05.960]   - Towards, yeah, towards any group,
[03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:08.320]   towards any idea, towards anything,
[03:17:08.320 --> 03:17:10.120]   'cause we could get caught up
[03:17:10.120 --> 03:17:12.640]   in the mass hysteria of the hatred.
[03:17:12.640 --> 03:17:14.040]   It's a dangerous thing.
[03:17:14.040 --> 03:17:15.440]   - Yeah.
[03:17:15.440 --> 03:17:19.320]   - You floated the idea, I forget where,
[03:17:19.320 --> 03:17:22.160]   of pivoting for your next book
[03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:26.360]   towards maybe writing about postmodernism,
[03:17:26.360 --> 03:17:28.960]   which is a set of ideas
[03:17:28.960 --> 03:17:30.960]   almost the opposite of Ayn Rand's philosophy.
[03:17:30.960 --> 03:17:34.800]   So can you maybe explain your curiosity
[03:17:34.800 --> 03:17:37.280]   about, first of all, spaces of ideas,
[03:17:37.280 --> 03:17:40.600]   but maybe postmodernism?
[03:17:40.600 --> 03:17:43.120]   - Yeah, I mean, I think in the broadest sense,
[03:17:43.120 --> 03:17:44.720]   what I'm interested in,
[03:17:44.720 --> 03:17:46.880]   kind of two dimensions that guide me
[03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:48.360]   in doing intellectual history.
[03:17:48.360 --> 03:17:49.280]   One is what I talked about,
[03:17:49.360 --> 03:17:52.680]   like how does an idea go from a book,
[03:17:52.680 --> 03:17:56.200]   an elite space, out to more popular dimensions?
[03:17:56.200 --> 03:17:57.200]   Like how does that happen?
[03:17:57.200 --> 03:17:58.680]   What happens to the idea along the way?
[03:17:58.680 --> 03:18:00.440]   How is it distorted or changed?
[03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:02.360]   And the other is just search for meaning
[03:18:02.360 --> 03:18:05.440]   in a post-Christian era or a secular era.
[03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:07.960]   Like what are people coming up with?
[03:18:07.960 --> 03:18:11.520]   And I think to replace that void
[03:18:11.520 --> 03:18:13.120]   in their religious or spiritual lives,
[03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:15.080]   I think both Rand and Friedman
[03:18:15.080 --> 03:18:16.960]   offered these sort of alternatives, right?
[03:18:16.960 --> 03:18:20.160]   Objectivism, quasi-rationalist religion.
[03:18:20.160 --> 03:18:25.080]   People take economics as a theory of the world
[03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:27.960]   that you can almost believe in it, right?
[03:18:27.960 --> 03:18:29.400]   It can almost take that place.
[03:18:29.400 --> 03:18:31.560]   And in both cases, how do those ideas travel?
[03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:33.640]   When I think about postmodernism,
[03:18:33.640 --> 03:18:35.160]   you know, it first struck me,
[03:18:35.160 --> 03:18:39.040]   if you read the original "Postmodern Thinkers,"
[03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:40.280]   it's really tough going.
[03:18:40.280 --> 03:18:42.760]   I mean, I make my students do it and they suffer.
[03:18:42.760 --> 03:18:44.160]   I think they see it's worthwhile,
[03:18:44.160 --> 03:18:46.840]   but it's no fun to read Derrida, you know?
[03:18:46.840 --> 03:18:49.720]   But somehow it's trickled down into,
[03:18:49.720 --> 03:18:52.200]   how do we go from like Derrida to Tumblr?
[03:18:52.200 --> 03:18:53.560]   And I sort of realized like,
[03:18:53.560 --> 03:18:55.680]   oh, this has happened with postmodernism.
[03:18:55.680 --> 03:18:58.440]   It's followed the same path, you know,
[03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:01.360]   that say from Milton Friedman's economic theory
[03:19:01.360 --> 03:19:03.120]   to, you know, free to choose on YouTube.
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:04.680]   We've had a similar path of, you know,
[03:19:04.680 --> 03:19:07.320]   high French theory down to Tumblr.
[03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:09.480]   And, you know, I, you know,
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:11.400]   sexually identify as an attack helicopter
[03:19:11.400 --> 03:19:12.440]   or whatever it may be, you know?
[03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:15.640]   And so that was really interesting.
[03:19:15.640 --> 03:19:17.120]   And then I also thought, you know,
[03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:19.920]   well, at the same time,
[03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:22.200]   this is clearly a structure of meaning.
[03:19:22.200 --> 03:19:24.240]   And I actually think it's followed
[03:19:24.240 --> 03:19:26.040]   the same path of objectivism,
[03:19:26.040 --> 03:19:28.600]   which is turning into its opposite,
[03:19:28.600 --> 03:19:31.040]   like distilled down and then turning into its opposite.
[03:19:31.040 --> 03:19:33.760]   So if objectivism was a group of people
[03:19:33.760 --> 03:19:35.520]   who considered themselves individualist,
[03:19:35.520 --> 03:19:37.480]   who ended up deeply conforming
[03:19:37.480 --> 03:19:39.880]   to the dictates of a charismatic leader,
[03:19:39.880 --> 03:19:43.400]   you know, postmodernism started about disrupting binaries.
[03:19:43.400 --> 03:19:45.440]   That was, we're gonna be fluid.
[03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:46.600]   We're gonna go beyond the border.
[03:19:46.600 --> 03:19:48.680]   We're gonna disrupt the binary.
[03:19:48.680 --> 03:19:50.840]   And it's devolved in its popular forms
[03:19:50.840 --> 03:19:53.920]   to the reinscribing of many different binaries.
[03:19:53.920 --> 03:19:56.120]   Oppressor and oppressed, you know,
[03:19:56.120 --> 03:19:58.480]   has become this like paradigmatic set of glasses
[03:19:58.480 --> 03:20:00.400]   you put on to understand the world.
[03:20:00.400 --> 03:20:02.760]   So I think the dynamics are very, very similar.
[03:20:02.760 --> 03:20:05.400]   So I think it's something in the traffic of the idea
[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:09.160]   from its pure form to its popular form,
[03:20:09.160 --> 03:20:11.200]   and then how it gets politicized
[03:20:11.200 --> 03:20:12.520]   or mobilized in different ways.
[03:20:12.520 --> 03:20:13.360]   And behind it all,
[03:20:13.360 --> 03:20:16.200]   I think, is this human longing for meaning
[03:20:16.200 --> 03:20:19.200]   and the inadequacy of the traditional ways
[03:20:19.200 --> 03:20:22.240]   that need was met at this point in time.
[03:20:22.240 --> 03:20:25.660]   - By the way, that going from pure form to popular form,
[03:20:25.660 --> 03:20:28.440]   I remember, this might be before the internet,
[03:20:28.440 --> 03:20:32.360]   but when I was in college reading Derrida and Foucault,
[03:20:32.360 --> 03:20:35.560]   and like not knowing context at all,
[03:20:35.560 --> 03:20:36.720]   it was just interesting.
[03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:38.200]   All right, this is,
[03:20:38.200 --> 03:20:41.880]   like I'm able to read pure encapsulations of an idea
[03:20:41.880 --> 03:20:43.200]   and just kind of like, oh, all right,
[03:20:43.200 --> 03:20:45.400]   well, that person believes that,
[03:20:45.400 --> 03:20:46.680]   and you just kind of hold it.
[03:20:46.680 --> 03:20:48.080]   But then you realize,
[03:20:48.080 --> 03:20:50.480]   if you actually take the pure form of that idea
[03:20:50.480 --> 03:20:52.480]   and then it creates a community around it,
[03:20:52.480 --> 03:20:54.960]   you realize like what that actually becomes.
[03:20:54.960 --> 03:20:57.060]   And you're like, oh yeah, no, I don't.
[03:20:57.060 --> 03:21:02.520]   That's not, although I do consider myself sexually
[03:21:02.520 --> 03:21:04.160]   an attack cop after, that's it.
[03:21:04.160 --> 03:21:06.340]   Identify sexually, yes, beautiful.
[03:21:06.340 --> 03:21:07.180]   Okay.
[03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:13.400]   - Your process of researching for,
[03:21:13.400 --> 03:21:16.440]   let's say the biographies of Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand
[03:21:16.440 --> 03:21:20.040]   seems like an insane amount of work.
[03:21:20.040 --> 03:21:20.880]   - Yeah.
[03:21:20.880 --> 03:21:22.800]   - You did incredible work there
[03:21:22.800 --> 03:21:25.420]   going to the original sources.
[03:21:25.420 --> 03:21:27.160]   Can you maybe speak to that,
[03:21:27.160 --> 03:21:30.560]   what is required to persevere
[03:21:30.560 --> 03:21:35.020]   and to go for so many years,
[03:21:35.020 --> 03:21:37.560]   to go so deep to the sources?
[03:21:38.160 --> 03:21:40.840]   - So, I mean, I go to the archive.
[03:21:40.840 --> 03:21:42.920]   That's where I feel like I'm,
[03:21:42.920 --> 03:21:45.520]   I feel like I'm communing with the dead in some ways.
[03:21:45.520 --> 03:21:48.360]   I'm seeing what they saw in some ways,
[03:21:48.360 --> 03:21:49.960]   reading what they felt.
[03:21:49.960 --> 03:21:53.240]   And I tell my doctoral students,
[03:21:53.240 --> 03:21:54.680]   it's gotta be something that gets you out of bed
[03:21:54.680 --> 03:21:57.220]   in the morning because there comes a point
[03:21:57.220 --> 03:21:59.680]   in your doctoral career when nobody's,
[03:21:59.680 --> 03:22:01.820]   there's nowhere to go, there's nowhere to be.
[03:22:01.820 --> 03:22:02.660]   You gotta be getting up
[03:22:02.660 --> 03:22:04.280]   'cause you're interested in what you wanna study.
[03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:06.560]   And so with Rand, it was this real sense of discovery.
[03:22:06.560 --> 03:22:09.040]   Like I am discovering, I wanna know about this woman,
[03:22:09.040 --> 03:22:10.720]   I wanna know where she fits.
[03:22:10.720 --> 03:22:13.560]   And the only way to find out is to do the research.
[03:22:13.560 --> 03:22:18.560]   And so, yeah, I just, I like to go deep.
[03:22:18.560 --> 03:22:20.500]   It's really interesting to me.
[03:22:20.500 --> 03:22:23.320]   And I should say in both of these cases,
[03:22:23.320 --> 03:22:25.240]   I've done it in an institutional structure.
[03:22:25.240 --> 03:22:27.240]   I don't know that I would do it independently.
[03:22:27.240 --> 03:22:29.360]   So the first was a graduate program in history,
[03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:30.920]   was at UC Berkeley.
[03:22:30.920 --> 03:22:34.800]   And so I had coursework and then I had structures
[03:22:34.800 --> 03:22:36.520]   and I did have people to check in with and read,
[03:22:36.520 --> 03:22:38.160]   but I had a great deal of latitude.
[03:22:38.160 --> 03:22:39.200]   I'm very grateful for it.
[03:22:39.200 --> 03:22:40.760]   People are like, you wrote a dissertation
[03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:41.840]   on Ayn Rand at Berkeley?
[03:22:41.840 --> 03:22:43.840]   I'm like, yeah, hell I did.
[03:22:43.840 --> 03:22:45.520]   Berkeley's like, it's a great place.
[03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:47.120]   And at the time I was there,
[03:22:47.120 --> 03:22:49.560]   there was absolute room for free inquiry.
[03:22:49.560 --> 03:22:51.360]   - Oh, can you just like linger on that?
[03:22:51.360 --> 03:22:53.880]   So when you said that you're doing that,
[03:22:53.880 --> 03:22:56.520]   doing a dissertation on Ayn Rand,
[03:22:56.520 --> 03:23:00.420]   was there, did people get upset?
[03:23:00.420 --> 03:23:03.440]   - No, I did have a friendly critic
[03:23:03.880 --> 03:23:06.800]   who took it upon himself to throw at me everything
[03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:09.140]   he thought the outside world would throw at me.
[03:23:09.140 --> 03:23:11.800]   I think maybe five or 10 years earlier,
[03:23:11.800 --> 03:23:13.480]   it wouldn't have been possible.
[03:23:13.480 --> 03:23:15.600]   But the most important thing I had to,
[03:23:15.600 --> 03:23:18.360]   the person I really had to convince
[03:23:18.360 --> 03:23:20.320]   this was worth doing was myself,
[03:23:20.320 --> 03:23:23.040]   because I knew it was an unconventional choice
[03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:24.800]   for the field and for a dissertation.
[03:23:24.800 --> 03:23:27.120]   But once I convinced myself,
[03:23:27.120 --> 03:23:29.160]   I just said, well, I'm gonna do this and see.
[03:23:29.160 --> 03:23:30.840]   And because it was unconventional,
[03:23:30.840 --> 03:23:32.080]   it ended up standing out.
[03:23:32.080 --> 03:23:34.660]   And when it really was the time,
[03:23:34.660 --> 03:23:39.300]   I started it during second Bush administration,
[03:23:39.300 --> 03:23:42.460]   second George W. Bush, second term.
[03:23:42.460 --> 03:23:45.140]   People were interested in just conservatism in general
[03:23:45.140 --> 03:23:47.520]   and felt no matter where they stood
[03:23:47.520 --> 03:23:49.400]   on the political spectrum felt like objectively,
[03:23:49.400 --> 03:23:51.460]   we don't know enough about this and this is a problem.
[03:23:51.460 --> 03:23:53.320]   And so they were open to learning more.
[03:23:53.320 --> 03:23:56.840]   So I really kind of caught that wave in scholarship
[03:23:56.840 --> 03:23:58.320]   and caught that wave in American culture
[03:23:58.320 --> 03:23:59.560]   where people wanted to know more.
[03:23:59.560 --> 03:24:00.760]   - I wish you'd probably say that.
[03:24:00.760 --> 03:24:04.480]   I mean, Ayn Rand is at the very least,
[03:24:04.480 --> 03:24:07.160]   as you've mentioned, a kind of gateway to conservatism.
[03:24:07.160 --> 03:24:09.240]   - Yes, I called her the gateway drug
[03:24:09.240 --> 03:24:13.440]   in that people start with Rand, they're taken by her.
[03:24:13.440 --> 03:24:17.400]   In some ways she takes the worldview of Milton Friedman
[03:24:17.400 --> 03:24:21.680]   in terms of what capitalism can accomplish economically.
[03:24:21.680 --> 03:24:24.460]   And then she puts it in this mythopoetic register
[03:24:24.460 --> 03:24:25.660]   and she fictionalizes it.
[03:24:25.660 --> 03:24:28.740]   So once people have absorbed that, they want more.
[03:24:29.760 --> 03:24:33.400]   They go on to learning more of the ideas behind that vision
[03:24:33.400 --> 03:24:36.160]   or they have become true believers, they've converted.
[03:24:36.160 --> 03:24:38.920]   And so then they head off to work for a politician,
[03:24:38.920 --> 03:24:40.560]   to work for a think tank, to work for a party.
[03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:41.520]   It's absolute traffic.
[03:24:41.520 --> 03:24:42.360]   Now, not everyone.
[03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:43.560]   There's plenty of people who read Ayn Rand
[03:24:43.560 --> 03:24:45.320]   who don't take the politics in.
[03:24:45.320 --> 03:24:47.160]   It's a nice story, it's interesting,
[03:24:47.160 --> 03:24:49.800]   just an episode in their life.
[03:24:49.800 --> 03:24:51.600]   But for others, it's really foundational.
[03:24:51.600 --> 03:24:52.760]   It really, really changes them.
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:24:55.180]   So those were the people I wanted to track very deliberately.
[03:24:55.180 --> 03:24:58.780]   I wasn't trying to do in the round everything about Ayn Rand.
[03:24:58.780 --> 03:25:01.240]   I was like, Ayn Rand and the American right,
[03:25:01.240 --> 03:25:03.400]   goddess of the market, Ayn Rand and the American right
[03:25:03.400 --> 03:25:04.240]   is the title.
[03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:06.560]   So where did they take her,
[03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:08.360]   those who took her in this political direction?
[03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:10.200]   What difference did she make?
[03:25:10.200 --> 03:25:13.920]   - If we return to like the actual, your process.
[03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:14.760]   - Yeah.
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:17.680]   - So you're showing up and you're reading sources
[03:25:17.680 --> 03:25:21.640]   and you're like, is it kind of like the process of discovery?
[03:25:21.640 --> 03:25:23.400]   You're just kind of like taking it all in
[03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:28.400]   and seeing what unifying ideas emerge
[03:25:28.600 --> 03:25:32.740]   or maybe special moments that illustrate an idea emerge.
[03:25:32.740 --> 03:25:36.780]   - Yeah, I mean, I know with the biography of a person,
[03:25:36.780 --> 03:25:39.540]   I am already given a start and an end date
[03:25:39.540 --> 03:25:41.580]   and a rough narrative of what happens.
[03:25:41.580 --> 03:25:43.900]   So I have a kind of structure.
[03:25:43.900 --> 03:25:46.860]   And then with Rand, both with Rand and Friedman,
[03:25:46.860 --> 03:25:49.100]   I started by reading their major books
[03:25:49.100 --> 03:25:50.780]   before I really read anything about them
[03:25:50.780 --> 03:25:53.900]   'cause I wanted my own experience of the material
[03:25:53.900 --> 03:25:54.780]   to be fresh.
[03:25:54.780 --> 03:25:57.620]   And I had read some Ayn Rand, but not a lot.
[03:25:57.620 --> 03:25:59.840]   Similarly, I had read some Friedman, but not a lot.
[03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:02.000]   So I had first is like, let me read the major stuff,
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:05.120]   get oriented and then just dive into the archive
[03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:06.300]   and see what's there.
[03:26:06.300 --> 03:26:08.560]   Who are they talking to?
[03:26:08.560 --> 03:26:10.360]   What's going on?
[03:26:10.360 --> 03:26:14.960]   In Rand's case, I was interested in her in the United States,
[03:26:14.960 --> 03:26:15.800]   not her in Russia.
[03:26:15.800 --> 03:26:18.400]   I didn't have the language skills to do that.
[03:26:18.400 --> 03:26:20.040]   So I start her in the United States
[03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:22.240]   and I start when she publishes her first book
[03:26:22.240 --> 03:26:23.920]   and she starts getting letters.
[03:26:23.920 --> 03:26:25.280]   And who is she writing to?
[03:26:25.280 --> 03:26:27.120]   Who's writing to her?
[03:26:27.120 --> 03:26:28.760]   And then I start to uncover this world
[03:26:28.760 --> 03:26:30.320]   of kind of nascent conservatism.
[03:26:30.320 --> 03:26:31.760]   And I'm kind of putting that together.
[03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:34.920]   And once I have enough, I say, well, that's a chapter.
[03:26:34.920 --> 03:26:36.760]   I'm gonna cover that chapter.
[03:26:36.760 --> 03:26:39.980]   And then there's gonna be, the book has come out.
[03:26:39.980 --> 03:26:41.600]   And so now I need to start a different chapter.
[03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:44.080]   What's her life like after the book has been published?
[03:26:44.080 --> 03:26:46.760]   And then I look for that, but I'm really,
[03:26:46.760 --> 03:26:48.780]   although I have this very high level structure,
[03:26:48.780 --> 03:26:52.720]   it's coming out of the archive, the material I'm finding.
[03:26:52.720 --> 03:26:54.760]   And if I'm not finding the material there,
[03:26:54.760 --> 03:26:57.160]   I won't cover it in great detail.
[03:26:57.160 --> 03:26:59.720]   Or if I've decided it's outside my ambit,
[03:26:59.720 --> 03:27:01.940]   I'm not gonna go into great depth on it.
[03:27:01.940 --> 03:27:03.820]   - And you're trying to understand the relationships.
[03:27:03.820 --> 03:27:08.100]   It's so fascinating, like reconstruct in a dark room,
[03:27:08.100 --> 03:27:11.280]   trying to reconstruct, shine a light on relationships
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:13.080]   through reading letters.
[03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:13.920]   It's interesting.
[03:27:13.920 --> 03:27:14.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:27:14.740 --> 03:27:17.080]   I mean, correspondence is really, really helpful.
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:20.880]   Drafts, correspondence, and someone this famous,
[03:27:20.880 --> 03:27:23.640]   they have oral histories, other people write about them.
[03:27:23.640 --> 03:27:25.160]   So you're reading all these different things
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:26.700]   and kind of triangulating and trying
[03:27:26.700 --> 03:27:27.840]   to sort of put them together.
[03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:30.540]   And then think about how do I present this
[03:27:30.540 --> 03:27:33.900]   in a compelling story and what do I need to explain?
[03:27:33.900 --> 03:27:36.080]   And then also for me, what was really helpful
[03:27:36.080 --> 03:27:39.360]   is that because I teach and I am explaining
[03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:41.740]   the kind of broad sweep of 20th century history.
[03:27:41.740 --> 03:27:46.440]   So I know that Rand's involved in a labor action
[03:27:46.440 --> 03:27:48.840]   at Warner Brothers, but through my teaching,
[03:27:48.840 --> 03:27:50.560]   I realized, oh yes, this is a moment
[03:27:50.560 --> 03:27:53.040]   of labor strikes across the country.
[03:27:53.040 --> 03:27:56.360]   And so then that really changes the origin story
[03:27:56.360 --> 03:28:00.200]   of Atlas Shrubbed, because she's looking at labor actions.
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:02.080]   And she originally is thinking of the book
[03:28:02.080 --> 03:28:03.900]   as being called "The Strike."
[03:28:03.900 --> 03:28:06.420]   So she's really responding in real time
[03:28:06.420 --> 03:28:08.480]   and being inspired by what's happening
[03:28:08.480 --> 03:28:12.320]   in the mid-1940s in the United States.
[03:28:12.320 --> 03:28:14.680]   So then I can kind of take that and run with that
[03:28:14.680 --> 03:28:16.120]   and figure out where to go.
[03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:18.840]   - So you're super passionate about teaching.
[03:28:18.840 --> 03:28:19.960]   You mentioned Milton Friedman,
[03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:24.960]   had a very interesting way of teaching.
[03:28:24.960 --> 03:28:27.920]   So what's your, how do you think of teaching?
[03:28:27.920 --> 03:28:30.040]   Teaching history, teaching history of ideas,
[03:28:30.040 --> 03:28:33.340]   teaching bright young minds about the past?
[03:28:33.340 --> 03:28:34.380]   - Yeah, I mean, it's great.
[03:28:34.380 --> 03:28:35.800]   It's really inspiring.
[03:28:35.800 --> 03:28:39.000]   The ways the old school kind of dominating way
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:40.880]   in which Friedman taught would not fly
[03:28:40.880 --> 03:28:44.560]   in today's university wouldn't be permitted
[03:28:44.560 --> 03:28:47.200]   and also the students wouldn't respond to it.
[03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:50.520]   So I try to share my enthusiasm.
[03:28:50.520 --> 03:28:52.760]   I think that's like almost the number one thing I bring
[03:28:52.760 --> 03:28:53.720]   is my enthusiasm.
[03:28:53.720 --> 03:28:56.560]   Like, look how neat and interesting these ideas are.
[03:28:56.560 --> 03:28:59.440]   I try to keep my own views out pretty much.
[03:28:59.440 --> 03:29:02.840]   I try to give the fairest possible rendition I can
[03:29:02.840 --> 03:29:03.680]   of each thinker.
[03:29:03.680 --> 03:29:06.040]   If I find someone really disturbing,
[03:29:06.040 --> 03:29:08.040]   I might sidebar at the end of the lecture
[03:29:08.040 --> 03:29:10.600]   and say this kind of, you know, I find this unsettling
[03:29:10.600 --> 03:29:13.300]   and this, you know, tells me something about myself.
[03:29:13.300 --> 03:29:16.080]   But most of the time I'm bringing people
[03:29:16.080 --> 03:29:18.480]   into the, like the biography of a great thinker,
[03:29:18.480 --> 03:29:19.680]   the context of them.
[03:29:19.680 --> 03:29:21.400]   And then we, in the lecture,
[03:29:21.400 --> 03:29:23.440]   we'll literally read the work together
[03:29:23.440 --> 03:29:24.440]   and we'll talk about it.
[03:29:24.440 --> 03:29:27.000]   And I'll ask the students, what are you finding here?
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:28.400]   What's jumping out at you?
[03:29:28.400 --> 03:29:32.160]   Kind of breaking down the language
[03:29:32.160 --> 03:29:34.540]   and really teaching them how to do deep reading.
[03:29:34.540 --> 03:29:37.160]   So I feel like that is my contribution right now.
[03:29:37.160 --> 03:29:39.780]   We're having trouble reading collectively.
[03:29:39.780 --> 03:29:42.040]   We're having trouble paying attention collectively
[03:29:42.040 --> 03:29:46.200]   and I'm trying to cultivate their skills to doing that
[03:29:46.200 --> 03:29:47.560]   and showing them how I do it.
[03:29:47.560 --> 03:29:49.820]   And also modeling, like this is how I would read a text.
[03:29:49.820 --> 03:29:53.040]   This is what jumps out to me when I look at, you know,
[03:29:53.040 --> 03:29:55.080]   Thomas Kuhn or something like this.
[03:29:55.080 --> 03:29:58.200]   And just show them that studying a history of ideas
[03:29:58.200 --> 03:29:59.080]   is really fun.
[03:29:59.080 --> 03:30:01.440]   I feel incredibly privileged to do it, you know?
[03:30:01.440 --> 03:30:02.760]   And the other thing is,
[03:30:02.760 --> 03:30:06.360]   I think this is the time for students in college,
[03:30:06.360 --> 03:30:07.940]   figuring out who they are,
[03:30:07.940 --> 03:30:10.200]   their minds are developing and growing.
[03:30:10.200 --> 03:30:13.160]   They can really handle complicated, hard ideas.
[03:30:13.160 --> 03:30:14.920]   They don't always have the context behind them.
[03:30:14.920 --> 03:30:16.960]   So I need to give them the hard ideas and then show them,
[03:30:16.960 --> 03:30:19.960]   this is kind of the context of what's happening in the world.
[03:30:19.960 --> 03:30:23.440]   But really, I'm just, I'm showing them the landscape.
[03:30:23.440 --> 03:30:25.720]   I don't have time to go deep.
[03:30:25.720 --> 03:30:29.400]   We have a 10 week quarter, you know, giving them a flyover.
[03:30:29.400 --> 03:30:32.080]   And then I want them to know how to go deep
[03:30:32.080 --> 03:30:33.800]   and know where they wanna go deep.
[03:30:33.800 --> 03:30:35.480]   - Do the thing that Milton Friedman did,
[03:30:35.480 --> 03:30:38.520]   which is in parallel.
[03:30:38.520 --> 03:30:40.600]   - Yes, do their own parallel curriculum.
[03:30:40.600 --> 03:30:42.160]   Exactly, exactly.
[03:30:42.160 --> 03:30:43.800]   - What advice would you give
[03:30:43.800 --> 03:30:46.360]   in terms of reading about ideas you agree with
[03:30:46.360 --> 03:30:48.520]   and reading ideas you disagree with?
[03:30:48.520 --> 03:30:50.920]   - I mean, even though I think the passion is important
[03:30:50.920 --> 03:30:52.480]   for the teaching of the ideas,
[03:30:52.480 --> 03:30:54.540]   like dispassion is more important
[03:30:54.540 --> 03:30:56.640]   for the reading and understanding of them.
[03:30:56.640 --> 03:31:00.360]   So a lot of people have said to me like,
[03:31:00.360 --> 03:31:01.720]   I could never write about Ayn Rand,
[03:31:01.720 --> 03:31:03.840]   like she makes me so angry.
[03:31:03.840 --> 03:31:05.720]   You know, and I've never become,
[03:31:05.720 --> 03:31:07.300]   I don't get angry reading her.
[03:31:07.300 --> 03:31:09.680]   Like, I'm like, oh, there you go again, you know,
[03:31:09.680 --> 03:31:11.760]   or like, well, that's gonna cause trouble, lady.
[03:31:11.760 --> 03:31:15.800]   You know, and so I guess I'm approaching it
[03:31:15.800 --> 03:31:17.680]   with a sort of charity, but also with,
[03:31:17.680 --> 03:31:19.740]   I'm not, I don't have huge expectations.
[03:31:19.740 --> 03:31:22.240]   I'm not expecting to have the light shine on me.
[03:31:22.240 --> 03:31:23.600]   I'm not expecting to agree.
[03:31:23.600 --> 03:31:26.280]   I'm like, I can be very clinical about it.
[03:31:26.280 --> 03:31:28.120]   So that's what's worked for me.
[03:31:28.120 --> 03:31:30.640]   It might not work for others,
[03:31:30.640 --> 03:31:33.800]   but, and then I just try to find the humor in it.
[03:31:33.800 --> 03:31:35.720]   You know, like how funny is it?
[03:31:35.720 --> 03:31:37.420]   Like these different aspects of them.
[03:31:37.420 --> 03:31:39.860]   You know, like when teaching my students
[03:31:39.860 --> 03:31:41.100]   about Oliver Wendell Holmes,
[03:31:41.100 --> 03:31:44.500]   like his dad wrote a poem about him.
[03:31:44.500 --> 03:31:46.280]   He called him the astronaut
[03:31:46.280 --> 03:31:47.920]   about how he came from outer space.
[03:31:47.920 --> 03:31:49.500]   He seemed like he came from outer space.
[03:31:49.500 --> 03:31:52.340]   I'm like, this is his dad's view of his son.
[03:31:52.340 --> 03:31:55.160]   Like, that's how weird of a guy he was, you know?
[03:31:55.160 --> 03:31:56.660]   And so I try to like find that,
[03:31:56.660 --> 03:31:59.180]   keep alert for those funny kind of human touches
[03:31:59.180 --> 03:32:01.740]   that like, these are ultimately just people, you know,
[03:32:01.740 --> 03:32:04.300]   people with ideas that they spent enough time polishing up
[03:32:04.300 --> 03:32:06.040]   and developing that we still want to read about them
[03:32:06.040 --> 03:32:07.700]   a hundred years later.
[03:32:07.700 --> 03:32:09.380]   - What about the dramatic formulation
[03:32:09.380 --> 03:32:10.620]   of that same question?
[03:32:10.620 --> 03:32:12.300]   Do you think there's some ideas that are good
[03:32:12.300 --> 03:32:14.060]   and some of that are evil?
[03:32:14.060 --> 03:32:15.780]   Do you think we can draw such lines
[03:32:15.780 --> 03:32:20.140]   or is it more complicated like the old Solzhenitsyn line
[03:32:20.140 --> 03:32:20.980]   between good and evil
[03:32:20.980 --> 03:32:23.340]   that runs through the heart of every person?
[03:32:23.340 --> 03:32:27.300]   - I mean, I philosophically agree with Solzhenitsyn for sure.
[03:32:27.300 --> 03:32:29.420]   I do think some ideas pull on the good side
[03:32:29.420 --> 03:32:32.540]   and some ideas pull on the bad side, like absolutely.
[03:32:32.540 --> 03:32:34.820]   And I think that's probably,
[03:32:34.820 --> 03:32:37.140]   that's probably why people dislike Rand so much
[03:32:37.140 --> 03:32:40.340]   is they feel like she's giving license to the bad side
[03:32:40.340 --> 03:32:42.820]   and she's saying it's okay to be selfish and it's okay.
[03:32:42.820 --> 03:32:45.720]   You know, they feel like she's unloosing the dark forces.
[03:32:45.720 --> 03:32:50.740]   And, you know, in some cases that may be true,
[03:32:50.740 --> 03:32:54.240]   but I also, she's also unloosing some of the light forces
[03:32:54.240 --> 03:32:57.580]   in terms of reflecting on yourself and trying to be true.
[03:32:57.580 --> 03:33:00.740]   But definitely there are ideas that are dangerous
[03:33:00.740 --> 03:33:03.220]   to play with and their ideas that I think give license
[03:33:03.220 --> 03:33:06.160]   to the darker sides of human nature.
[03:33:06.160 --> 03:33:11.340]   But I think you can see that in the historical record.
[03:33:11.340 --> 03:33:15.900]   So I think that it's possible to show that.
[03:33:15.900 --> 03:33:17.980]   And obviously there's some places, you know,
[03:33:17.980 --> 03:33:20.680]   like Germany, they think the ideas are so dangerous
[03:33:20.680 --> 03:33:22.540]   they can't be allowed to circulate.
[03:33:22.540 --> 03:33:24.940]   And in some contexts that may absolutely be true.
[03:33:24.940 --> 03:33:28.500]   - And then still, even that we should take
[03:33:28.500 --> 03:33:31.020]   with a grain of salt because perhaps censorship
[03:33:31.020 --> 03:33:33.020]   of an idea is more dangerous than the idea.
[03:33:33.020 --> 03:33:36.540]   So all of that, that's the beautiful thing about us humans.
[03:33:36.540 --> 03:33:40.420]   We are always at attention trying to figure out
[03:33:40.420 --> 03:33:42.020]   what ideas are the ones that are going
[03:33:42.020 --> 03:33:45.100]   to help humanity flourish.
[03:33:45.100 --> 03:33:50.100]   Pothead question, do humans have ideas or do ideas have us?
[03:33:50.100 --> 03:33:52.140]   So where do ideas come from?
[03:33:52.140 --> 03:33:53.660]   You have Milton Friedman sitting there
[03:33:53.660 --> 03:33:56.180]   after Rutgers trying to figure out what he can do
[03:33:56.180 --> 03:34:00.620]   about the Great Depression, what, where?
[03:34:00.620 --> 03:34:02.700]   Do you ever think about this?
[03:34:02.700 --> 03:34:04.940]   Like I sometimes think that ideas are,
[03:34:04.940 --> 03:34:06.700]   aliens are actually ideas.
[03:34:06.700 --> 03:34:10.460]   They're just kind of like travel through human brains
[03:34:10.460 --> 03:34:15.460]   and like captivate us and we get all real excited.
[03:34:15.460 --> 03:34:21.420]   Like with the monolith in 2001 Space Odyssey,
[03:34:21.420 --> 03:34:24.420]   a monolith lands and everybody gets excited
[03:34:24.420 --> 03:34:28.260]   and somehow this idea just gets everybody
[03:34:28.260 --> 03:34:31.740]   to be on the same page and it reverberates
[03:34:31.740 --> 03:34:34.460]   through the community and then that results
[03:34:34.460 --> 03:34:37.420]   in an implementation of some action that results
[03:34:37.420 --> 03:34:39.780]   in us figuring out that that idea was actually bad
[03:34:39.780 --> 03:34:41.700]   and then we learn new ideas.
[03:34:41.700 --> 03:34:44.260]   But it feels like the idea is riding the show.
[03:34:44.260 --> 03:34:46.540]   - Yeah, I mean, I think in a lot of cases,
[03:34:46.540 --> 03:34:47.780]   I think it's true.
[03:34:47.780 --> 03:34:50.020]   You know, there, Keynes has this famous quote like,
[03:34:50.020 --> 03:34:52.940]   you know, most men are slaves of some defunct economist.
[03:34:52.940 --> 03:34:56.540]   You know, and so-- - That's funny, that's funny.
[03:34:56.540 --> 03:34:59.620]   - So I do think that we, like it's really hard
[03:34:59.620 --> 03:35:01.060]   to have an original thought.
[03:35:01.060 --> 03:35:02.620]   You know, we are social creatures,
[03:35:02.620 --> 03:35:05.740]   we encounter the same situations again and again.
[03:35:05.740 --> 03:35:09.140]   And so it's really hard, you're born into these traditions
[03:35:09.140 --> 03:35:11.340]   of thinking and being and knowing
[03:35:11.340 --> 03:35:13.500]   and most people are never gonna question them
[03:35:13.500 --> 03:35:15.700]   and most people are never gonna become aware of them.
[03:35:15.700 --> 03:35:18.020]   So again, that's some of the work of what I do
[03:35:18.020 --> 03:35:21.180]   as an intellectual historian is like, let's become aware.
[03:35:21.180 --> 03:35:23.100]   Let's realize that you're carrying a map
[03:35:23.100 --> 03:35:26.500]   that's orienting you to the world in a certain way, right?
[03:35:26.500 --> 03:35:30.340]   And so I think you have to work really, really hard
[03:35:30.340 --> 03:35:31.580]   to have an original idea.
[03:35:31.580 --> 03:35:34.820]   And even then, it's not a completely original idea.
[03:35:34.820 --> 03:35:38.620]   It's a reworking and a reassembling of ideas others have had.
[03:35:38.620 --> 03:35:41.060]   So I definitely think it's possible
[03:35:41.060 --> 03:35:43.740]   to create autonomy in the realm of ideas
[03:35:43.740 --> 03:35:46.500]   and to be an autonomous consumer of ideas.
[03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:50.620]   But I think on balance, most people are not.
[03:35:50.620 --> 03:35:52.580]   And that's fine, they wanna have experiences,
[03:35:52.580 --> 03:35:55.100]   they wanna do other things with their life, you know.
[03:35:55.100 --> 03:35:56.940]   - Well, Jennifer, thank you so much
[03:35:56.940 --> 03:35:58.780]   for this journey through ideas today
[03:35:58.780 --> 03:36:01.500]   and thank you so much for your incredible work.
[03:36:01.500 --> 03:36:05.260]   It was really fun and fascinating to talk with you today.
[03:36:05.260 --> 03:36:07.180]   Thank you. - Thank you.
[03:36:07.180 --> 03:36:09.340]   - Thank you for listening to this conversation
[03:36:09.340 --> 03:36:11.340]   with Jennifer Burns.
[03:36:11.340 --> 03:36:13.620]   And now, let me try to reflect on
[03:36:13.620 --> 03:36:16.780]   and articulate some things I've been thinking about.
[03:36:16.780 --> 03:36:19.340]   If you'd like to submit questions or topics
[03:36:19.340 --> 03:36:22.180]   that I can comment on in this way here
[03:36:22.180 --> 03:36:26.260]   at the end of episodes, go to lexfriedman.com/ama
[03:36:26.260 --> 03:36:29.660]   or contact me for whatever other reason
[03:36:29.660 --> 03:36:33.100]   at lexfriedman.com/contact.
[03:36:33.100 --> 03:36:35.980]   Please allow me to say a few words about my interview
[03:36:35.980 --> 03:36:39.260]   with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.
[03:36:39.260 --> 03:36:41.700]   Now that a few days have passed
[03:36:41.700 --> 03:36:43.020]   and I've had the chance to think
[03:36:43.020 --> 03:36:45.940]   about the conversation itself, the response,
[03:36:45.940 --> 03:36:49.420]   future upcoming conversations, and what it all means
[03:36:49.420 --> 03:36:52.860]   for the war in Ukraine, for global geopolitics,
[03:36:52.860 --> 03:36:55.500]   and for us humans in general.
[03:36:55.500 --> 03:36:57.860]   I've gotten a lot of heartfelt, positive words
[03:36:57.860 --> 03:37:01.380]   from all sides, including, at least so far,
[03:37:01.380 --> 03:37:05.020]   literally everybody who knows me personally inside Ukraine,
[03:37:05.020 --> 03:37:06.900]   which includes a lot of soldiers
[03:37:06.900 --> 03:37:09.060]   and many high-profile figures,
[03:37:09.060 --> 03:37:11.460]   some who are supportive of the president
[03:37:11.460 --> 03:37:13.100]   and some who are critical of him.
[03:37:13.980 --> 03:37:16.060]   Literally all private communication
[03:37:16.060 --> 03:37:18.140]   has been positive and supportive.
[03:37:18.140 --> 03:37:20.340]   This is usually not the case with me.
[03:37:20.340 --> 03:37:22.180]   Friends usually will write to me
[03:37:22.180 --> 03:37:24.660]   to criticize and to disagree.
[03:37:24.660 --> 03:37:27.180]   That's the whole point of friendship,
[03:37:27.180 --> 03:37:30.260]   to argue and have fun doing it.
[03:37:30.260 --> 03:37:33.580]   There was none of that here, at least so far.
[03:37:33.580 --> 03:37:35.460]   So thank you for your support.
[03:37:35.460 --> 03:37:37.700]   In kind words, it means the world.
[03:37:37.700 --> 03:37:42.080]   The most common message was please keep pushing for peace.
[03:37:43.140 --> 03:37:43.980]   I will.
[03:37:43.980 --> 03:37:49.860]   But online, on the interwebs, I saw a lot of attacks,
[03:37:49.860 --> 03:37:51.980]   sometimes from swarms of online accounts,
[03:37:51.980 --> 03:37:54.180]   which, of course, makes me suspicious
[03:37:54.180 --> 03:37:55.900]   about the origin of those attacks.
[03:37:55.900 --> 03:37:58.540]   One of my friends in Ukraine,
[03:37:58.540 --> 03:38:01.260]   who, by the way, thinks the attacks are all propped up
[03:38:01.260 --> 03:38:04.740]   by Ukrainian bot farms, said there's no need
[03:38:04.740 --> 03:38:06.940]   to say anything extra.
[03:38:06.940 --> 03:38:09.540]   Let the interview stand on its own.
[03:38:09.540 --> 03:38:12.220]   Just keep focused on the mission of pushing for peace.
[03:38:13.220 --> 03:38:15.180]   Basically, he's a Ukrainian version
[03:38:15.180 --> 03:38:17.860]   of my other friend, Joe Rogan,
[03:38:17.860 --> 03:38:20.900]   who, to this day, says don't read the comments.
[03:38:20.900 --> 03:38:24.180]   This is generally good advice, and I try to follow it,
[03:38:24.180 --> 03:38:25.740]   but I'm also a human being.
[03:38:25.740 --> 03:38:27.420]   I wear my heart on my sleeve,
[03:38:27.420 --> 03:38:32.420]   and this interview, this war, for me, is deeply personal.
[03:38:32.420 --> 03:38:35.620]   And the level of vitriol, misrepresentation,
[03:38:35.620 --> 03:38:38.940]   and lies about the conversation and about me personally
[03:38:38.940 --> 03:38:42.460]   was particularly intense and disingenuous.
[03:38:42.460 --> 03:38:44.140]   So I thought I would use this opportunity
[03:38:44.140 --> 03:38:47.180]   to say a few words, just speak a bit more
[03:38:47.180 --> 03:38:49.100]   about how I approach this conversation
[03:38:49.100 --> 03:38:52.980]   with President Zelensky and conversations in general.
[03:38:52.980 --> 03:38:56.540]   This interview is something I poured my heart and soul into,
[03:38:56.540 --> 03:38:58.860]   preparing a lot.
[03:38:58.860 --> 03:39:01.660]   I've described parts of the preparation process I follow
[03:39:01.660 --> 03:39:04.220]   in the outro to the Zelensky conversation,
[03:39:04.220 --> 03:39:07.500]   but in general, let me say that I've read a lot,
[03:39:07.500 --> 03:39:10.700]   listened to a lot, and had a lot of private conversations
[03:39:10.700 --> 03:39:12.700]   with people on the ground.
[03:39:12.700 --> 03:39:15.500]   I have many flaws, but being unprepared
[03:39:15.500 --> 03:39:18.020]   for this conversation is not one of them.
[03:39:18.020 --> 03:39:22.900]   Two low-effort attacks got to me a bit, if I'm being honest,
[03:39:22.900 --> 03:39:25.900]   though I am learning to take it all in stride.
[03:39:25.900 --> 03:39:31.620]   First attack is that I'm unprepared, uninformed, or naive.
[03:39:31.620 --> 03:39:34.620]   I don't give a damn about the trolls,
[03:39:34.620 --> 03:39:37.220]   but I want people who listen to me,
[03:39:37.220 --> 03:39:39.460]   who support me, who care about my words
[03:39:39.460 --> 03:39:41.860]   to know that this is not the case.
[03:39:41.860 --> 03:39:45.060]   It never will be the case for future conversations,
[03:39:45.060 --> 03:39:48.420]   especially ones of this importance.
[03:39:48.420 --> 03:39:50.820]   I work extremely hard to prepare.
[03:39:50.820 --> 03:39:55.580]   Second low-effort attack that got to me a bit
[03:39:55.580 --> 03:39:59.580]   is that I'm a shill for Zelensky or a shill for Putin.
[03:39:59.580 --> 03:40:02.980]   Both accusations were hurled readily and freely
[03:40:02.980 --> 03:40:05.460]   by the online mob of all persuasions,
[03:40:05.460 --> 03:40:09.140]   by the left and the right in the United States and Europe,
[03:40:09.140 --> 03:40:12.300]   by the pro and the anti-Zelensky people in Ukraine
[03:40:12.300 --> 03:40:14.060]   or of Ukrainian origins,
[03:40:14.060 --> 03:40:17.740]   and by the pro and anti-Putin people in Russia
[03:40:17.740 --> 03:40:19.500]   or of Russian origins.
[03:40:19.500 --> 03:40:24.620]   As I've said over and over, this is not the case
[03:40:24.620 --> 03:40:26.700]   and will never be the case.
[03:40:26.700 --> 03:40:28.660]   I'm a shill for no one.
[03:40:28.660 --> 03:40:31.260]   More than that, I just simply refuse to be caught
[03:40:31.260 --> 03:40:33.820]   in any one single echo chamber.
[03:40:33.820 --> 03:40:35.580]   It's an ongoing battle, of course,
[03:40:35.580 --> 03:40:37.340]   because social media algorithms
[03:40:37.340 --> 03:40:40.540]   and the various dogmatic groups and tribes out there
[03:40:40.540 --> 03:40:44.900]   want to pull you in to their warm embrace of belonging
[03:40:44.900 --> 03:40:47.460]   and humans want to belong.
[03:40:47.460 --> 03:40:50.740]   But the cost of the path I have chosen
[03:40:50.740 --> 03:40:54.180]   is that I will never belong to any one group.
[03:40:54.180 --> 03:40:58.540]   In the end, like many of us must, I walk alone.
[03:40:58.540 --> 03:41:02.740]   And I try to do my best to do what is right
[03:41:02.740 --> 03:41:05.300]   to my independent heart and mind,
[03:41:05.300 --> 03:41:08.540]   not what is popular with any one group.
[03:41:08.540 --> 03:41:11.340]   My goals for this conversation were twofold.
[03:41:11.340 --> 03:41:14.700]   First, give a large platform to President Zelensky
[03:41:14.700 --> 03:41:16.940]   to explain his perspective on the war
[03:41:16.940 --> 03:41:19.460]   and to do so in a way that brings out the best
[03:41:19.460 --> 03:41:21.940]   in who he is as a leader and human being.
[03:41:21.940 --> 03:41:25.820]   Second goal was to push for peace
[03:41:25.820 --> 03:41:28.060]   and to give him every opportunity possible
[03:41:28.060 --> 03:41:30.780]   to signal that he's ready to make peace
[03:41:30.780 --> 03:41:33.780]   and to provide his vision for what that might look like.
[03:41:33.780 --> 03:41:38.620]   And just to be clear, by peace, I mean long lasting peace
[03:41:38.620 --> 03:41:41.100]   that minimizes suffering of people in the region
[03:41:41.100 --> 03:41:44.660]   and maximizes the flourishing of humanity
[03:41:44.660 --> 03:41:46.020]   in the coming decades.
[03:41:46.020 --> 03:41:51.420]   The war in Ukraine has led to over 1 million casualties
[03:41:51.420 --> 03:41:53.360]   and growing every single day.
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:41:57.260]   For some people, torn apart by loss,
[03:41:57.260 --> 03:42:00.540]   tormented and forced into a state of anger and hate,
[03:42:00.540 --> 03:42:02.960]   peace is a dirty word.
[03:42:02.960 --> 03:42:08.140]   To them, nothing less than justice must be accepted.
[03:42:08.140 --> 03:42:11.940]   I hear this pain.
[03:42:11.940 --> 03:42:14.540]   I've seen the bodies and the suffering.
[03:42:14.540 --> 03:42:20.100]   It's true, peace will not bring back your loved ones,
[03:42:20.100 --> 03:42:23.120]   but it will prevent further slaughter of more people,
[03:42:23.120 --> 03:42:26.020]   each of whom are someone else's loved ones.
[03:42:26.020 --> 03:42:30.320]   So again, the second goal of this conversation
[03:42:30.320 --> 03:42:33.060]   was to push for this kind of peace.
[03:42:33.060 --> 03:42:37.620]   So how did I approach it?
[03:42:37.620 --> 03:42:40.000]   Every conversation is its own puzzle,
[03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:42.500]   so let me try to explain my approach for this one.
[03:42:42.500 --> 03:42:46.260]   As I've said, I read and listened to a lot of material
[03:42:46.260 --> 03:42:49.540]   since February 24th, 2022.
[03:42:49.540 --> 03:42:51.580]   There would be many weeks over the past three years
[03:42:51.580 --> 03:42:55.380]   where I would spend every day, over eight hours a day,
[03:42:55.380 --> 03:42:58.660]   of focused reading and research.
[03:42:58.660 --> 03:43:00.400]   There were several rabbit holes
[03:43:00.400 --> 03:43:03.560]   that I consistently returned to and researched,
[03:43:03.560 --> 03:43:05.200]   but the most important line of inquiry
[03:43:05.200 --> 03:43:08.820]   was always peace talks, not just in this war,
[03:43:08.820 --> 03:43:11.020]   but in other wars in modern history.
[03:43:11.020 --> 03:43:15.660]   For this specific war, as part of the background prep,
[03:43:15.660 --> 03:43:18.760]   I would take notes on every single perspective I could find
[03:43:18.760 --> 03:43:22.020]   on every single major diplomatic meeting and negotiation
[03:43:22.020 --> 03:43:26.680]   that happened in Ukraine-Russia relations since 1991.
[03:43:27.760 --> 03:43:30.100]   There is a lot of material to go through,
[03:43:30.100 --> 03:43:32.700]   and there are a lot of perspectives,
[03:43:32.700 --> 03:43:36.060]   even on the very 2019 meeting
[03:43:36.060 --> 03:43:39.100]   that President Zelensky spoke about in this podcast.
[03:43:39.100 --> 03:43:41.600]   Just as a small but important example,
[03:43:41.600 --> 03:43:45.380]   Andrei Bohdan was interviewed twice by Dmitry Gordon
[03:43:45.380 --> 03:43:47.780]   and gave a deep inside look
[03:43:47.780 --> 03:43:49.860]   of the administration of President Zelensky,
[03:43:49.860 --> 03:43:52.820]   including that very 2019 meeting.
[03:43:52.820 --> 03:43:56.600]   The two interviews are 7 1/2 hours, by the way,
[03:43:56.600 --> 03:43:59.420]   and from my interviewer perspective
[03:43:59.420 --> 03:44:01.600]   are a masterclass of interviewing.
[03:44:01.600 --> 03:44:06.000]   Andrei Bohdan worked directly with President Zelensky
[03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:09.020]   as the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.
[03:44:09.020 --> 03:44:11.780]   He was there for the 2019 face-to-face meeting
[03:44:11.780 --> 03:44:14.820]   between Vladimir Zelensky and Vladimir Putin
[03:44:14.820 --> 03:44:16.380]   at the Paris Summit,
[03:44:16.380 --> 03:44:19.340]   along with French President Emmanuel Macron
[03:44:19.340 --> 03:44:22.300]   and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
[03:44:22.300 --> 03:44:25.620]   This was part of the Normandy format peace talks.
[03:44:26.400 --> 03:44:28.120]   In those two interviews,
[03:44:28.120 --> 03:44:31.320]   Andrei Bohdan gave a very different perspective
[03:44:31.320 --> 03:44:34.920]   on that 2019 meeting than did President Zelensky
[03:44:34.920 --> 03:44:36.760]   to me in our conversation.
[03:44:36.760 --> 03:44:39.640]   The perspective being that the failure
[03:44:39.640 --> 03:44:42.520]   to negotiate a ceasefire and peace
[03:44:42.520 --> 03:44:44.720]   was not a simple one-sided story.
[03:44:44.720 --> 03:44:47.760]   I don't think this is the right time for me
[03:44:47.760 --> 03:44:51.600]   to dive into that data point and be critical.
[03:44:51.600 --> 03:44:53.000]   I'm not interested in being critical
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:54.880]   for the sake of criticism.
[03:44:54.880 --> 03:44:58.840]   I am interested, once again, in productive conversations,
[03:44:58.840 --> 03:45:02.280]   critical or otherwise, that push towards peace,
[03:45:02.280 --> 03:45:04.820]   the kind I described earlier.
[03:45:04.820 --> 03:45:07.600]   This is merely an example of a data point
[03:45:07.600 --> 03:45:09.200]   I was collecting in my brain.
[03:45:09.200 --> 03:45:11.660]   There are many, many others.
[03:45:11.660 --> 03:45:15.720]   But all of it taken together made it clear to me,
[03:45:15.720 --> 03:45:17.360]   and I still believe this,
[03:45:17.360 --> 03:45:21.540]   that it is indeed very difficult but possible
[03:45:21.540 --> 03:45:25.200]   to negotiate long-lasting peace with Vladimir Putin.
[03:45:25.200 --> 03:45:29.180]   It is certainly true that Ukraine is best positioned
[03:45:29.180 --> 03:45:32.280]   to negotiate from a place of strength.
[03:45:32.280 --> 03:45:35.660]   After the invasion of February 24th, 2022,
[03:45:35.660 --> 03:45:38.080]   I believe there were three chances
[03:45:38.080 --> 03:45:40.820]   where peace was most achievable.
[03:45:40.820 --> 03:45:43.940]   First chance was March and April of 2022
[03:45:43.940 --> 03:45:45.900]   with a successful defense of the North.
[03:45:45.900 --> 03:45:50.340]   Second chance was the fall of 2022
[03:45:50.340 --> 03:45:54.700]   with a successful counter-offensive in Kherson and Kharkiv.
[03:45:54.700 --> 03:45:56.460]   The third chance is now.
[03:45:56.460 --> 03:45:59.660]   As he has stated multiple times publicly,
[03:45:59.660 --> 03:46:02.780]   Donald Trump is very interested in making peace.
[03:46:02.780 --> 03:46:06.180]   It is likely that the U.S. financial support for this war
[03:46:06.180 --> 03:46:08.040]   will continue to dwindle.
[03:46:08.040 --> 03:46:12.080]   So the leverage and the timing for peace negotiation is now.
[03:46:12.080 --> 03:46:16.100]   There is unlikely to be another chance like this
[03:46:16.100 --> 03:46:17.460]   for a long time.
[03:46:18.460 --> 03:46:22.000]   Just to zoom out on the conversation piece of this,
[03:46:22.000 --> 03:46:25.620]   I interviewed Donald Trump and may do so again.
[03:46:25.620 --> 03:46:28.740]   I interviewed Vladimir Zelensky and may do so again.
[03:46:28.740 --> 03:46:32.380]   And it seems likely that I will interview Vladimir Putin
[03:46:32.380 --> 03:46:34.580]   in Russia, in the Kremlin.
[03:46:34.580 --> 03:46:38.840]   I understand the risks and I accept them.
[03:46:38.840 --> 03:46:40.700]   The risks for me are not important.
[03:46:40.700 --> 03:46:42.180]   I'm not important.
[03:46:42.180 --> 03:46:45.180]   I merely want to do my small part in pushing for peace.
[03:46:45.180 --> 03:46:48.700]   In a moment in history, when there's a real chance
[03:46:48.700 --> 03:46:51.000]   for that peace to actually be achieved.
[03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:55.100]   I may be speaking too long, I'm sorry.
[03:46:55.100 --> 03:46:57.140]   But I can probably speak for many more hours.
[03:46:57.140 --> 03:46:59.500]   So this is in fact me trying to be brief.
[03:46:59.500 --> 03:47:03.420]   So again, my two goals were to bring out the best
[03:47:03.420 --> 03:47:06.660]   in President Zelensky as a leader and a human being,
[03:47:06.660 --> 03:47:09.020]   and to give him every opportunity possible
[03:47:09.020 --> 03:47:11.900]   to signal that he's ready to make peace
[03:47:11.900 --> 03:47:13.860]   and to lay out his vision for what
[03:47:13.860 --> 03:47:16.020]   that peace might look like.
[03:47:16.020 --> 03:47:19.900]   Like I said, step one through 10 is prepare well.
[03:47:19.900 --> 03:47:24.740]   I did, but step 11 is the actual conversation.
[03:47:24.740 --> 03:47:27.860]   There the specific psychological and personality quirks
[03:47:27.860 --> 03:47:30.060]   and qualities of the guests matter a lot.
[03:47:30.060 --> 03:47:32.140]   My job is to try to cut through the bullshit walls
[03:47:32.140 --> 03:47:35.260]   we put up as human beings and reveal directly
[03:47:35.260 --> 03:47:39.980]   or indirectly who the person truly is and how they think.
[03:47:39.980 --> 03:47:43.540]   With Zelensky, he is a deeply empathic
[03:47:43.540 --> 03:47:46.860]   and emotional human being who personally feels
[03:47:46.860 --> 03:47:49.740]   the suffering of the people of Ukraine in this war.
[03:47:49.740 --> 03:47:54.300]   This is a strength and perhaps also a weakness.
[03:47:54.300 --> 03:47:57.220]   But it is an important part of the reason why I said
[03:47:57.220 --> 03:48:00.940]   many times that he is a truly historic figure.
[03:48:00.940 --> 03:48:04.460]   Very few leaders in recent history would be able
[03:48:04.460 --> 03:48:07.560]   to pull off what he did, to stay in Kiev,
[03:48:07.560 --> 03:48:09.940]   to unite the country, to convince the West
[03:48:09.940 --> 03:48:12.820]   to join the war effort to the degree they did.
[03:48:12.820 --> 03:48:16.780]   He is also a showman, to borrow the title
[03:48:16.780 --> 03:48:19.140]   of the biography I recommended.
[03:48:19.140 --> 03:48:22.300]   A man with many layers of humor and wit,
[03:48:22.300 --> 03:48:25.580]   but also ego and temper.
[03:48:25.580 --> 03:48:29.500]   Sometimes fully self-aware and sometimes losing himself
[03:48:29.500 --> 03:48:32.380]   in the emotional rollercoaster of a painful memory
[03:48:32.380 --> 03:48:36.420]   or a turn of phrase that he can use as a springboard
[03:48:36.420 --> 03:48:38.780]   for a angry soliloquy.
[03:48:38.780 --> 03:48:42.980]   Add to this, the fact that we didn't agree to anything.
[03:48:42.980 --> 03:48:47.300]   What we will talk about or how long we will talk about it.
[03:48:47.300 --> 03:48:49.540]   The interview could have easily been five minutes
[03:48:49.540 --> 03:48:51.020]   or three hours.
[03:48:51.020 --> 03:48:54.460]   So I had to quickly gain his trust enough to open up
[03:48:54.460 --> 03:48:57.220]   and stay for a long form conversation.
[03:48:57.220 --> 03:48:59.880]   But push him enough to reveal the complexities
[03:48:59.880 --> 03:49:03.700]   of his thought process and his situation.
[03:49:03.700 --> 03:49:06.540]   This is where humor and camaraderie was essential
[03:49:06.540 --> 03:49:08.280]   and I would return to it often.
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:10.900]   Though it was very difficult given the stakes,
[03:49:10.900 --> 03:49:14.260]   the heaviness, the seriousness of the topic of the war.
[03:49:14.260 --> 03:49:17.340]   So in this case, the approach I followed
[03:49:17.340 --> 03:49:19.220]   for this conversation is constant nudges
[03:49:19.220 --> 03:49:21.180]   and questions about peace.
[03:49:21.180 --> 03:49:25.500]   Often using almost childlike statements or questions.
[03:49:25.500 --> 03:49:27.900]   I generally like these kinds of questions.
[03:49:27.900 --> 03:49:31.620]   On the surface, they may seem naive, but they're not.
[03:49:31.620 --> 03:49:34.340]   They are often profound in their simplicity.
[03:49:34.340 --> 03:49:37.420]   Like a lot of questions that children ask.
[03:49:37.420 --> 03:49:40.380]   Remember, it was a child who pointed out
[03:49:40.380 --> 03:49:42.680]   that the emperor was not wearing any clothes.
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:45.260]   I like the simplicity, the purity,
[03:49:45.260 --> 03:49:46.620]   the boldness of such questions
[03:49:46.620 --> 03:49:49.000]   to cut through the bullshit to the truth.
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:52.940]   And that truth is that hundreds of thousands of people
[03:49:52.940 --> 03:49:56.220]   died in this war and are dying every day.
[03:49:56.220 --> 03:49:59.060]   And all the other problems,
[03:49:59.060 --> 03:50:02.940]   from corruption to suspended elections to censorship
[03:50:02.940 --> 03:50:05.080]   cannot be solved until peace is made.
[03:50:05.080 --> 03:50:08.740]   I give the president every single chance
[03:50:08.740 --> 03:50:11.300]   to signal willingness to negotiate,
[03:50:11.300 --> 03:50:13.740]   knowing that both Trump and Putin
[03:50:13.740 --> 03:50:15.380]   will listen to this conversation.
[03:50:15.380 --> 03:50:18.060]   I don't think he took it
[03:50:18.060 --> 03:50:20.980]   and instead chose to speak very crude words
[03:50:20.980 --> 03:50:22.240]   towards Vladimir Putin.
[03:50:22.240 --> 03:50:25.380]   This is fully understandable,
[03:50:25.380 --> 03:50:28.100]   but not directly productive to negotiation.
[03:50:28.100 --> 03:50:31.700]   To clarify, I have hosted many conversations
[03:50:31.700 --> 03:50:34.420]   that were intensely critical of Vladimir Putin,
[03:50:34.420 --> 03:50:37.420]   from Sergei Plotkin to Stephen Kotkin.
[03:50:37.420 --> 03:50:40.100]   But this conversation is with a world leader
[03:50:40.100 --> 03:50:42.260]   speaking about another world leader
[03:50:42.260 --> 03:50:46.260]   during a historic opportunity for peace.
[03:50:46.260 --> 03:50:48.020]   Crude words of disrespect,
[03:50:48.020 --> 03:50:51.260]   while powerful, may harm negotiations.
[03:50:51.260 --> 03:50:56.100]   Peacemaking in this situation requires compromise
[03:50:56.100 --> 03:50:59.540]   in order to avoid further death and suffering.
[03:50:59.540 --> 03:51:02.300]   And I believe it requires treating the other leader
[03:51:02.300 --> 03:51:05.640]   with the seriousness you expect him to treat you with.
[03:51:05.640 --> 03:51:08.140]   This is what I was pushing for.
[03:51:08.140 --> 03:51:11.660]   All that while also putting my ego aside
[03:51:11.660 --> 03:51:13.340]   and letting the president shine,
[03:51:13.340 --> 03:51:16.820]   which is necessary to accomplish both goals one and two
[03:51:16.820 --> 03:51:18.780]   that I mentioned previously.
[03:51:18.780 --> 03:51:21.060]   This is also why I wanted the president
[03:51:21.060 --> 03:51:23.100]   to speak about Elon and Trump,
[03:51:23.100 --> 03:51:24.540]   to extend the olive branch
[03:51:24.540 --> 03:51:26.940]   for further avenues of peacemaking.
[03:51:26.940 --> 03:51:28.680]   This is not about politics.
[03:51:28.680 --> 03:51:31.820]   It is, once again, simply about peace.
[03:51:31.820 --> 03:51:35.580]   Now, all of this, my words, my attempts,
[03:51:35.580 --> 03:51:37.060]   were taken out of context
[03:51:37.060 --> 03:51:40.540]   and used to attack me by some online mobs.
[03:51:40.540 --> 03:51:44.200]   As an example, President Zelensky said in a mocking tone
[03:51:44.200 --> 03:51:45.540]   that he thinks that Vladimir Putin
[03:51:45.540 --> 03:51:50.140]   is simply irritated by people who are alive in Ukraine.
[03:51:50.140 --> 03:51:54.180]   And I answered, quote, "If you believe this,
[03:51:54.180 --> 03:51:56.620]   "it will be very difficult to negotiate.
[03:51:56.620 --> 03:51:58.180]   "If you think that the president of a country
[03:51:58.180 --> 03:51:59.660]   "is completely crazy,
[03:51:59.660 --> 03:52:03.780]   "it is really hard to come to an agreement with him.
[03:52:03.780 --> 03:52:06.580]   "You have to look at him as a serious person
[03:52:06.580 --> 03:52:08.060]   "who loves his country
[03:52:08.060 --> 03:52:10.580]   "and loves the people in this country.
[03:52:10.580 --> 03:52:14.300]   "And he conducts, yes, destructive military actions."
[03:52:14.300 --> 03:52:18.460]   The president interrupted me at this point and said,
[03:52:18.460 --> 03:52:20.580]   "Who are you talking about now?
[03:52:20.580 --> 03:52:22.660]   "Who loves this country?"
[03:52:22.660 --> 03:52:25.100]   And I said, "Putin.
[03:52:25.100 --> 03:52:27.560]   "Do you think he doesn't love his country?"
[03:52:27.560 --> 03:52:29.760]   And the president answered, "No."
[03:52:29.760 --> 03:52:33.660]   Again, this is not a podcast conversation
[03:52:33.660 --> 03:52:35.540]   with a historian or activist.
[03:52:35.540 --> 03:52:38.140]   And I somehow, out of nowhere, just for fun,
[03:52:38.140 --> 03:52:41.340]   waxed poetic about Putin's or Zelensky's
[03:52:41.340 --> 03:52:43.440]   or Trump's love of nation.
[03:52:43.440 --> 03:52:47.380]   It is a conversation with a world leader
[03:52:47.380 --> 03:52:51.220]   discussing the opportunity to negotiate peace
[03:52:51.220 --> 03:52:54.280]   when a large number of people are dying every single day.
[03:52:54.280 --> 03:52:58.780]   Even if the hardball is over with hate,
[03:52:58.780 --> 03:53:00.980]   leadership now requires sitting
[03:53:00.980 --> 03:53:03.780]   at the negotiation table and compromising.
[03:53:03.780 --> 03:53:06.440]   This may be painful, but it is necessary.
[03:53:06.440 --> 03:53:09.340]   There are a few other places in the conversation
[03:53:09.340 --> 03:53:12.380]   where some online mobs took my words out of context
[03:53:12.380 --> 03:53:14.700]   and used them to call me naive
[03:53:14.700 --> 03:53:16.780]   and to call for more war,
[03:53:16.780 --> 03:53:19.180]   saying peace is impossible with a man
[03:53:19.180 --> 03:53:21.520]   who they claim is the second coming of Hitler.
[03:53:21.520 --> 03:53:27.500]   My friends, if you make such attacks on this conversation,
[03:53:27.500 --> 03:53:30.420]   it is in fact you who are naive
[03:53:30.420 --> 03:53:33.840]   and ignorant of the facts of history and geopolitics.
[03:53:33.840 --> 03:53:37.940]   Peace must be made now,
[03:53:37.940 --> 03:53:41.100]   in order for death and suffering to stop,
[03:53:41.100 --> 03:53:44.020]   in order for Ukraine to have a chance to flourish,
[03:53:44.020 --> 03:53:48.060]   and in order for the drums of a global war to stop beating.
[03:53:49.140 --> 03:53:51.780]   A global war that would cripple humanity.
[03:53:51.780 --> 03:53:57.600]   This was my goal, once again, to push for peace,
[03:53:57.600 --> 03:54:01.760]   and I will continue this effort to the best of my ability.
[03:54:01.760 --> 03:54:04.020]   Thank you.
[03:54:04.020 --> 03:54:04.860]   I love you all.
[03:54:04.860 --> 03:54:08.020]   (audience applauding)
[03:54:08.020 --> 03:54:10.600]   (upbeat music)
[03:54:10.600 --> 03:54:12.660]   you
