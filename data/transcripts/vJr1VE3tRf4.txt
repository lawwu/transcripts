[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Well, we start the new week
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.200]   looking at the distracted heart.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.100]   What do we do when our hearts are too distracted
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.720]   to focus on Christ?
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.760]   Two listeners ask about it.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.320]   Pastor John, first is Tess.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.600]   Tess writes, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.000]   "Thank you for such an amazing and unique platform
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.120]   "to minister to people's hearts through this podcast."
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.120]   When it comes to setting my mind on the things of Christ,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.860]   like it says in Colossians 3, 2,
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.640]   I know how to preach truth to myself
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.920]   and remind myself of God's promises in scripture.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.280]   However, when I think about my ex-boyfriend
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.020]   dating one of my dear friends
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.440]   that have both walked away from the Lord recently,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.120]   my mind is so fixed on that one thing,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.200]   I can't focus on the Word.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.520]   How can I train my distracted mind away from this world
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.580]   and its worries and stresses,
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.600]   and instead set my full gaze on Christ himself?
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.100]   I'd love some insight on this.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.800]   And then Michelle from Canada writes in,
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.280]   "Pastor John, you have no idea how helpful this podcast
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.120]   "has been for me.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.620]   "Thank you for responding to every question
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.620]   "with thoughtfulness and love.
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.540]   "Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep,
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.980]   "and what's helped me the most is daydreaming
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.880]   "about the things that will probably never happen to me.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.160]   "I imagine my dream home with lavish furniture,
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.700]   "traveling to remote places,
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.360]   "being the CEO of a company, and so on.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.660]   "Although it helps me fall asleep,
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.840]   "I'm left feeling guilty to thinking about the Lord
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.880]   "and what he's doing in my real life
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.240]   "doesn't bring me the same peace.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.140]   "I'm now finding that these imaginary scenarios
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.820]   "consume me during my day-to-day routine outside of sleep,
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.960]   "during my commute to work,
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.860]   "getting ready in the morning, cooking, and more.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.920]   "Given that the Bible tells us to set our minds
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.680]   "on things that are above and not on things
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.240]   "that are on earth," in Colossians 3:2,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.440]   "is it a sin to daydream in these ways?"
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.960]   - When I first heard these two questions,
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.520]   they both raise a question about Colossians 3,2,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.320]   namely, set your minds on things that are above,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.640]   not on things that are on the earth,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.640]   but also because they point to almost opposite ways
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.520]   of struggling with this verse.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.520]   Tess is struggling with the controlling thought
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.960]   about something she has lost, a boyfriend and more,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.360]   and Michelle is struggling not with something she has lost,
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.800]   but something she dreams of having,
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.180]   a dream home, traveling, being a CEO.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.040]   The very fact that setting our minds
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.600]   on things that are above can be hindered
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   by both regrets and by dreams
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.560]   is very instructive for us.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.600]   It's instructive because it reminds us
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.920]   that the heart of our problem
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.120]   is not what we had and lost
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.080]   or what we never had but desire to have.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.120]   The problem is deeper.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.880]   It's similar to the instruction we get
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.840]   when we realize that being wealthy and being poor
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.720]   might both be characterized by being greedy and covetous.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   The person who has a lot may trust and love his possessions,
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.840]   and the person who has little may crave earthly things
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.080]   with as much passion as a rich person loves them.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.840]   So the essence of the problem is not in the wealth
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.260]   or the poverty.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.320]   The essence of the problem is in the heart
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.500]   and what it desires and where it rests.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.500]   That's what I would say we learn from Tess and Michelle.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.440]   The essence of the problem is not that something
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.480]   has been lost or something has not yet been gained.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.800]   The essence of the problem is deeper.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   In both cases, setting the mind on things that are above
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.880]   is hindered by a recurring pattern of thought.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.440]   In one case, a pattern of thought
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.920]   about what she had lost,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.800]   and in the other case, a pattern of thought
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.680]   about what she doesn't yet have and dreams of having.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.280]   And I think if we read Colossians 3, 1 to 4,
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.740]   the Lord will show us what may be the common,
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.880]   deeper root of the problem here.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.880]   So let's read it.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.920]   If you have been raised with Christ,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.320]   seek the things that are above.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.720]   Where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.000]   Set your mind on things that are above,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.340]   not on things that are on the earth.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.640]   For you have died and your life is hidden
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.240]   with Christ in God.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.900]   When Christ who is your life appears,
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.860]   then you will appear with him in glory.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.640]   Now, these words are simply breathtaking.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.800]   They are breathtaking in what they show us
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.520]   about the reality of who Tess and Michelle are,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.480]   who they are and who Jesus Christ is.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.840]   So five things that Tess and Michelle
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.520]   need to know about themselves.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.840]   One, they have died.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.720]   Verse three, because of their union with Christ by faith,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.840]   their old, unbelieving, rebellious, perishing self
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.240]   died when Christ died.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.240]   Two, they have been raised with Christ from the dead.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.920]   Verse one, they are a new creation in Christ.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.480]   This is not something to be achieved,
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.040]   but something that has happened to them.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.800]   God has done this.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.400]   Three, the essence of their new life in Christ
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.320]   is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.960]   Verse three, they are as real and as secure
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.440]   as Christ is in heaven.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.440]   Four, their life is not only hidden with Christ in God,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.040]   but Christ himself is their life.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.040]   Verse four, their life is as destructible as Christ,
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.720]   because he is their life.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.920]   Five, at the coming of Christ in glory,
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.480]   Tess and Michelle will appear with him
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   as the everlasting, glorious beings that they really are,
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.680]   even though very few people can see that in them now.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.160]   Those are five staggering realities
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.840]   that Tess and Michelle need to know about themselves.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.280]   And here are the four realities about Christ
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.040]   in those verses.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.840]   One, Christ is alive, alive forevermore.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.680]   Verse one.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.680]   Two, Christ is right now seated at the right hand of God.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.200]   Verse one, he is a co-ruler of all things in the universe.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.140]   Three, Christ is now the life of his people.
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.960]   Verse three, all our new everlasting existence
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.960]   flows from him and consists in our union with him.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.120]   Four, Christ is going to appear on the clouds
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.280]   with great glory to establish his kingdom.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.520]   That's verse four.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.240]   And with him, all his people will shine like the sun
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.480]   with his kingly glory.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.980]   Now, embedded in those nine,
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.900]   set your mind on things that are above,
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.000]   not on things that are on the earth.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.520]   That's embedded in those glories.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.920]   And what I'm suggesting is that the deeper issue
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.960]   that Tess and Michelle are dealing with
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.920]   and all of us deal with
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.420]   is that they may be trying to obey this exhortation
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.520]   to set their minds on things that are above
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.520]   without getting a clear, deep, satisfying grasp
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.880]   of these nine glorious realities
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.120]   about themselves and about Christ.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.120]   In other words, it's hard to set your mind on something
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.640]   over against your losses and your dreams
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.920]   if that something that you're trying to set your mind on
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.920]   is not clear and great and beautiful and desirable
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.240]   in your mind and your heart.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.600]   Now, I realize someone is gonna say to me,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.280]   but how does that help them since they're saying
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.960]   that thoughts about loss and thoughts about dreams
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.800]   are precisely what is keeping them
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.920]   from setting their minds on the greatness and the beauty
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.320]   and the desirableness of these realities.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.960]   So you haven't said anything helpful, Piper.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.880]   (Piper and David laughing)
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.040]   Now, to which my response is this,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.320]   it's not quite like that.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.720]   Let me explain.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.760]   When I lie awake at night,
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.880]   knowing that I need sleep and it's not coming
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.200]   and I'm tempted to set my mind on something earthly
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.160]   that I want or that I regret,
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:53.480]   what helps me turn my mind toward things that are above
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.960]   is that I have devoted significant time and energy
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   on a few passages of scripture to penetrate through
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.720]   to the clarity of the greatness and the beauty
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.280]   and the desirableness of the reality that is there.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.200]   In other words, I don't expect all of that work
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.000]   to happen on my pillow.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.200]   The times when I need to direct my thoughts
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   away from anxieties and earthly cravings
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.280]   is not the time for doing the serious business
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.760]   of understanding texts and penetrating through them
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.080]   to great and beautiful reality
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.080]   that can conquer my wandering thoughts.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.080]   So my suggestion for Tess and Michelle and all of us
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   is that we devote certain times to create a reservoir
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:05.440]   of beauty and glory and greatness and desirableness
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.640]   with a few passages of scripture
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.360]   so that when in the course of the day or night,
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.440]   we try to set our minds on things that are above,
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.440]   we don't have to fill that reservoir at that moment.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.480]   It's already there.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.480]   We can ask God, "Father, as I recite this verse
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.760]   or as I recite this passage now,
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.760]   cause me to see, to really see and savor
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.240]   and stand in awe of the greatness and the beauty
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.360]   and the desirableness of things that are above."
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.440]   - Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.400]   And thank you for the questions today, Tess and Michelle.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.920]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.280]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.560]   search our growing archive or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.520]   all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.760]   Well, speaking of desires for the world,
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.800]   we are far too easily pleased.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.880]   That's the main problem we have here in America.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.040]   We are not too hedonistic, too pleasure-centered.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.880]   No, we're not pleasure-centered enough.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.680]   We settle for the world's paltry pleasures
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.000]   at the expense of giving our lives to pursue our deepest
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.160]   and most lasting joy,
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.920]   seeking what will make us happy forever.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.160]   And in settling for the trivial pleasures of this world,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.600]   we undermine both of our chief callings in life.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.720]   How so?
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.680]   That's what we're gonna talk about next time.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   A lot on the table.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   Then I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.300]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.360]   Thanks for listening.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:56.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
