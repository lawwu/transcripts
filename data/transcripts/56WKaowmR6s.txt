[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   In 2020, Ligonier sponsored that study that was conducted by LifeWay, it was the state
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.520]   of the American theology study, and it assessed how Americans view God.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.860]   The following was reported on all four surveys, two-thirds of Americans have considered the
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.720]   resurrection an actual occurrence, that's good, but the majority of Americans deny the
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.920]   deity of Christ.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.920]   That gets weird.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880]   They say, "You believe in the resurrection, but He wasn't God," and it only gets kind
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880]   of weirder from there.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.600]   Listen to this, almost six in ten categorize the Holy Spirit as being a force rather than
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:47.400]   a personal being, and then the majority of Americans denied that Jesus has always existed,
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.200]   so now we have created being.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:58.220]   A consistent seven in ten Americans believe in one true God in three persons, that's good,
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.480]   and almost two-thirds believe God is perfect, that's good too, it's better than nothing.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.600]   Almost as many believe God accepts worship from all religions, that's not good.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.600]   And then listen to these, 65% of Americans agree God is a perfect being and cannot make
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.960]   a mistake.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.360]   52% of Americans agree Jesus was a great teacher, but He was not God, 55 agree that Jesus is
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.480]   the first and greatest being created by God, probably a lot of Mormons in that group, two-thirds
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.640]   of adult Americans agree biblical accounts of the physical bodily resurrection of Jesus
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.280]   are completely accurate, this event actually occurred, and then 59% of Americans agree
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.560]   the Holy Spirit is a force but not a personal being, 19% of Americans agree the Holy Spirit
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.160]   can tell me what to do with something completely forbidden in the Bible.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.280]   Okay, 72% of Americans agree there's one true God in three persons, God the Father, God
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.760]   the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, and 64% of Americans agree God accepts the worship
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.720]   of all religions including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.680]   These surveys, I always get a kick out of them, and the only reason I'd use this one
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.880]   is Ligonier's name is on it, so we know that the train is on the tracks.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.140]   The amount of contradictions, you catching it?
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.200]   It's a microcosm of how a lot of us see the issues around us and the world around us filled
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.280]   with contradictions.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.200]   People who come to our churches and say they believe one thing, but then they say they
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.480]   believe another, those two things are illogically at odds with each other.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.160]   We see the world around us.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.280]   Mike Riccardi did a phenomenal job dismantling all of that.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.480]   I hope with sermons like that I sit there sometimes and I pray, "Lord, would you let
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.240]   this one just sort of leak out that even an unbeliever who's conservative would go, 'Look,
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.400]   you may not believe in Jesus, but listen to this guy.'"
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.680]   And Mike's just blasting every worldly ideology with the truth.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.420]   People are confused.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.320]   We serve a lot of confused people.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.080]   In America, in Canada, and take it further, those of you who are international, the stats
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.640]   would be even worse than this.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.040]   You guys don't even get surveys, I think, in some of the places you are, because no
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.940]   one cares.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.560]   It's tough.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.680]   George Barna concluded in one recent study that only a small minority, they found six
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.760]   percent of professing Christians actually possess a biblical worldview, six percent
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.400]   of professing Christians.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.480]   And so, brothers, we need to be teaching our people theology.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.040]   They're not too simple-minded for it.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.200]   They're actually hungry for it.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.060]   A lot of people keep coming to church because they want the Word.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.000]   I think more and more this has been fun to watch people exit shallow pools of easy-believism
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.160]   and sort of the social club version of Christianity to come to a church where a guy gets up with
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.840]   the Word of God and says, "Turn in your copy of God's Word," like H.B., or, "Turn in your
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   Bibles."
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.800]   I was talking to a family recently that came to our church, and they had asked their son
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.760]   what he enjoyed the most about his morning there.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.200]   And he said, unprompted, "It was really awesome.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.840]   I actually felt for the first time that I wasn't in kid care," he called it.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.680]   He comes from a mega church that has about 5,000 to 7,000 in weekend attendance.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   Mega is not bad.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.160]   I know where I'm standing right now.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.240]   Big isn't bad, but the way that we try to draw people often in those movements, you
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.040]   already know, is let's have fun.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.120]   There was a Sunday where he was told, "You don't need to bring your Bible.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.120]   Just leave it over there.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120]   We have a lot to do today.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.120]   We have a lot of activities.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120]   You won't need that."
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.720]   A child should never hear that at church.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.880]   We talked to parents at our church, I'm sure you do too, crying over the 15 or 20 years
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.880]   they wasted.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.880]   They feel so guilty.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.040]   They think, "What have I been doing?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.120]   Our kids had fun.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   That's why we chose it.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   I didn't know this stuff.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.640]   The woman I talked to and her husband at membership class, bless their hearts, so sweet, dear friends,
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.120]   now that first membership class, I remember them, she's clutching her new MacArthur study
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.400]   Bible like it was a life raft in the middle of a storm in the ocean.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.600]   And they said, "We just, we didn't think of this.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.080]   We didn't know."
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.600]   That's what they want from you and I now.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.800]   They always have, the remnant at least.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.680]   But more and more, I think people are waking up and the Lord is gathering His church.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.620]   I think some pastors may be insecure if this is you.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.620]   Don't get sucked into it.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.560]   "Well, they'll be bored with theology if I preach this stuff."
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.420]   I would argue that people only get bored if we're boring or they're unbelievers.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.860]   But believers don't get bored unless you're the one putting them to sleep.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.200]   I remember a seminary professor once telling me, "You're not supposed to sound like a running
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.800]   commentary."
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.280]   Another man who was a seminary professor said, "Too many of you guys preach like your seminary
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.400]   professors are listening."
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   I was convicting, "Just in case they watch on YouTube, I really want to sound smart."
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.080]   Like, who cares?
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.120]   Preach for, you know, Jay, the plumber who's going to work the next morning, dealing with
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:33.720]   issues, preach to Mark, who shook his fist and added another appendage when he was driving
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.240]   and didn't like what the guy next to him did.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   Pray for him.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.240]   Preach to him.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   Help him.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.400]   Don't preach to your seminary professors.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.600]   They poured into you, so you'd go preach the Word to people.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.380]   You don't need to sound smart.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.380]   Give them doctrine.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.960]   But if we're joyful and we're vibrant and we love the Lord and we are practical as well
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.240]   or experiential, as Joel Beeky always talks about, you know, taking it all the way.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.880]   We don't need to apply things as much as the Puritans did.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.680]   You know, the Puritans in their preaching, they'd spend all that time just in every facet
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.280]   of those of you who are lawyers and those of you who are...
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.600]   We don't need to make long lists, but make it practical, bring it into daily life.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.960]   This is good for us and it will help them in the midst of their challenge of knowing
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.800]   what to believe.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.520]   Their discernment will increase as their armory of truth does, so give them that.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.120]   Many times over, Christians suffer from what Spurgeon described with discernment is the
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.640]   difference between knowing what is right and then almost right.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.760]   I think people hear a lot of that.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.800]   They need our help.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.240]   And so I want to walk you through three particular ways that you can recognize and rejoice in
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.280]   the Spirit's work with your people who are God's people, and then you can add to these
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.560]   and their sub-lists as well.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:02.160]   And before I get to number one and unpack it, I want to talk about two extremes.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.120]   Extreme number one.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:12.560]   We've got charismatic abuses and we've got a lot of sensational emotionalism, and that
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.120]   confuses a lot of people.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.360]   That's a bad thing today.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.160]   It's a lot of bad theology.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160]   That's an extreme.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.280]   We want to be aware of it and we want to watch out for it.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.240]   Not long ago, I was watching the video again, the old video of Jen Johnson, you know the
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.560]   Bethel singer, and she's up there and she does this multiple times in conferences, and
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.880]   the one I saw, she has no shoes on, which is like a thing in that world.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.680]   I've got a family member who every time I see her on video leading worship, she's barefoot
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.240]   and sort of just running around all over the place.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240]   It's a thing.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.160]   It's kind of like the "take off your shoes, this is holy ground" idea.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.680]   And so Jen Johnson's in the chair and she says, "The Holy Spirit to me is like the genie
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.680]   from Aladdin."
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.040]   How many of you guys have not seen that video or heard that before?
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.280]   Wow.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.600]   Okay, brothers, that's a useful illustration then.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.760]   I thought I was going to just get, "Oh yeah, we've seen it, Costi."
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.240]   Yeah, that would be a great place to start.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:20.920]   I don't have time to get into Bethel and all their issues, but that's a real like popular
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.320]   kind of foundational teaching.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.800]   They make a mystical funny.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.600]   She says, "He's funny, he's sneaky, and he's silly."
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.920]   And then she says, "He's wonderful.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   He's like the wind.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.920]   He's all around."
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.960]   And then in another video she goes, "And he's blue," after talking about...and she holds
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.440]   up her barefoot with her blue jeans and waves her foot up and down in the air, and everyone
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.360]   laughs and thinks it's great.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:51.840]   And then she's, you know, at these major conferences, and she's all over the place with the lineups
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.400]   of other women speakers, and you're Christine Caines, and you're Jackie Hill Perrys now,
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.680]   and it's just that whole swath of individuals.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:06.200]   And I'm not saying that, you know, they all think as weird as she does, but that would
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.440]   give you an idea of sort of just what Big Eva, and I'm not using it in the conspiracy
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.760]   theory way, it's just that the way that kind of Big Eva, giant kind of conference world
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   does it.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:24.760]   They bring together all these people with their disillusioned and confused and divergent
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:31.000]   theology, a wide spectrum, and say, "Hey, we're all just, you know, big tent, big family
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   of God.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Let's just worship Jesus."
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.120]   And your kids go to Passion, and they feel the feels, and they've got the wristbands
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.800]   that light up like the Coldplay at concerts to the music, and they're all experiencing
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   God.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:49.480]   I mean, these are the people who are teaching and modeling theology for a massive generation
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.120]   who, by the way, is really eager for the power of God.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.640]   Why do you think the Asbury stuff started, and why do you think it went viral?
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.120]   It's because young people, they're not just floating around.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.480]   They actually want the power of God.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.200]   They want to experience God.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.600]   They want truth.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.600]   They want to be a part.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.880]   The largest demographic of volunteers in our church plant, and believe me, we're multigenerational
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880]   already.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.040]   We have a lot of gray-haireds, you know, the crown of wisdom that serve.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:26.660]   We have elders that range from age 67 to 50s, and I'm 39, I mean, we have a wide amount
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.660]   of people.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:34.060]   The largest demographic of volunteers in our church are college students.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.580]   They show up in droves.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.220]   We don't even have to ask them.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.260]   They set the church up.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.660]   They tear it down.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.400]   They go to snobby coffee places together.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.640]   They eat burritos together.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.700]   They have their own shirts, their own hoodies.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.700]   Some guy's making something.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.340]   Next thing, I go, "I want one of those."
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.280]   They're like, "We'll make you one," you know.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.520]   They have their own little, like, Christian in the church kind of cult thing going, and
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.520]   I'm okay with it.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.160]   I love it because they want to be mobilized.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.800]   They're going in groups to Radius.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.000]   Some of them want to be missionaries.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.520]   They're going to Fiji with pre-men choy in May.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.720]   They just want to keep going.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.800]   They're crazy.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:18.160]   And I think of them, and I say, "Wow, imagine if none of you had sound doctrine.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.280]   You'd be in all these YouTube videos chasing the stuff that's hitting the mainstream."
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.880]   They're a zealous generation, so what they need from you and I is truth to be paired
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.960]   with their zeal.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.000]   Give them the doctrine.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Give them the truth.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.400]   They want answers.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.960]   When studies are showing that six out of ten have an inaccurate worldview, and they think
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:49.200]   the Holy Spirit's a force, brothers, you are the solution from God to His people.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.200]   You're not the mediator.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   That's Christ.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.880]   You're just the messenger.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:13:00.320]   But if you do your job well, and I do, that extreme of charismatic chaos and that insanity,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.080]   the noise quiets a little more in your parts.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.160]   It'll never go away until Christ returns.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   Certainly, we know that.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.840]   It'll only get worse as more of the world gets sucked in, but the church will grow stronger
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.000]   in the midst of that darkness, amen?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:26.640]   Extreme number two, this is some of us, neglecting His work, ignoring His work, or even with
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.840]   the best of intentions, because we don't want to be weird, treating Him as a bit of a "less
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   than" in the Trinity.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.480]   Now, you don't believe that, and neither do I theologically.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.760]   Doctrinally, you and I would be orthodox.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:48.080]   But the way that we treat His work is sometimes, in some places, and if this is you, let the
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:54.240]   Holy Spirit convict you, metaphorically we relegate Him.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:01.640]   And in a room like this one, metaphorically, so relax, you can't relegate God, but we would…
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.560]   I didn't do this on purpose, but it's a perfect illustration.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   We would put Him behind that curtain over there, and we would metaphorically hope the
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:16.620]   Holy Spirit sort of is there, it's sort of awkward, no one knows what to pray.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:22.000]   Some guys, we thank you for your spirit, and that's all.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.900]   They don't want to say too much more.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.360]   Some people, they get weird if you sing a hymn, and even weirder if you sing a hymn
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.200]   to the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.960]   We shouldn't be talking to Him.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.960]   We don't know what to do at times, and I don't mean to make fun, I'm with you in this.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.380]   That's why part of the reason I wrote the book is I sometimes don't know what I fully
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.840]   think or fully believe about something until I just spend a lot of time like you, studying
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:52.080]   it, then writing it on paper and looking and saying, "Is that biblical?"
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.080]   That's what we need to do.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.360]   So in church, at times, through our leadership, maybe we don't know what to say, we don't
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.800]   say things as fully as we ought to, or we ignore them in the song selection, which by
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.400]   the way, thanks to Piper, this quote, "The congregation doesn't learn its theology from
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.080]   only the sermons that it preaches or they preach, but the songs that they sing."
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.480]   So we want to sing about the Spirit's work, His true work.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.040]   At the same time, in our prayers, we don't acknowledge Him, we're just happy that nobody
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.040]   did anything weird.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.320]   Then somebody raises their hands and we're like, "Oh, they must have been influenced
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:32.880]   by the charismatic movement for sure."
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.620]   We forget at times the way that the Bible describes a people who are excited about their
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.180]   God.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:44.560]   The Old Testament is not useless in this regard.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.720]   I sometimes tell our church how exciting it would be, I'm like hinting.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.840]   One day if they would, when I read the Word of God, raise their hands, like when the book
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.040]   of the law was read aloud, you think about Ezra and Nehemiah and that whole era, what
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:04.520]   if people got excited in the Reformed-ish Bible church camp, if you will, because they
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.840]   believed this stuff.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.200]   And I'm not saying that everybody has to be a hyper-emotional expressor, some of you men
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.640]   are going, "What are you suggesting, Costi?"
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.440]   I'm suggesting that if it's your personality, brother, to stand and meditate on the lyrics
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.280]   MacArthur-style, praise God for you, sing with all your heart.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.920]   But if it's the style of some in your church to be excited and they do a little bit of
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:38.320]   this in the middle of something, you don't need to go.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.760]   Bob Kauflin means the stuff he's doing up there, you could tell.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.680]   You could tell because it doesn't fit all the time, he's just in his little world worshiping
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.420]   Jesus, and he's yelling, "It's true!
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.760]   It's true!
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.760]   This is true!"
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.120]   And it just sort of almost makes it okay.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.680]   You start thinking, "Yeah, people are just excited about Jesus.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:06.140]   Not everyone is a charismatic crazy here to derail the whole service, they're just excited
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.140]   about Jesus."
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:15.840]   I've got a brother that likes to say amen during sermons a lot.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.940]   I'm not going to tell him to stop.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.000]   He's saying, "Let it be."
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.220]   I'm saying, "I hope so."
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.220]   That's my prayer.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:29.020]   That's the elder's prayer.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.200]   So let's be careful of the extremes.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   Amen?
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.480]   All right, three things.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.120]   Number one, the deity of the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.640]   I'm going to go through these things quickly so we can get to Q&A with about solid 20 minutes
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.640]   and 15 to go.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.080]   The deity of the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:51.240]   Your church needs to understand that He's God, and you need to teach about His deity
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:18:00.160]   and His equality in the Trinity, that He's an active and equal person in the Trinity.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.040]   In Christianity we understand our God is one, yet He exists in three persons, and that will
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.440]   seem a little bit confusing to their minds, and you come alongside that with understanding
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.680]   and say, "Yeah, me too.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.680]   He's an incomprehensible God."
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.600]   And you can quote R. C. Sproul who said, "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a contradiction
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.840]   but a mystery, for we cannot fully understand how God can exist in three persons."
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:31.580]   You don't ditch doctrine because it's beyond your comprehension.
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.560]   You just submit to it.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.680]   You embrace that tension.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:42.020]   And what a comfort to know that God, while He's knowable, He's made Himself knowable
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:49.080]   to a degree, is altogether unknowable in all that He is.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.760]   Teach your people that He's God.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.480]   The Holy Spirit is God in the Old Testament.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:00.520]   Let me just give you 10 observation or examples.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.160]   If you want to screenshot these, they'll be on the screen.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.880]   Hovering over the waters before creation, Genesis 1-2.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:12.460]   Killing certain men under Moses, Exodus 35, empowering Joshua, coming upon Gideon, Samson,
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.420]   rushing upon David when he was anointed as king, departing from Saul, carrying along
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.260]   the word of the prophets.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.060]   I love this though from 2 Peter.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.440]   So in the New Testament, Peter saying the Holy Spirit was in the Old Testament, carrying
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.100]   along the word of the prophets.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.320]   Isn't that good?
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:36.120]   What a comfort to know He was always there, ensuring that the Word made it to its destination.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.960]   You could apply that in your own prayer life, asking God to take the Word that you preach
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.460]   to its destination, ask Him to penetrate their hearts, to open up their minds.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.460]   What a neat thing.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:51.520]   We're not prophets anymore in the sense that we're foretelling the future, but we have
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:20:00.380]   the preaching voice, the prophetic voice of forth telling the Word of God to His people.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:06.400]   Calling Ezekiel and then prophesied to one day rest upon the Messiah.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.420]   We're in the book of Matthew at our church right now going verse by verse.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:19.880]   It's been so fun to see the Holy Spirit's present activity, His work with Christ, baptism
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:28.680]   through temptation, onward, powerful stuff, all the way back to His conception.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.920]   The Holy Spirit in the New Testament, He moves in a normative way, if you will, because the
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:41.600]   language we see suddenly shift a bit from coming upon believers, mostly, in the Old
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.600]   Testament.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.840]   I unpack this a little bit in the book.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:52.740]   There are some instances where the description is "in" or "filling," but generally moving
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.760]   to entering into believers under the new covenant through Christ.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   Why?
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.800]   Because He's God.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.520]   And now He's made us, the church, the believer, His temple.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.160]   And so that's made clear.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:11.040]   He's mentioned almost a hundred times in Matthew, Mark, and Luke alone.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.760]   He conceives Jesus in Mary's womb, present at baptism, sent by the Father.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.720]   He teaches the disciples all things and reminds them of what Jesus was taught.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.320]   You know it's good to teach your people when they have these questions about bibliology
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.160]   is how did they know?
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.560]   You know, "So-and-so says," or the YouTube video I watched, you know, the guy is saying
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.040]   that how do you know?
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.240]   That's why we have all these conflicting accounts.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:42.320]   You could take them to a clear understanding of how the Holy Spirit called to memory for
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.320]   the disciples.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.080]   And then you can take them to John 16 and just preach on the Holy Spirit's job description
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.960]   through the original apostles and the authors.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   Powerful stuff.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.400]   He's God.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.960]   Believers are baptized in His name, Matthew 28, 19 and 20.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.440]   He's eternal, Hebrews 9, 14 says.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:06.480]   He has the power to seal believers so nothing can steal them and rob them of their salvation.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.440]   Only God can do that.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.800]   He dwells within believers, makes them His temple, and He has the power to make believers
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   new.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.000]   He washes away our sins, Titus 3, 5 says.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   He's God.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   It's not hard to find that He's God.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.680]   And one of my favorite examples of this is in Acts chapter 5.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.500]   You remember the story of Ananias and Sapphira?
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.140]   They kind of flaunt their big offering, but they held back.
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.200]   What does Peter say?
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.160]   Apostle Peter confronts them saying, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.800]   the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the proceeds of the land?"
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.240]   Don't do this, by the way, in your building campaign.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.560]   We're starting one in April.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.800]   I'm not going to go this far.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   "You have not lied to men but to God."
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:03.160]   Why would he say that unless the Holy Spirit was equally God?
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   He's God.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.640]   He's not the low man on the totem pole of the Trinity, not a lesser, he's not the JV
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.200]   benchwarmer, he's not the backup, he's not the minor leaguer, he's not the footnote,
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.480]   he's not the understudy.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:23.960]   So be careful in taking the John 16, 14, "He will glorify me" and turning that into, "Well,
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.920]   we don't really want to make a big deal about the Holy Spirit."
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.920]   No, you want to make a really big deal about His true work.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.880]   You don't want to turn Him into this shy, sort of background individual who doesn't
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.280]   really want to be talked about.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.240]   You've got to teach about Him, teach the whole counsel of God.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:50.300]   And yet, we don't need to go too far into sensationalism.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.560]   Number two, the person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.840]   Teach your people He is a person, and He's personal.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.240]   He's active in their life.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.680]   He's not a distant deity.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:08.560]   The Father loves you and calls you, Son died for you, calls on you to believe, John 11.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.680]   Then the Holy Spirit fills you, baptizes you in the body of Christ, fills you, transforms
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.040]   you, sanctifies you.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.120]   He's your helper every single day.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.240]   We don't want to forget His work, neglect His work, or misrepresent His work, especially
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:29.480]   with our churches, because He is the agent of salvation, and He's the agent of sanctification.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:35.600]   He's the one they desperately need, and the one whom Paul commands, "Walk by," who?
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   "The Spirit, and be filled with the Spirit."
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.720]   Don't ignore the God you need.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:56.600]   Is it weird if I look at you while you're taking a photo?
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:03.080]   The Holy Spirit doesn't exist to put the spotlight on me, He exists to put the spotlight on Christ.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.240]   We love you, Lucas.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.720]   So if the Holy Spirit's a person, what else does that mean?
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.760]   He's not an "it."
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.240]   Don't call Him an "it" in your prayers, don't model treating Him as an "it" in the way you
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:23.400]   minister, in the way we sing, in the way we talk, and guide your people, again, gently,
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:32.280]   lovingly, with compassion, with a purpose, when they call Him, by ignorance, an "it."
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:38.840]   You don't need to interrupt their prayer, but help them.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:45.420]   We don't call the Father an "it," we don't call Jesus an "it."
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:52.740]   I'm uncomfortable even giving examples by way of illustration.
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.640]   Why would we call the Holy Spirit an "it?"
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.600]   We ought not to.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:06.480]   In John 16, verses 1 through 15, we get the job description of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:15.960]   Jesus is preparing His disciples to see Him go, and He tells them what?
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.080]   It's to your advantage that I go.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.080]   Why?
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:26.560]   Well, because the Holy Spirit is going to carry out a ministry that is going to strengthen
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.520]   and equip and baptize and fill.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:36.800]   He's going to give them Scripture, lead them, guide them, comfort them, be their advocate,
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.400]   be the helper.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:44.080]   He's going to descend on them, if you will, and enter into them at Pentecost, and the
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:53.320]   gospel is going to go out explosively from the epicenter of His work in Jerusalem.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.960]   And when Jesus describes this, He does it in a very personal way.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.520]   He doesn't talk about a distant "it" or a force, but a person.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:10.080]   One of the most dangerous deviations in church history that continues to wreak havoc, even
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:18.440]   though people don't use the term, is Sibelianism, named for its namesake, Sibelius.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.080]   He taught that the Holy Spirit wasn't a person, but rather a force, an impersonal force, just
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.280]   an expression of God.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:32.240]   According to him, God is one person, He just expresses Himself in three different ways.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.360]   This view holds that God the Father was expressed in creation, God the Son through redemption,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.560]   and then God the Spirit in sanctification.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:45.360]   Eventually, the belief was declared a heresy, but it almost preaches pretty good, if you
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.560]   don't know the Bible.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.160]   We love steps and formulas.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.000]   God the Father was expressed in this way, God the Son in this way, God the Spirit in
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   this way.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.600]   That's why people get sucked into these things.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.320]   It sounds clever, but it is damning.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.800]   We need to teach well about His work.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.980]   He's a person.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:14.360]   The Bible describes more aspects of His personhood, comforter, helper, advocate, but there's more.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.040]   He feels, reveals, searches, and dwells.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.840]   He teaches, He helps, He prays, He speaks, He has a will, and He bears witness to our
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.080]   spirits that we are children of God.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.160]   He is an active person.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:33.340]   And third, the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.640]   The work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:40.040]   We need to teach our people, and this is just a short list, let me give you six, but I'll
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.600]   list a few at the end that you can add.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.800]   Regeneration.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.280]   Don't forget Him in your soteriology.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.680]   He's very much involved.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:29:03.200]   Titus 3, 4 to 7 explains this, "By the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:11.560]   whom He richly poured out upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, being justified
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.920]   by His grace, we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:20.680]   The Bible clearly teaches that the Holy Spirit's work is directly attached to and involved
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.920]   with rebirth, regeneration, being born again.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.320]   Number two, teach your people about sanctification and all of its aspects.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.160]   "The such were some of you, but you have been washed, you've been sanctified."
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.360]   Paul ends up saying it's by the Spirit of our God.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:41.160]   The Holy Spirit is the one sanctifying, and there's aspects to sanctification that your
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.680]   people need to understand, and this will be a comfort to them.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.040]   Probably talk to people weekly, if not at least monthly, somebody sending you an email
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:55.640]   or coming up to you after service or meeting you in the office and saying, "I feel so convicted."
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.960]   They're weeping after your sermon on what it means to be a true believer and what a
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:06.720]   true believer's life will look like, and they come to you and they are distraught.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:13.680]   And you either help them see they're absolutely right.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.520]   They've been a false convert, or what else do we do when we counsel that situation?
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:23.420]   We help them see that this besetting sin they're wrestling with, the fact that they're weeping
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:28.400]   over it and they hate it, and they're going to war against it, and they're seeking counsel
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:34.760]   for it, and they've come to talk to you about its effect on their heart and their life is
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.400]   part of progressive sanctification.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.880]   As the Word comes to bear on their soul, and they can't sleep until they come and meet
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.880]   with you.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.120]   They've got to tell you about this thing.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.080]   Unbelievers don't do that.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.160]   Unbelievers hide their sin, they love their sin, they relish in it and then try to look
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   perfect.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.120]   A believer who's experiencing progressive sanctification and the convicting work of
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.640]   the Holy Spirit and responding to that is someone that we bring comfort to.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.440]   So we want to help them understand the differences, and then when they say, "So when I sin, can
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.440]   I lose it?"
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.560]   I mean, you said, "I can't lose my salvation," but based on what you're teaching, if I have
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.680]   sin in my life or I'm not bearing fruit, I mean, unbelievers do that, and they kind of
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.920]   get all twisted up in their own thoughts and fears, you come along and say, "Let me help
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.760]   you understand three aspects of sanctification."
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.760]   There is positional.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.360]   You need to remember that, that you have been saved.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:31.480]   You went from sinner to saint in God's eyes based on your profession of faith and that
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   you've been bearing fruit.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.360]   You're a member here.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.840]   You don't need to every week be worried about losing it.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:45.960]   You can have assurance today, and you give them biblical assurance, not your own.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.880]   You all know we do not give people the assurance of salvation.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.620]   We point them to Scripture for their assurance of salvation.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.920]   They were a target of the Father's wrath and now they're a recipient of Christ's righteousness.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.920]   That's the gospel.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.580]   It's the good news.
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:02.580]   And then progressive.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.160]   It means you're not going to change into this perfect person overnight.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.280]   Talk to my friends who have been coming out of Nazarene churches.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.800]   They teach perfect sanctification.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   Some of you know that.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.920]   You navigate those issues.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.960]   And the idea that they're not going to be perfect yet.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.360]   So helpful last night when Piper, I think he's echoing something that a lot of older
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.880]   men and older pastors have said when you say, "What's the Lord teaching you at 80 years
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   old?"
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   I remember asking a man this one time.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.720]   He said, "Just how sinful I really am."
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.600]   I was like, "That's really encouraging."
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:43.520]   In 40 years I'm just going to realize that, yeah, you just see your heart.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.960]   Salvation is a gift and you love it and you're grateful to the Lord.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:51.380]   Now wait until you're 80 and you really know so much more about your wicked heart.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.760]   And you think, "He saved me?
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.400]   Wow.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.160]   He's changing us day by day, slowly but surely."
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.000]   Philippians 1:6 will come to pass.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.960]   Number three, perfect.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.960]   Perfect sanctification.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.960]   What is this?
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:05.960]   It's what awaits us in glory.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.880]   And you can talk to your people about the freedom from sin that awaits us.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.480]   That's why we long for heaven, to be with Christ and to not sin, and to have no separation
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:21.240]   from Him relationally, and to not be weighed down by all these encumbrances that slow us
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.160]   down in the race.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.640]   If you love Jesus, how many of you know you really hate sin?
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.640]   I hate it.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.640]   I can't stand my sin.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.640]   I don't love it.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.080]   I want to love Him all the more.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.200]   You talk to your people about the now but not yet promise that the day is coming.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.520]   Third, so regeneration, sanctification, illumination.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.680]   That without the Spirit's work through the Word, their eyes will not be opened.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.600]   I love what MacArthur says, "God must open the eyes of our understanding before we can
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.080]   truly know and rightly interpret His truth.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.120]   Only the Spirit can illumine Scripture."
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:03.000]   Martin Luther said, "Nobody who has not the Spirit of God sees a jot of what's in the
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Scriptures.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.520]   The Spirit is needed for understanding of all Scripture and every part of Scripture."
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.120]   So not only teach your people that, but brothers, we should be practicing that in our own study
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.300]   and in our own prayer life.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:18.680]   So my encouragement to you is don't neglect the work of the Spirit in your prayer life.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:25.760]   Don't forget before we study to ask His blessing on your study, His wisdom to pour out, James
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.320]   1:5 wisdom, which the Father will give.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.040]   And this is maybe a good, a great point of discussion with your own team and your own
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.800]   mind and you can do this study.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:40.080]   Some, this is one of those kind of open debates that can be debated, some would say that they
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.160]   feel very uncomfortable speaking directly to the Holy Spirit in their prayer life.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.400]   Those same people sing hymns to the Holy Spirit, I don't always know how those two things jive,
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.880]   but they don't necessarily want to say, "Holy Spirit, help me in my study."
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.440]   Okay, but don't forget Him altogether.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:05.080]   And others, they may say bluntly in line with His work, "Pray that the Holy Spirit would
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.200]   fill me for service to our church this weekend.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.560]   I pray that He'd bear His fruit.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.200]   I pray He'd give me eyes to see."
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.920]   However you pray, don't forget His work.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.260]   Now pray in line with biblical job descriptions.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.160]   We would never say, "Holy Spirit, thank You for dying for me."
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.240]   That doesn't make sense theologically.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.480]   We want to acknowledge the Father, the Son, and the Spirit's work through the Bible.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:39.720]   But many times, because we don't think about these things, we don't pray about these things.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:46.760]   So pray for His illuminating work, baptizing, filling, and sealing.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.000]   Three more aspects, baptizing, filling, and sealing.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.920]   I'll give you these in kind of a 60-second bundle, and then we'll get to Q&A.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.840]   People need to know the difference between the baptism and the filling of the Holy Spirit
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.840]   big time.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:11.440]   1 Corinthians 13, 12, real clear, sorry, 12, 13, that it is through one Spirit, by one
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.520]   Spirit, we're all baptized into the body.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.720]   So everybody gets the baptism of the Holy Spirit when they get saved.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.180]   It's not this secondary experience they need.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.040]   They're not on the JV team until they get it.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.040]   They're in.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.160]   He's in them.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:31.760]   And the filling, the Ephesians 5:18, "Be being kept filled," the ongoing action that's happening,
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.180]   that, yeah, there's one baptism and there could be many fillings.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.040]   That's a daily thing, by the way.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.040]   Why?
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.760]   Well, because what does it mean to be filled with the Spirit?
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.520]   It means to be yielded to Him.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:47.560]   I don't know about you, but I don't want that happening quarterly.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.420]   One annual conference, really felt like I got filled this weekend.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.640]   Maybe you were filled with a renewed zeal for the gospel.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.700]   Praise God.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:01.520]   And that can be accompanied by the Spirit's filling work.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.080]   I don't know how it all works.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   No one does.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.780]   He does what He does in us.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.760]   But what we do know objectively is that we want to be yielded daily.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.800]   So certainly you want to be filled with the Spirit ongoing.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.880]   You're either under the influence of something else or Him.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.320]   And then you think about Galatians 5, 16 and all the way to verse 23, "In the fruit of
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.040]   the Spirit," but start at 16.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.680]   And when Paul says, "Walk by the Spirit and you won't carry out the deeds of the flesh,"
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   what does walk mean?
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.520]   It's the Greek word peripateo, means to be preoccupied with.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.680]   So you fill your life up, your pursuits up, your recreations, your vacations, your work
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:44.080]   and your vocations, all of it with what is in line with the Spirit of God and His will,
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:48.280]   which of course will be aligned with the Word of God and helping you glorify Christ.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.840]   It's a preoccupation.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:55.960]   You should teach your people that so that they would view their work as still worship,
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.160]   everything under the glory of God.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:05.960]   When we're all filled up with Him, there's not a lot of room for much else.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.560]   I love the illustration, well-known evangelist D.L.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.560]   Moody is going to have a big service in England, pastors get together to talk about it.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.040]   Pastor stands up and protests, you know, "Why do we need this Mr. Moody?
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.560]   Who does he think he is?
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.560]   He's uneducated.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.320]   He's inexperienced.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.760]   What does he think he is, a monopoly on the Holy Spirit?"
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.400]   An older, wiser pastor stood up in that pastoral meeting and said, "No, but the Holy Spirit
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.880]   sure has a monopoly on him."
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.440]   That's what it means to be filled and yielded.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:41.120]   We want to model being monopolized by Him.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.360]   Number six, the sealing.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:47.800]   I already mentioned this so I won't have to go too far with it, but give your people the
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:57.780]   doctrine of eternal security and teach them how the Holy Spirit keeps them secure.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.440]   What a joy to know He's working.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.800]   That's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.600]   You can add His gifting, meaning the gifts of the Holy Spirit, worshiping in the Spirit,
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:14.100]   praying in the Spirit, conviction of the Holy Spirit, grieving, blaspheming, walking, unity,
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.100]   how He speaks today.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.320]   You could talk about His work in Scripture, get into bibliology.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:25.760]   All these things matter and they help your church have a fortified pneumatology.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.800]   It is good and right to preach Christ.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.140]   You ought to be all the time.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:35.940]   It's good and right to ensure people know their Father and love Him all the more and
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:36.940]   live for His glory.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:43.760]   It is also good and right that they have a clear understanding and personal relationship
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.800]   and daily communion with the Spirit of God.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.280]   He is in them.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.400]   They should be aware of His work.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.360]   Let's do questions.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.800]   We've got ten minutes and I'm going to take all of it.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.840]   Yes, sir?
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.840]   Hey, Philip.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:19.920]   How would you describe what a true biblical revival is to someone who has adopted more
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.920]   of a Charles Finney type perspective?
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.600]   How would I describe true revival to someone who's adopted more of a Charles Finney approach
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.600]   to it?
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:32.320]   I'd go to the book of Acts, explosive conversion, bold preaching, courageous evangelism, endurance
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:38.240]   through suffering, eternal perspective, joy, exuberant joy.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:48.200]   I'd go over to the Philippian jailbreak, Paul and Silas, and just show a generation, "Look,
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.200]   there it is.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   You're not sitting around."
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.720]   I mean, look, no offense at all.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.200]   We should sing all the more, and we do.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.200]   We're doing it in there.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.480]   I mean, I love, when Bob walked off last night, it was like the best walk off, better than
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.080]   any baseball walk off I've ever seen in my life.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.080]   Just walked off.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:08.880]   Those are moments where I would go, "Man, you want to talk about renewal or some revival,
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.000]   something awakening inside of the hearts of men as they go back and serve missionaries."
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.200]   I met a pastor today who when he goes back, he can get arrested.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.640]   He has to have his phone wiped before he goes back to his country.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:26.480]   I don't even want to say what country it is just in case, but, you know, that's revival.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.480]   That's renewal.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.320]   And then people's being saved because of that.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.440]   But you know, when you sit in a room and you feel really good, that's fine.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.200]   I feel good after this.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.280]   It's awesome.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.640]   It's what do you do after.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:45.300]   If I go to Chick-fil-A and then go play more Xbox at Asbury, that's great.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:50.200]   But if they're in their churches and there's a vibrancy, like we should see, if it were
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:57.640]   real revival, and I have my skepticisms about all that kind of stuff, but if we see an explosion
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:07.560]   in global missions and pastors, I just think it's a little less hyped and a little more
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.160]   of the long view.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:17.240]   It doesn't go away, but there'll be a steadiness to it, if that makes sense.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:22.040]   >> [Question inaudible]
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:31.320]   >> [Question inaudible]
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:57.960]   He said his brother-in-law says the gift of healing and these things in 1 Corinthians,
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.920]   they're available.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:05.680]   That would be one of those conversations that you just have privately and personally with
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.680]   them.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.040]   I don't think that's just some terrible heresy.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.960]   It's a misunderstanding, but it's available.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.200]   What it does is it makes us feel good about them being available to us, and now we're
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.000]   not taking a hard stance on something, which is kind of this generation's MO.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.480]   We want to just live in the middle and make it feel good for everyone, like they're available.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.280]   It also makes us feel more in control.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:32.200]   And, I mean, I don't want to dismantle his view in a cheeky way or a rude way, but it
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.720]   makes us feel more in control.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   It's there.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.720]   They're available.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.280]   I just need to step out and do what?
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.080]   I would ask him truly, genuinely, "So, how do I get them then?
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.040]   You know, how do I get Justin Peters out of his scooter?"
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:52.200]   Not being funny, like, "How do I help that family in my church and deal with the stage
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.080]   four cancer if they're available?"
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:59.240]   You know, I'd rather just pray for someone to be healed and then say, "Lord, we trust
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.280]   Your will in the matter, no matter what."
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:07.120]   You know, there was nothing available for Tim Chalice when sweet boy Nick dropped dead
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.280]   at 20 a few years ago on the podcast, not this Monday, but next Monday.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:17.200]   Tim is coming on the For the Gospel podcast for three weeks, and he's telling the story.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.720]   And I just think of Tim, and I go, "What didn't work for him?"
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.720]   They tried to revive him.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.960]   I mean, he was at Southern Seminary.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.200]   I guess they're Baptists, right?
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.240]   So they didn't get the power of God in that moment.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.240]   I don't know.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.880]   That's what we used to think when I was in the charismatic movement.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.920]   So I think it gets touchy and dangerous because how do you get them?
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.120]   But I would dialogue with him on that.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.880]   But the fact that you're in a solid church and you're in his life, that's a gift from
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.880]   the Lord to him.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.880]   What else?
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:44.880]   Yes, sir.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.880]   You're standing.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:46.880]   I got to go to you.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:45:06.400]   Okay, on top of all that conspiracy theories, that one might have to wait.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:13.720]   Jeff Williams isn't here, but we can talk about the moon landing later and chemtrails
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.800]   and flat earth.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.960]   Stay off YouTube is probably some of the best advice unless you're watching John MacArthur
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.280]   sermons.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.000]   Okay.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.920]   Your original question was about reaching family.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.920]   Okay.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:40.520]   Let me try to give you this in like 60, 120 seconds, be easier.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:46.240]   First expect a diverse response just like in church.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.960]   Some will be saved, some will be interested in what you're saying and assessing, and others
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.080]   will be angry and it will irk them.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.440]   I'll give you examples.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:04.600]   When I told my family members that I've come to faith and that I've come to the realization,
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.560]   literally said this to a room of multiple individuals, we'll leave it at that, "You're
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:15.520]   all wolves, but if you'll just repent, like this could all be fixed."
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.000]   Literally what I said, like 12 years ago or something.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:26.040]   And I had a McCarthy study Bible, true story, black goatskin leather, it was open, I was
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.040]   in 1 Timothy 3.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.280]   I was like, "Can I just read you this?"
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.740]   And they're just like gnashing of teeth, you know?
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:37.880]   And I read all the qualifications, it was the longest reading I've ever done in my life
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:43.840]   of such a short span of verses, and I looked up and said, "You're none of these, none of
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:49.920]   you are, but I've got friends, they would love to walk with you."
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.400]   They're like, "Oh, here we go," you know?
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.320]   You've got to expect that with some.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.320]   That's how it started.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:47:00.000]   If I could do like a meme, you know, how it started, how it's going, there's some...how
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.360]   it started, it was really rough.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.120]   I got cut off for years, ridiculed.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:09.120]   I'm still today, I don't get invited to anything, you know, none of that.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:13.560]   But some of my family members are circling around with me, and I talk to them.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:18.600]   I'm going to go visit a few of them in April, non-heretics, but definitely used to be, and
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.160]   they're in that, and they're like assessing things.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.920]   So I want to have those dialogues, but some will never talk to me.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   And part of that is, you know, I brought the heat, I think, early on when I was in cage
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   stage.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.240]   So I was ready to just, you know, burn them all, but then throw cold water and go, "Now,
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.240]   let me help you."
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.520]   You know, like, "I'll just manage them up after you beat them up."
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.040]   And that would be my...that's where I failed so bad.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.960]   Like, in God, greed, and the prosperity gospel, one of the last chapters is reaching people
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   caught in deception.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.960]   None of that's like expertise.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.240]   Look at me, ivory tower.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.360]   It's man, I failed so bad.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.160]   No one told me about cage stage, but I was definitely in it.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.280]   So I would say, try to keep as many bridges as you can built for conversation where you
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.680]   influence them, not the other way around, and understand that some are in that third
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.460]   category in Jude.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.560]   Have mercy on others with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.720]   I'm not having steak dinners with my uncle to like, "I just want to explain."
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.360]   No, I'm not being rude.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.840]   Just like Francis Chan, like, "I'm going to win them from the inside," and not like, "No,
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:24.320]   you need to win them from the shoreline, throw the rope, and pull them out of the river."
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.000]   You don't go jump in and be like, "Hey, guys, I'm here to help you."
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.960]   And then we're all looking going, "What are you doing?"
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.320]   You save, you reach by what?
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.320]   The verses prior in Jude 17 through 23, snatching them out of the fire.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:41.200]   So you want to stay safe and careful with some, but if you've got family that aren't
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:47.720]   like flaming heretics, try to have as much interaction with them in love with the truth
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.920]   as you can, and then trust the Lord.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.640]   Let me get one more.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:57.800]   Verse 59, "Brother with the glasses."
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:11.880]   Yeah, yes, okay, one of the best.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:17.720]   If you just wanted to kind of give a menu, Greg Gilbert's "What is the Gospel?"
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.360]   You know that little hardcover?
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:27.200]   It's just a great book, doesn't attack heretics, doesn't name any names, it's about the gospel.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.060]   That would be a good one.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:33.520]   If you...if they're tolerant of John MacArthur, try to get them like "Vanishing Conscience,"
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.260]   some things about sin and soteriology, one of the most interesting conversations I had
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.460]   with this guy who's kind of in that whole world.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.000]   He said, I sent him my book, and he said, "You know, I don't agree with you on some
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   things."
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   I said, "Yeah, obviously."
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.080]   And then he said, "But that whole section on soteriology, whatever it's called, I'm
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.080]   like, 'Yeah, you got it right.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.080]   Good job.'"
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.760]   Probably one of the first times he's ever used that word, I'm not kidding.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.400]   He said, "We're really shallow in that."
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.760]   And I was like, "There's a good entry point.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:05.840]   If I can get him to understand the gospel, I can get to, 'Hey, your prophets are absolutely
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.200]   of Baal,' you know?
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.120]   But let me get the gospel first to you."
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.880]   And so that would be an interesting one.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.520]   You know another one would be Tom Schreiner, "Spiritual Gifts."
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.720]   He is so nice to Pentecostals in that book.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:23.040]   My friend, Wayne Grudem, my friend, Sam Storms, my friend...he doesn't say friends to heretics,
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.840]   but he's, you know, my friend.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:32.000]   He is so irenic and so kind, it is hard not to say, "Yeah, the guy's kind of right.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.760]   That makes sense."
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.640]   I wrote "Knowing the Spirit" to be nice.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.840]   There's no heresy hunting in it.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.600]   And then one other book, I know this seems self-promoting, but it's actually based on
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:47.440]   my burning down of everything for the first two years.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:53.000]   I wrote a book called "More Than a Healer" about Jesus, and it's not...there were people
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.440]   that actually reviewed it and were like, "Man, what, are you going soft?"
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.840]   I'm like, "No, I'm trying to give people something that they can give to someone, and the first
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.520]   line isn't, you know, about their favorite false teacher."
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.880]   That one's just about Jesus and all the other things that He is.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:11.080]   I would try to get them a devotional, a good biblical devotional.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:15.160]   If you can introduce them to Spurgeon, that's always helpful, like a morning and evening.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.960]   I have some things I've leaked in.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:23.280]   I've sent my mother a few books that really put cracks in the dam, but I was never like,
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.720]   "You need to read this, that."
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:30.320]   So hopefully, there's probably more that I would say.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.480]   You know who's really good?
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.120]   Last one, and then I know we got to go.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:37.200]   But Allie Beth Stuckey is kind of a sleeper, fellas.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.520]   Let me explain this.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:46.120]   My sister, who is way caught up in some weird stuff, shoots me a message like a year and
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:51.360]   a half ago, and she was like, "Hey, I saw that you were with Allie Beth Stuckey at a
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.360]   women's conference."
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.360]   I was like, "Yeah."
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   She was like, "She's my favorite."
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   I'm like, "Yes!"
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.920]   You know, I never realized that.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.760]   And then she said, "Yeah, I think we'd agree on more things than we used to now.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.760]   We should talk."
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   I was like, "Thank God for Allie Beth."
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.480]   She's not just a political pundit at this point.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.040]   She kind of throws some theology around.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.800]   She defends pastors, but that she's drawing in.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:20.960]   So her book, "You're Not Enough and That's Okay," it is anti-everything that their women's,
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.140]   Lisa Bevere and all these women's ministries are pumping.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:30.400]   She's like, there's Sadie Robinson and Christine Kane and Lisa Bevere, and then there's Allie
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   Beth.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   They're like, "You're enough.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.400]   You're you.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   We love you."
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.680]   And she's like, "You're not enough and that's okay."
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.680]   And then she points to Christ.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.400]   It's a pink book.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.320]   Getting one of those to a sister would be a good idea.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   This was fun, guys.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.320]   I hope it was helpful.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:45.440]   So thanks for letting me talk.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.600]   (audience applauding)
