[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.820]   All right, we got a question here from Candace.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.520]   Candace says, "Do you have any tips
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.100]   "for how to apply the deep work approach
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.440]   "to job seeking for a first job?
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.440]   "I'm feeling overwhelmed with all the options out there
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.160]   "and I don't know what metrics actually reflect
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.740]   "the efficiency of my search."
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.000]   All right, well, Candace, you're over-defining
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.640]   the word deep work.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.920]   This is a common theme on the show
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.360]   that people will expand the term deep work
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.700]   to capture all sorts of different things.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.860]   But let's keep it really focused.
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.160]   Deep work means I'm working on something difficult
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.560]   without distraction, so I'm not context shifting
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.820]   and giving it my full attention.
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.900]   And the whole idea behind deep work is
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.800]   that is the most effective cognitive state
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.160]   to produce non-trivial or valuable work,
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.440]   is giving something your full attention
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.780]   and not context shifting.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.760]   That really has nothing to do with organizing a job search.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.700]   What I think what you mean here is how do I do this
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.440]   in a way that is deep in the more general sense,
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.040]   meaning focusing on what matters,
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.280]   giving that intense intention
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.360]   and not wasting your time with things that don't.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.760]   That general application of deep,
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.180]   I think is quite appropriate here.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.960]   What I'm gonna recommend is what years ago,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.640]   I'm talking 2007, when I was blogging
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.280]   mainly at a student audience.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.520]   And I'd introduced this notion called the textbook method
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.800]   where when you're trying to master something complicated
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.520]   and non-trivial, you should approach the challenge
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.080]   like you're writing a book about it.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.720]   Let me go gather information about this,
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.520]   organize my thoughts and actually write it out
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.600]   like a little book.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.840]   Do that about your job search.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.280]   I wanna write a book on, in your case,
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.920]   it's biomedical engineering,
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.080]   on how to get your first job in biomedical engineering.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.640]   Won't be a long book, but something I feel good about.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.440]   Well, how am I gonna write this book?
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.320]   Well, I better go learn about how do you succeed
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.920]   in doing your first job search in biomedical engineering.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.000]   Well, how do I do that?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.880]   I guess I should go talk to people.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.520]   Let me talk to the seniors from last year
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.080]   who were in my program and got good jobs.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.360]   Let me talk to three of them
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.040]   and walk them through their job process
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.280]   and then have them reflect what mattered and what didn't.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.720]   If they had to do it again, what would they focus on?
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.240]   Why don't you go to the career services center
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.680]   at my university and talk through job searching for this.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680]   Let me go to a career fair,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.720]   maybe talk to one of the reps from one of these firms
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.840]   and say, let me ask you, when you're hiring,
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.920]   how's this work on the other end?
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.760]   What matters?
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.680]   What are you looking for?
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.840]   Get the real information and organize it and write it down.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.760]   Not a full length book,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.160]   but like you're putting together a pamphlet
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.040]   that's evidence-based on here's the right way
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.520]   to job search in my field to get a first job
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.800]   and then go execute that.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.360]   And that's almost always the key to taking this
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.360]   general deep approach to things in your life.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.760]   If you want to focus your energy intensely on what matters,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.080]   not waste time on things that don't.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   You got to know what matters and that requires evidence.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.200]   And keep in mind, reality is often
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.240]   not what you want it to be.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.240]   If you say, I'm just going to make up what I want
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.000]   to matter for job searching,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.640]   you will come up with something that you like.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.040]   It's hard, but not too hard.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.280]   Doesn't, you know, whatever,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.200]   but it might not have any connection to the real world
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.080]   and what really matters.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.840]   So I really like this deep approach to almost anything,
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.480]   but it requires an evidence-based approach.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.880]   So that's my advice, Candace.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.720]   Basically go do the research to write a book
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.880]   on how to do biomedical job searching
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.680]   and then execute that plan.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.720]   That's how you're going to be confident
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.040]   that you're doing the right thing.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.060]   (upbeat music)
