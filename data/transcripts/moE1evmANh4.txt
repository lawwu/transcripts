[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.280]   - Happy Friday, I hope you had a wonderful week.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.720]   As you might've noticed,
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.200]   we've been picking on men recently on the podcast,
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.540]   talking about how a man's anger destroys the home,
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.420]   or how a man's lust wreaks havoc on his marriage.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.040]   We looked at the major fallout of one man's decision
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.720]   to abandon his wife and daughters,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.120]   and we've addressed unbelieving men twice in recent episodes.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.400]   So what about women?
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.920]   We end this week with an international question,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.000]   which I love, because our international listeners
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.260]   are willing to ask questions
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.740]   that don't get asked by anyone here in the States.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.560]   We take it, we pose it, we answer it, and we publish it.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.720]   And very often those episodes prove interesting
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.160]   to international listeners
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.640]   and to our local listeners as well.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.620]   I could give you some very specific examples
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.120]   of how this has played out in the past
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.640]   on interracial marriage episodes, for example,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.480]   but instead, let's just get into today's question
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480]   from an international listener, a woman,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.960]   who writes this, "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.840]   I have been hearing from Christians around me
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.620]   that women are more sinful than men.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.800]   I know from my daily ungodly thoughts and actions
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.440]   how sinful I am, but as a mother of boys and girls,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.480]   does the Bible teach that I should teach my girls
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.320]   they are more sinful than boys?
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.600]   I know the Bible says we all have sinned
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.660]   and come short of the glory of God,
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.400]   but Eve, Delilah, Samson's wives, Solomon's wives,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.000]   Potiphar's wife, these have been listed to me
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.760]   as proof that women are more evil than men are.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.000]   Is it true?"
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.720]   - I think it would be a huge mistake
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.840]   to raise our children with the assumption
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.760]   that our daughters are by nature more sinful
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.380]   or more prone to sin than our sons.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.000]   Now, let me give you at least six reasons
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.800]   why that would be both misleading and harmful.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.360]   First, in response to the argument that Eve, Delilah,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.880]   Solomon's wives, Potiphar's wife,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   prove that women are more sinful than men,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.060]   consider how utterly lopsided that observation is.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.500]   When, for example, there were far more wicked kings
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.140]   in the Old Testament than wicked queens,
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.320]   and all the Pharisees and Sadducees
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.800]   and high priests and scribes that Jesus indicted
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.880]   with such deep sinfulness were all men, all of them.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.520]   And if you were to make a list
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.520]   of especially wicked people in the Bible,
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.280]   my goodness, the number of men on that list
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   would far outnumber the number of women on that list.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.400]   So even if you should focus on those relationships
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.520]   where the woman sins, especially pointed out,
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.700]   there's no evidence, for example,
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.100]   that Potiphar was any less sinful
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.240]   than his wife in the way he treated Joseph,
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.240]   or that Samson was any less of a sinful dupe
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.380]   than Delilah was devious.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.440]   So any attempt to argue for the greater sinfulness
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.680]   of women statistically from the Bible is doomed to failure.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.120]   That's first argument.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.000]   Number two, if someone wants to use statistics
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.680]   against males and females, oh my goodness,
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.080]   they've got this to contend with.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.080]   In America today, 93% of everyone who's in prison is a man.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.280]   93% of all prisoners are men.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.440]   Of all the people arrested each year, 73% are men.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.600]   Of all those convicted of violent crimes, 80% are men.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.240]   Of all the rapes that are reported,
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.040]   the one forcing the other is 99% of the time a man.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.160]   Of all the homicides that are committed,
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.040]   89% are committed by men.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.320]   Of all those arrested for robbery, 87% are men.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.060]   Of all those arrested for arson, 83% are men.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.960]   This is devastating, right?
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.000]   I feel horrible just saying it.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.920]   If statistics are going to prove anything,
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.600]   we're gonna be hard put to say
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.280]   that women are more sinful than men.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.040]   My goodness.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.020]   Third observation, third argument.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.200]   When you look at the principal statements
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.120]   about human depravity in the Bible,
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.000]   what you find is that human beings without distinction
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.240]   between male and female are said to be
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.800]   under the power of sin.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.760]   For example, Romans 3, Paul sums up his indictment
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.720]   of the human race in chapters one to three by saying,
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.720]   "I have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.240]   "are under sin as it is written,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.360]   "none is righteous, no, not one."
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.460]   And verse 23, "All have sinned
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.000]   "and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.480]   In Romans 5.12, 5.18, "As sin came into the world
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.880]   "through one man," man, by the way, not Eve, man,
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.440]   "and death through sin, and so death spread to all men,
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.300]   "so all have sinned.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.080]   "One trespass led to condemnation for all men."
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.360]   That is all persons.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.480]   There is no effort in any of this to say
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.200]   that the corruption we inherited from Adam, not Eve,
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.240]   is worse in women.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   Fourth, maybe the most commonly cited text
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.560]   to ascribe to woman a greater sinfulness or proneness to sin
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.520]   is the role of Eve that she played in the fall in Genesis 3
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.120]   and what Paul says about it in 1 Timothy 2.12 and 13.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.560]   He says, "I do not permit a woman to teach
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.320]   "or to exercise authority over a man.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   "Rather, she is to remain quiet."
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.260]   And then he gives two reasons for why he says that.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:21.400]   One, "For Adam was created, was formed first, then Eve."
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.860]   That's number one.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.240]   Number two, "Adam was not deceived,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.480]   "but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor."
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.040]   Here's what I think Paul means.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.400]   Adam was formed first means that there are
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   at least seven or eight pointers, exegetical pointers,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   in the first couple of chapters of Genesis
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.160]   that, like this one here, temporal priority,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.520]   Adam first, Eve second, these pointers
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.520]   that man was meant by God to bear a special kind
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.640]   of responsibility and leadership in relation to the woman.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.960]   Paul infers, therefore, that giving the role of an elder
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.800]   or overseer to men accords with God's design.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.160]   That's his first argument.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   And then the reference to Eve being deceived, not Adam,
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.640]   is, I think, a reference to the fact that Satan assaulted
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.600]   and undermined the God-given leadership role of Adam
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.560]   by snubbing him, ignoring him, as he stood there
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.360]   with his wife during the temptation.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.080]   And Genesis 3, 6 makes it very clear he was standing
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.320]   with her as Satan was interacting with her
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.880]   and bringing down the relationship.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.500]   He was there with her.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:53.960]   So Satan was ignoring the leader, snubbing him,
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.160]   and instead speaking to the woman who was to be protected
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.680]   by the leader if he had been stepping up
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.040]   to do what he ought to do.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.800]   And the point of the text, I think,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   is that the disaster that followed is owing to this assault
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.920]   on the God-given roles of man and woman
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   as Eve was made the spokesman and Adam abdicated his role
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.120]   as protector and leader.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.120]   Now, which of those sins, hers or his, is worse?
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.720]   The text doesn't say.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.720]   There was a peculiar sense in which Satan targeted her
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.160]   in the face of him for deception, and they both bought it.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.240]   He passively, she actively.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.240]   Fifth, when Paul does describe unnatural female sin,
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:58.260]   he does it in perfect parallel with unnatural male sin.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.520]   For example, Romans 1, 26 to 27,
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.800]   God gave them up to dishonorable passions.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.960]   Their women exchanged natural relations
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.640]   for those that are contrary to nature and parallel.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   Their men likewise gave up natural relations with women
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.560]   and were consumed with passion for one another,
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.800]   men committing shameless acts with men
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.220]   and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.980]   We don't come away from this text thinking
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.920]   that Paul saw in men or women a greater bent to sin,
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.880]   even a sin that's against nature.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.880]   Sixth, my last reason for saying we should not raise our kids
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.640]   with the assumption that our daughters are, by nature,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.080]   more sinful or more prone to sin than our sons
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.880]   is that there's a better way.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.520]   There's a better way to prepare them
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   for the peculiar male temptations to sin
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.040]   and the peculiar female temptations to sin.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.000]   The better way is to teach them what it means
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.760]   for sons to grow up and be godly men and not women
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.160]   and for the daughters to grow up
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.440]   and be godly women and not men,
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.200]   and then to show them that manhood and womanhood
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   really are beset because of our fallen nature
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.760]   with temptations that are peculiar to being a man,
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.880]   peculiar to being a woman,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.620]   and we need to prepare our kids for this.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.680]   They need to know what's peculiar about a man,
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.000]   what's peculiar about a woman,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.400]   and then what temptations might touch them
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.480]   peculiarly different from the opposite sex.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   For example, you might say that each has sexual longings,
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:03.840]   men and women, the man's superior strength
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.840]   might tempt him to use that force
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.000]   to get what he wants sinfully, called rape,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.200]   instead of using his strength to protect
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.600]   and to care for the woman,
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.960]   and the woman being the weaker vessel,
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.360]   as Peter describes it, might tempt her.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.040]   Her temptation might be peculiar to that weakness
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.160]   in that she's more subtle and manipulative
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.000]   to get what she wants.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.480]   So there are differences between male and female,
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.160]   and there are therefore different temptations
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.140]   that they might face.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.660]   Or you might say that because man has
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.600]   a special responsibility to be
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.920]   the sacrificial loving leader,
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.760]   he might be tempted to neglect that responsibility
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.080]   and be passive, a couch potato,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.680]   and the woman might be tempted to grasp
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.040]   after that leadership and become domineering.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.080]   Or you might say that since the husband
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.920]   is designed by God to be a father
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.820]   and the wife is designed by God to be a mother,
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:15.240]   he might be tempted to sinfully father his wife
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.840]   as a daughter, and she might be sinfully tempted
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.960]   to mother her husband as a son,
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.200]   and thus both of them demean and offend
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.440]   the other in different ways.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.880]   In other words, yes, we teach our children
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.920]   that they are sinners, and yes,
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.520]   we teach them that there are peculiar temptations
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.520]   to sin that come differently to men and women,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.040]   and they are not always the same,
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   but it does no good to try to tally up
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.340]   somehow who has the deeper depravity.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.400]   It is so deep in both of us
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.780]   that we have plenty of work to do
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.600]   without claiming that we are better or worse
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.480]   because of being a man or a woman,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.680]   and we can be thankful that if we trust him,
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.120]   Jesus has died for us and covers all of our sins,
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.240]   the ones that are the same
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.360]   and the ones that are peculiar to us.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.880]   - Thank you, Pastor John, and international listeners,
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.720]   those of you outside the United States,
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.200]   thank you for sending your questions to us.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.240]   You see the world very differently than we see it,
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.680]   so we need you to keep asking great questions
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.120]   and sending them in to us, which you can do right now
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.120]   through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.840]   We now break for the weekend.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.040]   I am your host, Tony Reike, and Pastor John,
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.800]   and I will see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.840]   Thanks for listening.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
