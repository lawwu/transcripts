[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120]   So this is our financial planning experts panel.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.680]   I'm delighted to have four people here who have been with us in other sessions already
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:25.440]   during the conference, Mike Piper, Alan Roth, Anne Garcia, and John Luskin.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.600]   Please look at their bios on the website.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   Look at their websites.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.440]   There is so much wonderful information.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.740]   I wanted to start with Mike earlier today did a session that was intended for the less
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:50.720]   involved spouses in our couples to tell them about what they most need to do in financial
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.720]   planning.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.400]   And there were so many people in this room, and that was very early on our third day together,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.320]   which I think is a testament to how much value there is there.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.720]   So I wanted to just start by asking Mike to give us a quick synopsis of his message for
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.160]   the less involved spouses, and therefore the related message for those of you who are the
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.240]   more involved spouse in the family finances.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.240]   Sure.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.600]   The very short summary, since I know that most of you are here for that, is that obviously
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.400]   those of us who are the financial manager for the household, we want the other person
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.120]   to be ready if they have to take over that responsibility at some point.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.480]   That's one of the most common questions I receive.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.640]   And so encouraging them to, the way my spouse and I do it, is just a once a month money
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.720]   talk, and it's not all of our personal finances, just one topic at a time.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.720]   This month we talk about this.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   Next month we talk about that.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.000]   So it doesn't take forever.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.320]   It's not a big thing to try to get them to do.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.200]   And it gets easier over time because, of course, you know, next time you talk about life insurance,
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.360]   there's not much that's different than last time you talked about it.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.760]   And the other important point is that getting that input from your partner, even if they're
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.920]   not the one who does most of the financial planning, is super, super valuable because
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.960]   they're going to be able to relate other things going on in your life that maybe you haven't
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.080]   thought about and haven't included in your financial planning.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.080]   And so it's going to be valuable to you.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.800]   And if you can encourage them to take on that role of oversight, is what I call it.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.640]   They're the oversight committee.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.360]   Encouraging them to take on that role, that, from what I've seen, can help get them involved
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.080]   in a way that they might not be if it's just you teaching them stuff, I guess is what I
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080]   would say.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.080]   I'll just start off by saying I'm glad you didn't call those gatherings the money date
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.040]   because that has always kind of made me cringe.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.740]   I wanted to ask you, I will start with Mike, but I think probably this goes for the whole
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.620]   panel, is when you talk with people, what are the gaps you often find that you think
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.200]   people, couples, need to address?
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.680]   It's going to vary, obviously, depending on life stage and so on, but the one I always
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.820]   mention every year is disability insurance, just because it's critically important, right?
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.080]   For some reason, people know that life insurance is important, but don't always know that disability
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.560]   insurance is important.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.360]   And so you'd be surprised, maybe you wouldn't be surprised, but there's lots of people who
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.840]   just don't have that coverage, even though they're very much dependent on their income
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.840]   from work.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.080]   And so that's the number one thing that I see, they simply don't have coverage in that
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.080]   area.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.580]   I know when I talked to John before the conference, and he was saying when he does his planning,
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.200]   he will often start off by highlighting some areas for urgent action.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.120]   And I think it's really interesting, when we talk about investing, is that's the part
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.080]   of personal finance that often seems urgent and timely, because the markets did something
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.120]   today, and interest rates are where they are, and things are always changing, but he was
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.520]   saying that the urgent list is typically not investing, so why don't you tell us what those
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.780]   tend to be?
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.400]   Yeah, so disability insurance is usually going to be on that list, at least if you're pre
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.600]   retiree, life insurance is also going to be a big one that's on that list.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.580]   Doing your estate planning, and then as well as the formal estate planning, meet with an
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.440]   estate attorney, create the will, the advanced healthcare directive, the power of attorney,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.000]   et cetera, you want to create an informal estate planning document, and this is something
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.160]   that can actually be put together in the process of the meetings that Mike mentioned, you just
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.980]   want to create a resource for each other, especially that non-involved spouse, but then
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.060]   also your trusted party, so that contingent attorney, in fact, that's the person you entrust
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.080]   on your power of attorney document to handle your finances when you're not able to.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.620]   Having that resource, that emergency letter, listing out, hey, here's the professionals
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.820]   I'm working with, here's where all my accounts are, how to access them, here's my different
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.720]   insurance policies, putting that stuff together makes way more of a difference than whether
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.320]   you have a tips fund, or a bond ladder, or anything else.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.480]   Personal insurance as well, that's something that always makes page one urgent and important
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.920]   projects for the documents that I put together when working with folks.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.440]   Investments rarely ever make it on that list.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.680]   Maybe if they've got a really concentrated stock position, maybe if they're invested
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.260]   really aggressively, but otherwise, investing is just not going to be an important and urgent
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.520]   project for most folks.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.960]   Alan, Jeff?
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.200]   All of these areas are incredibly important, and I won't work with a client unless both
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:42.480]   spouses are going to be involved, but my clients also tend to be, I would argue, better than
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.880]   most financial planners, and what I look at is people tend to be overinsured.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.360]   For instance, the doctor at 63 years old that has disability, they've been paying the same
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.840]   rate for 30 years, and guess what?
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.560]   If they became disabled today, they'd have a three, six-month waiting period and only
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.360]   collect about a year.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.640]   You want to look at insurance.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.120]   Are you adequately insured?
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.760]   Insurance companies are not not-for-profits.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.880]   Even mutuals have to make a profit, so don't buy insurance you don't need.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.160]   I don't have my iPhone insured, for instance.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.200]   I don't have collision on my car.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.640]   I have an umbrella.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:34.060]   Ann, you had shared that your twins recently graduated from college and that they are both
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:42.880]   gainfully employed, so congratulations on that.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.360]   I'd like to talk about, for people who are at that stage in life, early 20s, first jobs,
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.040]   what are the lessons that you would share with those individuals, or it could be with
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.600]   people here who want to help their children or their grandchildren.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.200]   What should people at that stage be doing to get their financial lives off to a solid
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.200]   start?
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.600]   Yeah, we're very much in the thick of that right now in my family.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.560]   I think one of the things that young adults need to pay a lot more attention to than they
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.400]   maybe already think is their credit score.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.640]   I always tell young adults that your credit score is like your GPA of your adult life.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.000]   It's equally important.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.720]   Having good credit will save you so much money over time, and also they need to understand
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.120]   that credit scores have nothing to do with your income.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:45.160]   You can have a very high income and a very low credit score, but good credit is built
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.800]   through using credit.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.400]   One way that parents can help their young adults to build credit is by adding them as
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.880]   an authorized user on your credit card.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.440]   That doesn't mean giving them a credit card, but it does mean that your good credit gets
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.240]   reported to their credit history.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.640]   It's kind of a free way that you can help your kids build credit.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.800]   I talk to so many young adults who can't get a credit card with more than a $500 credit
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.600]   limit, which does not even buy you an airfare.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.320]   They're regularly going home after a night out and making a credit card payment.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.760]   Credit scores are an important thing for young adults to think about.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.720]   Emergency savings are another frequently overlooked area, and so I've been encouraging my kids
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.520]   to put 10 percent of their income into a savings account until they build it up to a certain
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   level.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:39.520]   Then, of course, once you get a job, taking advantage of all your benefits.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.480]   If your employer offers a 401(k) match, think of that match as part of your salary, and
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.840]   the way you earn that part of your salary is contributing to your 401(k).
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.520]   That's kind of the three-legged stool, emergency savings, long-term savings, and paying attention
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   to credit.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:06.720]   Anyone else have other things they want to emphasize for an early career?
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.040]   Just get in the habit of savings.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.800]   When I was a kid, we didn't have a total stock index fund with a 0.03 percent expense
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.480]   ratio.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.400]   It helps the simplicity.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.400]   You can keep that simplicity for the rest of your lives.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:27.360]   I can't get to simplicity because of tax ramifications I have.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.240]   Do it on an automated basis.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.320]   You get used to, by the way—when Michelle Singletary's kids were talking about how the
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.000]   portfolio went down, it hurts a whole lot less when you're young and have less investment
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.680]   capital and more human capital than it does later on.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   Get into the habit.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.080]   Harness inertia.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:51.340]   Give part of your raises to yourself in terms of savings.
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.600]   Have it automatically taken to the 401(k).
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.320]   Never miss the employer match, et cetera.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.080]   It's a great time for young people in financial planning right now.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.760]   To talk a little bit more about credit, Clark Howard, he has a great resource on freezing
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.880]   your credit, so that's going to be an important part of maintaining a good credit score.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.560]   Just Google "Clark Howard credit freeze," and that can give you a resource on going
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.000]   down that path if you guys haven't already frozen your credit.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.080]   I know one of the other things Clark mentioned was about the Roth IRAs for young adults and
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.360]   early on offering a match from the bank of mom and dad.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   That is something I did.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.520]   Again, it's a way to introduce that habit.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.200]   I know, Ann, you had also said about setting up Roth IRAs early, right?
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   I was going to say, one of the best things you can do is set up a Roth IRA while your
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.440]   kid's a teenager, because then you can set it up as a custodial account, and you don't
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.960]   have to wait for them to do it.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.640]   Once they turn 18, they have to do it themselves.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:59.200]   If you've ever been the parent of an 18-year-old, you might know that that is hard.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:06.920]   It's not just that it's hard for them to do, it's just that they have no concept of thinking
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   of things.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.480]   I think Michelle's family is that rare group where her young adult kids are actually thinking
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.720]   long-term with their money.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.080]   Most 18-year-olds don't do it that way.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.920]   If you can get that set up while they're 16, when they have their first paycheck and get
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.360]   some money into it and get it invested, that is a tremendous gift to give your kids, because
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.680]   then that means that account is there and ready and waiting for them when they get to
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.480]   the point where they have the money to do it themselves.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:45.120]   Let me say what I forgot to say starting off, that Rick Ferry is walking around collecting
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.280]   questions, so please share your questions with us.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:56.600]   In this session, we're going to try and stay on the non-investing parts of personal finance,
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.880]   so I know there are still a gazillion questions out there about tips and bond ladders, but
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.360]   I think we're going to not go there.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.880]   We're going to try and do everything else.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.880]   It's interesting.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.760]   We're talking about these different themes throughout the conference.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   One theme is starting off right early in your financial life, and then another theme we've
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:27.040]   talked about is a bit later on when many people have gotten to a strong financial position
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   moving forward from there.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:35.840]   Alan, you wrote a piece earlier this year entitled "How to Get Clients to Spend More
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   Money."
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   Tell us about that.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.720]   Did anyone here frugal like me?
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:50.040]   We were frugal because we were afraid of running out of money, and we needed to build a portfolio.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.400]   The thought of spending it down is incredibly scary.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:03.200]   Even though likely we have more than enough, a Japan could happen, hyperinflation.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:10.280]   I'm going to use an example of somebody who is extreme, me.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.200]   How to spend more money?
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:19.040]   The first thing I did is—I'm really sorry, but I built a tips ladder.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.840]   Bill mentioned he counts his tips at night.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.720]   $1,076, that's what I have.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   Between that tips ladder and Social Security, which I've delayed, of course, I've got a
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.000]   six-figure income coming in, and that is a license to spend.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.400]   Number two is reframing.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.440]   Clark Howard, for years, has been telling me, "Get a Tesla.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.440]   It's so much fun."
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:51.640]   Eventually, the prices of Tesla got down into the 40s, but I couldn't buy it.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.800]   I said, "Clark, I love my Chevy Volt."
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:03.560]   What I did is I had to reframe it from a hedonistic to a utilitarian decision that I live in Colorado.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.520]   I will drive is important.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.560]   It's got more safety features, etc.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.800]   Then a third way, there are other ways, but I use our dysfunctional political system.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.920]   In other words, I tell the client that they have to spend a certain amount of money each
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.920]   year.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:28.280]   If they don't make it, they have to donate the rest of it to political candidates they
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.920]   hate the most.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.480]   They'll spend it.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:42.960]   In a similar vein, Mike published a new book earlier this year called More Than Enough,
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.400]   geared to people who have gotten to that point in their lives that they have enough financial
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.400]   resources.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:58.520]   Tell us about some of the key messaging that you want to share with that audience.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.920]   There's the spending topic, which we've been talking about all along, the different ways
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.880]   to get yourself to spend more, and then the giving side of it.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.480]   To me, that's the more exciting side.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:16.080]   If somebody is having a hard time spending, try giving.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.000]   Some people have a similarly challenging time giving, so start with something small if it
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.240]   makes you uncomfortable.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.720]   Every time, basically, it feels good, and then it's not so hard to do more.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.160]   This can be giving to your loved ones, of course, or giving to charity.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.540]   Giving to your loved ones, the message I always try to hammer home for people in this More
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:47.400]   Than Enough category is that just actuarially speaking, given the age at which most people
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:54.660]   have kids, by the time your kids inherit what's left of the portfolio, they're probably already
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:00.920]   retired or just about there, and so they get this big inheritance, and it might not really
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.140]   impact their lives.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:08.080]   It might not make their lives that much better at all, really, and so if that's a thing that
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.720]   you can do the math and you can look in your family and you can say, "Yeah, that might
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.140]   be where this is headed," then take a different path.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.120]   Start to make some gifts to them earlier.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.080]   Your gifts, even when they're smaller, are so impactful, so helping your grandkids, for
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:31.200]   instance, finish school without any student loans, the impact on them is enormous, not
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.920]   just in terms of their financial well-being, but their emotional well-being.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:41.120]   You were hearing that from Michelle's kids yesterday, that when they look at their peers,
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.900]   their peers are stressed about those student loans, and that is a burden that you could
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.460]   save your loved ones from, or the first home down payment.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.740]   Those are the two examples I always give, but there's other examples.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.840]   Pay for a trip with your family.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.880]   That is some of the best spending that people could ever do, because it's memories that
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:07.560]   they'll have with you, so spending on your family, or charitable giving, and there's
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:13.120]   all sorts of tax planning things that we can get into there, but that's kind of a whole
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.120]   other thing.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.880]   I was going to say, we always try to give people some low-barrier spending goals to
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:25.480]   get started, because it's very normal that it's hard for people to go from saving to
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.680]   spending, and so it might be hard to say, "It's okay for you to take a trip to Europe
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.160]   and bring the grandkids along."
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:39.640]   It might be easier for them to, say, plan a nice dinner out every month with their family,
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:47.080]   so you can try taking those low-barrier steps, and then work your way up from there as well.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.780]   Work your way up to the Tesla.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:59.320]   Coming back to people who don't have enough today, I'd like to talk about how you advise
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.200]   people to balance saving for multiple goals, like, for instance, for college and retirement.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:10.640]   What do you tell people, Aileen?
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.000]   The conventional wisdom is save for retirement, not for college, because there's loans for
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.520]   college and not for retirement, and that's why we have a trillion-plus dollars in outstanding
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.320]   student loan debt.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:28.400]   I do think when you have big goals, you need to save for both.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.800]   One of the ways I've found people are most successful saving is that rather than giving
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.320]   yourself a spending budget, give yourself a savings budget, because when you have a
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   savings budget and you hit that target, you feel successful.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:49.160]   When you have a spending budget and you hit that target, you feel deprived.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.960]   If you can set that budget for yourself and hit it, that's a great thing.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.680]   My rule of thumb for balancing the two is if you're not saving for retirement, don't
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.200]   save for college.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.640]   If you're saving for retirement but not maxing out, then only 10% of what you save for retirement
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.460]   should go to college or any other goal that you're trying to save for.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.760]   If you want to save more for other things, bump up your retirement savings rate in order
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.800]   to bump up those other savings rates as well.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.120]   Everything is available at every conceivable cost, including college.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.800]   You can go to college for $0.00.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   You can go to college for half a million dollars.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.920]   Just make sure that whatever that goal is besides retirement, you're creating pathways
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.600]   that are acceptable to you.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:39.960]   >> I'd like to ask you a question that came up earlier this morning in Mike's session,
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.640]   which was about education funding.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:49.200]   What would you tell people who were interested in ROTC or joining the military as a route
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.720]   to pay for education?
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.480]   >> My dad went to college on ROTC.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.840]   That was part of my upbringing and my life.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.440]   I think it's a great pathway for students to do.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:12.120]   Of course, there is the military service obligation once you graduate, but any way that someone
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:17.200]   else pays for your college tends to have some sort of obligation to it, whether it's a merit
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.680]   scholarship that you need to get a certain GPA, whether it's a student loan that you
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:27.320]   have to repay, whether it's ROTC where you have a service element to it.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.840]   I think one of the considerations with ROTC is what does the ROTC course load look like
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.600]   and does that leave you enough room in your schedule to pursue the major that you want
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.600]   to pursue?
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.280]   That would be, to me, kind of the one consideration about it.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.840]   >> One other thing we've talked about a lot over the last few days is how a lot of us
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:54.720]   accumulate a lot of complexity in our financial lives as the years go by and the value of
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:02.080]   trying to simplify, and so we've referred briefly in a few places to trying to simplify
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.520]   the number of accounts you have and the number of specific investments, and I wondered if
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.400]   the panel could just talk a little bit more about any specific advice you have in that
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:19.040]   area or other kinds of simplifying that we should be thinking about.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.840]   >> You know, I'm a hypocrite.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   For a living, I help people move towards simplicity, but my own portfolio is complex as heck.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:34.580]   New products come out, like the BlackRock tips funds, and, you know, I have to buy them
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.780]   to be able to write about them, the Intelligent Portfolio, lots of different things.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:45.880]   The tips ladder is complex to create, but it's simple once you've done it.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:51.720]   So certainly within the tax-deferred, tax-free account, you can get to simplicity, but you
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:57.400]   have to do a cost-benefit analysis on the taxable account on moving towards simplicity,
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.880]   but, yes, I wish my own portfolio were a lot simpler.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:06.040]   There weren't total stock funds out there when I started.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.740]   I think about that human energy, time, and attention is limited.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.720]   This is something that Paul Pant talks about a lot.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.560]   You can afford anything but not everything.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.480]   So even if you have all the money in the world, your time is still limited.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.880]   So going back to the list of really boring but really important financial planning projects
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.300]   that folks will have on their list, again, life insurance, disability insurance, umbrella
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.460]   insurance, long-term care insurance, doing your estate planning, creating an emergency
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.300]   letter, super boring but super important.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.840]   So if your time is limited, which it is, that's to say you can be here in this conference
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.140]   room right now, you can be on the phone with your insurance company right now buying umbrella
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:51.340]   insurance, or you can be creating an emergency letter right now, or you can do one of those
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.500]   things right now.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.900]   You can't do all three at the same time.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:00.500]   So if you keep your investment simple, it leaves you more time, more energy, more focus
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.220]   to do the much more important, albeit much more boring, other financial planning projects
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.500]   on your to-do list.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:14.020]   Last night Clark Howard had mentioned that one of his biggest concerns is scams as a
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:20.060]   risk to everyone, and I'm thinking, you know, scams come in every flavor, and then we have
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.860]   I.D. theft, and we have medical I.D. theft, and probably many things I've never even heard
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:25.860]   of.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:33.220]   So I'm wondering if there are any particular strategies that you recommend to help people
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.700]   stay safe or protect their money.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.660]   And John briefly mentioned the credit freezes, and, like, when do you recommend that?
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.420]   Who should do that?
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.860]   You want to do a credit freeze immediately, and you want to do it as early as possible
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.860]   for your kids.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.340]   I know it varies state by state insofar as how early you can do a credit freeze for your
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.580]   children, but you want to get that done as soon as possible.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.580]   Open your credit.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.580]   It's free.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.900]   It takes a few minutes.
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.900]   You do it online.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.780]   It's a really easy way to protect your credit, your family's credit.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.740]   But only if I'm not going to be taking out new debt of any kind, right?
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:13.500]   If you're opening up a new bank account, a new line of credit, absolutely.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.340]   The other thing that we always recommend is that you check your credit on an ongoing basis,
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.080]   and you can do that at annualcreditreport.com.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.880]   You're entitled to one free credit report from each credit bureau every year, so every
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.380]   four months you can get one of your credit reports.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.680]   And that shows you all of your credit activity.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.620]   It shows you what accounts are open, what accounts you've closed.
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.360]   If you're someone like me with a common last name, you will see lots and lots of interesting
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.120]   things there.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:47.880]   And that's your opportunity to identify these things early and get them dealt with.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.840]   Scams are everywhere, and they're getting worse.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.680]   And AI is going to make it even worse, I think.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.800]   You know, I'm 66 now.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.480]   I'm getting to the target age of these scams.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.180]   So, you know, I would just say make sure before you do anything, you're discussing it with
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.480]   another loved one.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.680]   Don't just send money in.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.740]   Anything that looks too good to be true, guess what?
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:15.160]   But yeah, it's getting harder and harder and worse and worse.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:20.760]   These scams are everywhere and proliferating.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:26.280]   There's also just some, you know, basic online safety practices, I guess.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.720]   Whenever you receive an email or a text or a phone call, really, from somebody saying
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.440]   they're from Bank of America or Vanguard or wherever you have assets or any other financial
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.280]   relationship, don't reply.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.000]   Don't click on their link.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.480]   Don't call them back.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.760]   Instead, you know, go to Bank of America's website and sign in, you know, through the
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.800]   way that you know is trusted, and then see if, you know, there is an alert there or whatever
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.440]   this thing was supposedly about.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.360]   Don't reply, because there's a huge chance that this isn't Bank of America contacting
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.360]   you.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.360]   Okay.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.760]   Yeah, the unfortunate truth is, as we get older, we're not as sharp as we used to be.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:10.040]   And that's why doing that estate planning, finding those trusted parties, that attorney
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.360]   in fact, that successor attorney in fact, the person you trust to manage your finances
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.720]   when you're not able to, is going to be a really important part of financial success
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.400]   in the future.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.800]   To share a little bit of a heartbreaking story, there's one person that I worked with.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.640]   Their parent, they had cognitive impairment.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.680]   The family wasn't quite aware of that yet, because they were hiding it quite well, which
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.120]   is something that folks with cognitive impairment do.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.160]   They get really good at hiding it, or even able to fool medical professionals.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:47.680]   I believe it's Cameron Huddleston talks about this in her book, "How to Talk to Your Parents"
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.560]   about their finances.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:55.680]   And this person, they were making political donations, forgetting they were making them,
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.680]   and then making them again.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.360]   And it was to the tune of five figures.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:06.760]   So again, putting together that power of attorney document, appointing the attorney in fact
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:12.120]   that you trust, bringing them into your finances sooner rather than later, that can help you
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.520]   set up yourself for success.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.160]   - Sounds good.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.560]   I think we're gonna go to some audience questions now.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.800]   First question.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:27.840]   What types of disability insurance do you feel are necessary for a working professional?
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.480]   Long term, short term, or both?
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.240]   - Generally both, is the short answer.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.000]   Lots of disabilities last longer than a short term policy will pay benefits.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.880]   So if you have a long career, or you're planning on a long career still, long term disability
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.180]   is generally what you need.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.200]   Social security is long term disability, but it's hard to qualify.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   The benefits are very limited.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.680]   So a long term policy is necessary.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:04.280]   - I would add to the long term disability, most employers provide long term disability.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:09.040]   If that's your only source of long term disability coverage, it's important to review that policy
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:16.400]   because employer long term disability is generally designed to cover illnesses as opposed to
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.040]   actual not being able to work for the remainder of your life.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.000]   So typically there's a limit to coverage.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.920]   They're assuming you might get a cancer diagnosis where you're going through chemo and radiation
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.600]   and unable to work for some finite period of time.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:37.440]   And it's possible that you could have a ski accident and be unable to work for much longer
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.320]   than your employer disability covers.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.160]   So just make sure that you review that policy if that's where you think your long term disability
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.160]   is coming from.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.120]   - Yeah, Anne's absolutely right.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.880]   Usually that workplace policy is not going to protect you in that worst case.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.040]   That worst case is you're disabled now through the rest of your life.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.480]   You're no longer able to work another day.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.160]   There's a lot of really fine print in a disability insurance contract.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.200]   That's going to determine if that policy is any good.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.080]   And again, the one that you get from your employer is not any good and the employer
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.320]   doesn't really want to spend $1,000 generally per employee in a high quality long term disability
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.800]   insurance policy, which means you've got to go out and purchase a high quality one yourself
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.240]   looking for that very important fine print in that contract.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.180]   So own occupation definition till age 65, that's an important clause.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:30.040]   Having an inflation adjustment, a COLA rider on that policy, that's going to be important.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.280]   Social disability provision, residual disability provision, these are all the really important
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.320]   bits of fine print that you want a high quality long term disability insurance policy to have.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.720]   Good news, we did a Bogleheads Live podcast episode on this, so check that out.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.520]   We go over all the fine print in that episode of what you want in your high quality long
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.760]   term disability insurance policy.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.760]   - Thank you.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.040]   - I'm just going to say long term.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.320]   You need both, but long term disability is far more devastating.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.560]   So you want to have that, but you also don't want to let inertia take over and you want
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.360]   to reduce it or cancel it when you no longer need it.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.040]   - Another insurance question.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:15.740]   Is there a rule of thumb to use in determining the right amount of umbrella liability coverage?
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:21.760]   For instance, should it cover 100% of my net worth or what amount is too much?
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.760]   - There's an old rule of thumb that says you should have your net worth in umbrella insurance
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.480]   and I've researched it as far as I can tell.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.840]   It was invented by an insurance salesperson.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.080]   You can have $100 million net worth, knock a school bus off a cliff, it gets sued for
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.440]   200 million.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.480]   So I just think you want to be reasonable.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.520]   If you drive fast sports cars, do extreme sports that could injure someone else, you
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.520]   probably need more.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:56.440]   You also want to look at how much of your net worth is in a risk of protected 401k sorts
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.560]   of thing.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.880]   So be reasonable.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.140]   Umbrella insurance, it's cheap.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:10.720]   It's cheap because the likelihood of needing it is low, but the consequences are very high.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.920]   - I'm always thinking about that worst case and so I certainly like the net worth rule
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.640]   of thumb, but for really young folks, that net worth rule of thumb doesn't really apply
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:25.960]   because their biggest asset, bless you, isn't what they're worth today, but it's their future
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.960]   earnings.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.720]   So think about someone who perhaps they're working at a tech company, they're earning
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   maybe $300,000 a year, but they're in their mid-20s, maybe early 30s.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.460]   They don't have a huge net worth, but they have millions of dollars of future income
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.460]   ahead of them.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.840]   So to be a little conservative, maybe get a little bit extra umbrella insurance.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.720]   It is very inexpensive for the coverage that it provides.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.800]   - Thank you.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.880]   - You can increase the umbrella over time, though.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.560]   - Here's a different kind of a question.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.760]   Do you think financial planners have some responsibility to encourage healthy living
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   for their clients, or is that discussion overstepping the bounds?
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:15.700]   After all, why plan for a long retirement if the client's lifestyle or habits would
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.540]   greatly shorten it?
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:23.580]   - I'm a financial advisor, not a life advisor.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.300]   And when you think of it, if you eat poorly, don't exercise, it's actually good for your
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:32.620]   financial plan because you're less likely to outlive your money.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:38.780]   There's no flaw in my logic, is there?
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.060]   We want our clients to live as long as their money, so some we should encourage to have
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:51.420]   healthy lifestyles, and some we should encourage to have an extra piece of cake at dinner.
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:56.100]   - What's your advice for a single person with no family to decumulate?
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.100]   How should they approach that?
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.660]   Decumulate, sorry if I didn't say that right.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:10.180]   - I don't think it's particularly different than for a married couple with kids and grandkids.
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.780]   We're still looking at the question of what asset allocation do we want to have through
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.220]   retirement, which accounts are we going to spend from.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:23.420]   Really the one thing that strikes me immediately is that there's one complicating factor that
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:28.580]   we don't have to worry about, which is for a married couple when we're trying to figure
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:35.580]   out what account to spend from, one of the factors is if we spend from tax deferred,
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.980]   what tax rate will we pay now, and how does that compare to the tax rate that we would
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:43.580]   pay later if the money comes out of the account later.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:50.620]   For a married couple, there's going to be a later period that includes only one of the
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.460]   spouses filing as single, which often means that there's going to be a period with higher
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.740]   tax rates later.
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.500]   That's just a thing we don't have to worry about for a single person.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:09.080]   Also for a single person, the question is who is the bequest going to?
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.980]   It's more likely in that case that if it's a single person without kids that it's going
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:19.060]   to a charity, which would mean that Roth conversions become a lot less advantageous during retirement
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:24.980]   because the "later tax rate" on a lot of these dollars is going to be 0% because the traditional
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.500]   IRA dollars are going to go to a charity, but that's not necessarily the case.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.660]   Obviously plenty of people who are unmarried and don't have kids aren't leaving the money
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.660]   to charity.
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.540]   They're leaving it to nieces and nephews or somebody else.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.260]   Thank you.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.260]   Question for Anne.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:50.860]   If you have your house paid for and you pay cash for cars, why do you need a credit score?
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.060]   Well, things could change.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:58.020]   You could decide you want that vacation house, and mortgage rates being as high as they are,
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:02.580]   you would want to get the best possible rate.
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.060]   I think life is unpredictable.
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:15.460]   We can think we're going down one path and we end up going down another.
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.300]   Why would you do things that wouldn't make things as easy as possible for you?
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:25.100]   Having a good credit score is something that makes things really easy for you.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:30.180]   The way you have a good credit score is you pay your bills on time.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:37.540]   Even if you're not using a credit card, most utility bills get reported to the credit bureaus.
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:41.660]   People with better credit scores don't pay deposits for certain services that people
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.180]   with bad credit scores do.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.620]   I think your credit score is something that benefits you over the course of your lifetime
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.660]   regardless of where you are with debt.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:56.220]   Can I just add insurance companies can charge more for people with lower credit scores because
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.020]   they have proven that claims are higher?
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.340]   There are other things, even if you're not utilizing that credit, such as, as you mentioned,
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:08.460]   the deposit, that keeping a high credit score is important.
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.780]   Sometimes an employer can also check your credit score as part of the job application
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.900]   process, so lots of benefits just keeping that score high.
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:20.380]   Here's an interesting question.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.340]   What have you changed your opinion about over time?
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:28.060]   We'll take that in the financial planning space, not your taste in music or whatever
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.060]   else.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.300]   Something you've changed your thinking on.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:39.460]   Certainly, not to talk about investing, but keeping the investments as simple as possible
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.620]   because, again, that's going to free you up to do those other much more important projects.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:49.140]   When putting together an investment plan, there's always the option to add complexity,
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.180]   but I think when adding that complexity, there can be a lot of uncertainty if there's really
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.860]   value in doing that.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:59.460]   Quote Jack Bogle, "When there are multiple solutions to a single problem, choose the simplest
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.460]   one."
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:04.540]   Yeah, I would second the vote for complexity.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:09.220]   I think that we as advisors tend to think people come to us wanting this really complicated
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.460]   stuff that they can't figure out on their own.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.140]   I think over time, I've realized people come to us because they want to live their best
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.220]   life now and in the future.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:22.700]   One of the things that we've added to our planning projects is at the end of every topic
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:30.540]   that we discuss, we show a matrix of the time versus money of the different strategies that
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.540]   we're recommending.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:36.700]   We talk our clients through which ones make the most sense for them to do because, yeah,
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:44.260]   you can do so many things to squeeze a little extra juice out of your dollar, but for many
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.500]   people that's not really necessary.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.900]   There are some people who just like action for action's sake, and they'll go and do all
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:58.460]   that stuff, but I think simplicity is something that I've come to cherish.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.860]   I've changed my view on safe spin rates.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.260]   I was very, very conservative.
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.820]   Christine just left, darn it.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:09.420]   I wrote a piece a little over a year ago why I disagree with Morningstar's new higher safe
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:16.860]   spin rates, and about a month ago I sent an apology to everyone that I'm wrong because
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:25.060]   what happened, our real interest rates went from minus 1.6 percent to 2.55 percent on
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.740]   those instruments that I'm not allowed to mention.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:37.180]   But by the way, ibonds.com and tipslider.com are just best places to get data for that
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:42.540]   thing I'm not allowed to mention.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:52.580]   This one maybe feels obvious, but early in my 20s, coming out of school, and soon thereafter
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:59.660]   was the financial crisis a few years after, and for me that was not scary at all.
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:09.620]   That was a buying spree, and it felt so obvious, and early in this era I just had this idea
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.340]   because my risk tolerance is very high.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.680]   It must be a mistake.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:20.500]   Anyone without a high risk tolerance must not get it, and it sounds so dumb to me now
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:25.940]   just having met more people and seen more people's life circumstances, but I sincerely
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:32.140]   believed that, that if you're not 100 percent stocks, you're just a wuss, and that's what
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.460]   everyone should be if they could do it.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.100]   And if you have a hard time doing it, maybe you just need somebody to talk you into doing
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:43.060]   it, and that's what's going to get the job done, and it's just not right.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:49.100]   I don't know, it sounds obvious again, but that's what I thought early on.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:55.180]   I'd like to hear you talk a little bit about how you think about home ownership in financial
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:40:00.500]   planning.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:06.220]   I don't consider it an investment, but the home is the one thing you can enjoy and generally
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:13.100]   goes up in value, so certainly if one's going to buy a home and stay there for a long time,
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.580]   I think it's a very good thing to do.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:21.860]   The one thing I do is when I look at safe spin rates, I don't include furniture or cars
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:27.900]   or things like that, but I do include a discounted value of the home, because later on, one could
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:36.900]   downsize, one could, in my opinion, last resort—sorry, Wade's not here—take out a reverse mortgage.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.740]   So I would count that as part of the safe spin rate.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:46.580]   Yeah, I would say there's—home ownership plays a different role at different points
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.580]   in your life.
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:52.500]   One of the great things for retirees is having a fixed housing cost, which home ownership
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:58.720]   provides in a way that renting doesn't, and like you said, your home is kind of your insurance
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.800]   policy.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.860]   It could cover long-term care, it could cover all kinds of things.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.380]   On the other hand, I don't think that we should be rushing young people to buy homes.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.220]   I keep hearing this from my family, I grew up in California, that's where my family
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.220]   all is.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.700]   My kids both have jobs in the Midwest, and my parents are like, "Oh, they'll be able
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.700]   to buy homes."
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.100]   And I was like, "No, no, back off."
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:24.820]   Not so fast on that, because there's an opportunity cost of home ownership, which is that you're
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:30.060]   giving up flexibility, you're giving up the opportunity to move for better opportunities.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.780]   So I think that home ownership is maybe something to start thinking about when you have young
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:41.360]   children and you want to be locked into a school district, and be at a point to start
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.700]   building equity.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.460]   But there doesn't need to be a rush to buy your first home.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:51.540]   Yeah, enthusiastically agree with that point.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:57.740]   Because people say rent is throwing away money, and okay, fine, but then property tax is throwing
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:02.140]   away money, and homeowners insurance being more expensive than renters.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.420]   There's things you're paying for when you own a home.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:11.660]   And the thing that I think often gets missed is that when people go from renting to owning,
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:16.100]   they don't just go from renting to owning, they also dramatically upgrade, almost every
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.100]   time.
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:22.340]   In my entire personal life, I can't think of a single person I know who, when they went
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:28.260]   from renting to the first home that they bought, every single one of them, it was bigger, it
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.740]   was nicer, it was in a nicer area, or whatever.
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:36.660]   And so the financial decision, then, is not just renting versus owning, it's and you've
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:41.860]   stepped up your quality of living, or whether that actually improves your quality of life
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:47.460]   is another thing, but the costs associated go up, and not just because of the renting
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.460]   versus owning shift.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:52.860]   Not to mention the to-do lists of things that go with that house.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.340]   Yeah, when you rent, things go wrong in multiples of $100, and when you own, they go wrong in
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.220]   multiples of $1,000.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:05.380]   Okay, I think we're going to wrap up here because we've run out of time.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.380]   Thank you for so many great questions.
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.380]   I want to thank our panelists.
