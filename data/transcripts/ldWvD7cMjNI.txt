[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   Okay, thanks, everyone.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.120]   We're about to get started.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.480]   I'm Christine Benz.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.720]   I am the president of the board of the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.920]   This is our closing session of the conference, and we wanted to end on something that's a
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.220]   little broader than these topics that we typically noodle on, and Bill Bernstein and Jonathan
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.840]   Clements I think set us up well for some of the topics that we'll be discussing in the
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.880]   course of this presentation.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.800]   I am so thrilled to introduce to my right Jordan Grumet.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:48.680]   He is a physician who is also a blogger and podcaster and has aligned himself with the
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.460]   FIRE community because he did achieve financial independence and has been pursuing some other
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.320]   interests since then.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.920]   Jordan's book came to all of you as conference attendees, and we wanted to make it available
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.240]   because I thought it was just a fabulous book, and in interviewing Jordan, I had kind of
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.940]   a pinch-me moment in that, you know, I'm like, "I get Morningstar to pay me for this kind
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.940]   of stuff.
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.680]   This is a pretty good thing I have going here."
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:28.620]   So Jordan has a lot of insights about his work with patients in hospice and what they
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.640]   have regrets about, sort of their moments of clarity about what they wish they had done
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.800]   differently in their life, and Jordan feels passionately about this idea that we need
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.620]   to think about this earlier in our lives, to think about what we want our lives to be.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.700]   So that's what I'm hoping we will discuss, or we will discuss during the course of this
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.700]   conversation.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.700]   Jordan, thank you so much for being here.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700]   Thank you so much.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.860]   It is a pleasure to be here, and I am humbled by the quality of both the participants and
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.300]   the speakers at this conference.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.580]   It's been truly exceptional.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.180]   Well, thanks, Jordan.
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.700]   And I wanted to mention Karen D'Amato is here.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.820]   She will be collecting your questions for Jordan, so we'll leave room for some questions
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.820]   at the end.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.900]   But Jordan, maybe we can start out by you sharing a little bit about your personal journey.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.020]   I mentioned that you were a physician, but at one point you sort of had a moment where
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.640]   you decided that you wanted to do something a little bit different.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.980]   So my life changed drastically when I was seven years old.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.360]   My father died suddenly.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.380]   He was a physician and an oncologist, which means he took care of cancer patients, and
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.740]   he had a Berry aneurysm, which is an aneurysm in the brain that bursts all of a sudden.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.180]   And so one day I had a father, and the next day I didn't.
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.380]   And being a seven-year-old kid, I looked at everything really through the lens of it's
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.900]   all about me.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.620]   So when my father died suddenly, I'm conscious of this now, I wasn't then, but I somehow
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.960]   felt like it was my fault, like I had done something wrong, or I wasn't good enough.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.700]   And so I struggled for months, even years, trying to figure out, well, what does this
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.320]   mean?
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.380]   And eventually I came to a conclusion.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.740]   I realized, or I thought, that I could psychically fix the problem of his death by becoming a
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.860]   physician like him, and walking in his footsteps, and doing the good deeds that he was doing.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.580]   And that notion carried me.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.540]   It created a sense of identity and purpose.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.420]   At the time, I had a learning disability, so I was way below my grade level for reading.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.380]   Everyone was passing me by.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.620]   But somehow the certainty that I would be a physician carried me through, and I got
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.220]   past learning disability, I went through high school and college.
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.740]   I would be the guy who was at the library on Saturday morning at the University of Michigan
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.900]   while everyone else was at the football game.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.300]   And I became a physician, and it filled me up somewhat.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.900]   It became very, very clear as the years went on that my vision of what being a physician
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.220]   was, a vision of the physician my father was, didn't fit me.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.200]   It wasn't rushing in and saving people's lives all the time.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.420]   It was also the paperwork, and the burnout, and the not sleeping.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.460]   And for me, realizing that this didn't feel like the purpose and identity that I thought
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.740]   it would, and I started searching for a way out.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.020]   And I went to my accountant, and I asked my accountant, well, how much money do I need
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.540]   to retire, because if I can retire I can leave this thing that isn't filling me up anymore.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.180]   And she said $10 million.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.380]   Didn't tell me why, didn't give me any reasoning, but I didn't have $10 million.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.780]   So then I went to my financial advisor, and he did all sorts of simulations, and he didn't
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.740]   ask me how much I wanted to spend every year.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.020]   And when we finally started talking about it, I had never tracked my expenses.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.300]   So he said, how much do you want to spend every year?
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.940]   I said $300,000.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.300]   I had no idea how much money I was spending.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.060]   And so he did the calculations and came up with a number close to $10 million, and of
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.360]   course I wasn't there, so I couldn't retire.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   And then something amazing happened.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.540]   I was writing a blog about medicine.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.300]   I had been writing about what it felt like to be a doctor, and in 2014, a person sitting
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.300]   in this audience called me and asked me to review his book, and that's Jim Dolley.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.380]   And I have to tell you, I give Jim Dolley a lot of credit for where I am today, but
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.020]   up to this point, I've also made the mistake of not including his wife, Katie Dolley, who
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:48.860]   actually is a big part of the White Coat Investor platform, so I should be thanking her also.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.340]   But I got his book, and I read through it in like one sitting.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.980]   I mean, it took about three, four hours.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.060]   I was so engrossed.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.500]   And I realized that I was financially independent.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.620]   His book gave me the vocabulary that my financial advisor and my accountant didn't.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.220]   He helped me see a little bit of what enough truly looks like, at least when it comes to
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.600]   enough money, and I was elated.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.880]   I could leave this job that was no longer fulfilling me.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.740]   I could live the life I wanted to live, and then I had a panic attack, literally that
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.660]   same day, because I had no idea what the life I wanted to live was.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.060]   The only sense of purpose and identity I ever had outside of family and getting married
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.900]   and having kids, the stuff we all have, but all I knew was being a doctor, and to let
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.900]   go of that was to step away from my identity, even if it wasn't fulfilling me, and to also
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.300]   step away from the little wisp of connection I had with my father.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.160]   So instead of throwing the baby out with the bathwater and just stepping away from medicine,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.520]   I was way too afraid to do that.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.740]   I did what I always do when I face difficult things in life.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.740]   I started writing.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.460]   In this case, I started a financial blog because personal finance and fire and all that stuff
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.580]   is what I was enthralled with, and that eventually turned into a podcast.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.300]   And when it comes to personal finance, I didn't want to talk about the how, and the reason
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.340]   why is we have so many people in attendance here who are better than that than me.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.300]   I wanted to talk a little bit about something different.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.580]   I wanted to talk about the why and what's next.
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.060]   So you now have a plan for making money, and that money will sustain you.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.700]   How does that relate to happiness?
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.820]   How does that relate to purpose?
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.700]   What do you want to do with all this power you've gained?
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.700]   And so I had all these experts on my podcast, these entrepreneurs, these fire practitioners,
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.820]   these educators, and I found that they had some of the answers, but I found their answers
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.640]   were lacking.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.120]   In the meantime, professionally, I'd realized that being a physician wasn't fulfilling me,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.500]   so I started doing what I call the art of subtraction.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.340]   I got rid of all those things that weren't fitting me because I had enough money.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.060]   So I got rid of nights and weekends, and I eventually jettisoned my private practice.
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.300]   The one thing I kept was I loved to do hospice medicine, taking care of the terminally ill
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.620]   and dying.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.700]   I would do that even if people weren't paying me to do it, and so I knew that was a part
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.860]   of my purpose.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.540]   So it was something worth holding on to, but I could do that in such a way that I only
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.620]   spent 10 or 15 hours a week doing that, so what would I fill the rest of my time with?
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:26.420]   At this point, it was a podcast and a blog, but all those big questions that I was having
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:32.100]   with my podcast guests, all those huge conversations, I was finding the answers in a very unique
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.260]   place.
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.540]   I was finding them at the bedside with my dying patients.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:43.580]   You see, when you're being told that you have weeks or months to live, it changes the lens
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.780]   in which you look at life.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:51.900]   You are able to let go of all of those societal expectations and family expectations.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:09:01.860]   For the first time in life, it gives you permission to ask, "What's really meaningful to me?"
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.680]   And that's what my patients were doing, and I had this epiphany.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.340]   What if we didn't have to wait until we were dying to start thinking about these things?
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.620]   What if we could start thinking about these things in the young and the healthy, all these
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.820]   people who are listening to my podcast, who are trying to figure out what to do with their
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.780]   money and how to live a purposeful life?
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.460]   The dying had some of these answers, and that became the book, Taking Stock.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.980]   Yeah, thanks, Jordan.
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.820]   That was a super helpful encapsulation.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.580]   I want to go back to you talking about how being a physician was such a big part of your
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.220]   personal identity, and I think that's the case for a lot of us as we go through our
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.460]   careers.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.860]   It becomes part of our identity, and that's very hard to step away from, whether you're
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.940]   making kind of a career pivot.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.880]   Maybe you don't love some aspects of what you do, or maybe you're retiring, which requires
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.340]   you to step away from that work identity entirely.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.480]   Can you talk about that?
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.620]   Because I think a lot of people are navigating that sense of purpose and identity that they
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.540]   get from work.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.420]   How do you make changes to that?
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.460]   Well, here's the interesting thing.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:17.140]   If that purpose and identity from work or whatever you're doing is filling you, you
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.140]   tend not to walk away from it.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.660]   Jack Bogle, did he stop wanting to come to Bogleheads conferences?
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.140]   No, right?
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.900]   He was going to do that until he literally couldn't anymore.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.280]   The reason why we have trouble is because many of us are realizing that that purpose
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.900]   and identity is no longer serving us.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.000]   Let's say you're getting close to retirement or you're like, "I have enough money."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.900]   If this thing you were doing was really filling you, you wouldn't even think about leaving
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.280]   it.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.200]   But if you are thinking about leaving it, it means that maybe it's time to consider
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.600]   a pivot in your sense of purpose and identity.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.540]   Maybe what was serving you before is not serving you now.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:03.120]   The question is, will you have the courage to do that deeply difficult work of asking
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.240]   yourself, "Well, if I'm not this job anymore, if I'm not the thing that people recognize
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:15.280]   me for because it's not feeling good, what am I then?"
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.280]   And that's the question is, are you ready to start working on those things?
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:26.900]   Are you ready to pivot because your psyche is telling you that you should, right?
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:32.820]   If you're finding that you've had enough of work or you've had enough of doing this thing,
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:38.820]   then you probably have to start asking, "Well, what comes next and what part of myself am
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.380]   I not addressing?"
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:47.260]   I wanted to follow up on the conversation that Bill and Jonathan had where they were
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.700]   talking about happiness set point.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.480]   And I mentioned to Jordan that was a new term to me, but I am familiar with the hedonic
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.820]   treadmill, and it sounds like there's a relationship.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.180]   So maybe you can talk us through that.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.220]   So happiness set point is key to the idea of the hedonic treadmill or hedonic adaption.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.720]   This idea that we have a set point of happiness, and we scuttle around and try to increase
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.500]   that by either buying things or maybe achievements and job titles.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.320]   Or in my book, "Taking Stock," I talk about some of us actually try to increase happiness
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.700]   by saving a lot and getting a high net worth, and I call that overdrive in the book.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:30.580]   But the point of it is we tend to get to that place, and then we adapt back to our baseline
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.060]   or we habituate.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:37.020]   So it is very common for us to return to our baseline.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.540]   Some of that is human nature.
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.480]   But I think when it comes to things like money, part of it is that we tend to make things
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.220]   like money a goal instead of a tool.
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.420]   And the reason that they don't fulfill us is when we get to that higher net worth or
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.580]   we make more money, we think it's going to fill us up, but it doesn't because money's
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.060]   a tool, and we want to use that tool to do the more important things.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.820]   So if you don't have any idea of what your purpose and identity are, you don't know what
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.220]   those more important things are.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.740]   So you get to that higher net worth, and you ask yourself a question.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.220]   You say, "Well, what now?"
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.820]   And you're really happy for a moment, a week, or a month, but eventually you fall back to
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.460]   that set point, and you have to ask yourself, "Well, what comes next?"
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.340]   Now, I think the mistake a lot of us make is instead of doing the hard work of thinking
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.300]   about purpose and identity and what fills me up, we instead just double down.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.860]   And we say, "Well, a million dollars was my net worth, and I got there, and I'm not feeling
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.180]   great anymore, so let's set a new goal of two million."
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.180]   I think that happens.
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.540]   Or the opposite happens.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.980]   We get to a million dollars, and we were hoping upon hope we'd get to that net worth, and
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.620]   then we become petrified we're going to lose it.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.820]   And that's loss aversion, right?
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.060]   The market's going to go down the next day, and all of a sudden we had a net worth of
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.540]   a million dollars, but now it's only $999,000.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:01.460]   And some of us become so afraid of losing what we gained, it's actually doubly as painful.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:06.160]   But all of this focuses on the point that things like money or even achievements are
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.400]   not particularly good goals.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.440]   Money is a great tool.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:17.780]   So I challenge all of you, you've been so wise and savvy about your money.
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.480]   Most of you here will die with far too much money.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.080]   It's just, it's going to happen, statistically, we know this.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:30.200]   The question is, did that money serve you to do the deeper, more important things in
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.360]   your life?
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.080]   So you have argued that one of the reasons that we tend to focus so much on money and
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.360]   our financial wherewithal is that it's something we can actually measure, whereas the other
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.720]   stuff you're talking about, it's like, oh, I can't measure that.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.560]   So it's a little harder to latch on to.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.560]   Can you expand on that?
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.680]   Yeah, I mean, money is the low hanging fruit.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.160]   It is measurable.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.680]   We can define it.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:02.040]   We can decide I need to make more money, I can save more, I can get a more aggressive
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.560]   job, I can get a promotion.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:10.320]   It may not be easy to become financially independent or get a high net worth, but we definitely
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.160]   know what the right steps are.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.440]   And because of that, it's comfortable.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.320]   But I think it creates a certain amount of mirage, it confuses us and makes us think
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.000]   that that's the most important thing.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.400]   And it's an easy trap to fall into.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.360]   The harder trap is to say, what kind of person do I want to be?
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.240]   And what's purposeful in my life?
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.240]   To figure that out takes a lot more brainpower, a lot more time, and the answers are not nearly
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.720]   as finite, they're ephemeral, and we are very uncomfortable with that.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:47.040]   And I think even though it seems almost a touch distant, I think we're also afraid
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.920]   of dying.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.480]   To look at your life and start thinking about those ephemeral things like purpose and identity
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.480]   is to recognize that life is finite, and if you don't start working on it now, one day
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.080]   it will be too late.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.240]   We don't like to do that.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:09.200]   It is much easier to focus on something not nearly as important, like our personal finances,
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.840]   our net worth.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.720]   And so we reach for the low hanging fruit because it's comfortable.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.700]   But what I always tell people like you is when a guy like me, a hospice doctor walks
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.640]   into your room and gives you that prognosis of six months or less, you're not going to
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.240]   be thinking about your net worth.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.900]   You are not going to be thinking about whether you worked more nights or weekends.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.280]   You're not going to be thinking about whether you made it to partner or not.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.520]   And God forbid, I hate to say this, you're not going to be thinking about whether you
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:45.240]   did that 30-year tips ladder.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.000]   But you will.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.680]   You will be thinking about those things that you regret that you never had the energy,
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.600]   courage, or time to do.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:03.080]   And my guess is, as I said, 90% of you here will die with more money than you'd ever need.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:08.680]   But I'm going to also guess that probably 90% of you will also die with regrets.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.880]   And yet we spend so much time talking about our money and so little time talking about
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.480]   purpose.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.560]   Why is that?
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.880]   So let's dive into that, Jordan.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:27.800]   You have spent a lot of time with hospice patients, and you've heard their regrets.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.080]   Say you've also heard some fabulous insights from some of these people.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.380]   So let's talk about some of the key things you've learned from people who are in their
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.720]   last days or months.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.440]   So to say what are the most common regrets of the dying, we can't have this conversation
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.440]   without talking about Bronnie Ware, who was a palliative care nurse who wrote a book called
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.840]   The Five Regrets of the Dying.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.680]   Basically she gives five things that people tend to regret, and they're not specific things.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.360]   It's more generalizations.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.400]   But the way I'd summarize it is we regret that we never had the energy, courage, or
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.320]   time to do those things that were important to us.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.600]   And guess what?
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.400]   That's different for every person.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.240]   Like for me, one of the big things for me was traditionally publishing a book, and I'd
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.960]   put it off forever and ever and ever.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.580]   And God forbid I'd gotten terminally ill before I'd done this.
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.160]   That would have been one of my regrets.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.840]   But for you, it might be something else.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.440]   It might be building that business or pursuing that hobby or whatever it is that's important
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.440]   to you.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.440]   It might have to do with relationships.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.260]   It might be fixing that relationship that went awry.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:37.680]   So for each of us, it's different, but most of us have something in our past that we'd
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.140]   like a do-over.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.560]   We have something that we regret.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.280]   And guess what?
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.680]   We call it regret when you're dying because most likely we don't have the agency to fix
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.680]   it.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:54.820]   What do we call regret in a young person who has tons of life left?
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.480]   We call it purpose.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.600]   I call it the fodder for something I call the climb, which is purpose in action.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:07.680]   But it is an anchor to start deciding what kind of life we want to live today.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.320]   So the dying very much taught me that.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:15.160]   And one other thing I think is really important to mention is the dying also taught me that
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:21.180]   it wasn't the success or failure of that important thing.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.440]   It was being in the arena and fighting the valiant fight.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.600]   So in my book, I talk about a patient of mine.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.600]   This is not his real name.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.420]   The story's been changed slightly, but his name was Ernesto.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:35.160]   And he was in his 20s, and he did something that everyone around him couldn't understand.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.640]   He left his high-flying corporate job for a year to train and then to go climb Mount
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.640]   Everest.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.280]   And everyone told him that he was getting out at the wrong time, and he was a rising
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.360]   corporate star, and if he left now, he would miss out on all these chances, and he would
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.800]   never make it up again.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.720]   But this was deeply important to him.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.720]   So Ernesto went.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.320]   He left work at the age of 25.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.620]   He trained and trained and trained.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.620]   He went to climb Mount Everest.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.800]   He made it about halfway up.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.920]   The weather changed, and they had to come back down.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:07.760]   I met Ernesto in his 40s when he was dying of leukemia, and all he could talk about was
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.280]   being up on Mount Everest.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.800]   Those were the stories he regaled all the hospice nurses with.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.160]   He didn't regret that he didn't succeed, but he would have deeply regretted if he had never
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.840]   tried.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.520]   So a lot of people use the excuse that I don't want to go do this thing because I'm going
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.640]   to fall on my face, and boy, how horrible I'll feel then.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.920]   I can tell you the dying don't regret what they failed at but tried deeply.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.920]   They regret what they never had the courage to try.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.080]   So keep that in mind.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.680]   You already win the game if you go out and start pursuing these things.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.160]   It actually doesn't matter the outcome.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.840]   So one other thing that you said to me, we were talking about this at one point, and
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:58.720]   you mentioned that it doesn't have to be writing a book or trying to climb Mount Everest.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.760]   There can be smaller things that we should tackle and pursue.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.800]   It doesn't have to be that bucket list, super aspirational item.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   Can you talk about that?
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   Sure.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.000]   And I think we have to talk about the nature of purpose, and admittedly, this is a little
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.240]   bit controversial, but the feedback I got from my book, Taking Stock, after giving several
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.960]   talks and going to all sorts of conferences is people said, "Look, your book talks about
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.240]   purpose, identity, and connections.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.320]   I've been trying to find my purpose, and it's making me anxious, and in fact, I've given
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.320]   up on purpose.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.440]   Why do people keep telling me to find my purpose?"
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.240]   And it really made me go to the literature and think, well, how important is this idea
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.660]   of finding purpose in our life?
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.480]   And the literature shows us that it's actually pretty darn important.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.800]   People who have a sense of purpose in life live longer, are healthier, and tend to be
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   happier.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.180]   On the other hand, I did more research and found that people, also 90% of us at some
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.120]   point in our life, have what's called purpose anxiety.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:00.640]   This idea of purpose is so big and scary, it actually makes us feel worse and not better.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:06.680]   So what we have here is a paradox, what I call the purpose paradox.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.280]   And I think fundamentally why it can be the most important thing in your life, as well
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.960]   as the most anxiety-provoking, is we've done a horrible job of understanding purpose in
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.960]   our life.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.960]   It's not just one thing.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.360]   In my opinion, it's two things, and specifically, and here's where the controversy comes, I
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.000]   think one of them is good and one of them is bad.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.680]   The bad type of purpose, believe it or not, is what I call big P-purpose, or the big audacious
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.520]   purpose like I want to change the world, I want to make a million dollars, I want to
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.180]   cure cancer.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.720]   Why are these things bad?
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.000]   Ultimately, I have nothing wrong with the idea of having big goals, but a lot of times
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.940]   we don't have as much agency.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.320]   No matter how hard you try, you probably will not become a billionaire.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.600]   You probably will not cure cancer.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.880]   So if you are setting your sense of purpose on these big, audacious goals that you have
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.340]   very little control over, you have to be the right person at the right time with the right
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.920]   knowledge and have a lot of luck, if you are going to base your sense of purpose and happiness
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.800]   on that, you're probably going to get a lot of purpose anxiety because you're probably
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.880]   never going to get there.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.760]   But what if we change things around?
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.080]   What if instead of big, audacious purpose, we start looking at what I call little P-purpose,
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.200]   this idea that purpose actually is just doing something that's deeply meaningful and important
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.960]   to you and doesn't have to be goal-oriented.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.820]   Instead what if we made purpose about doing the things that we enjoy doing in the moment
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.080]   and we don't care the outcome?
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.520]   If you change the way you start looking at purpose and look at it in that manner, then
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:39.820]   instead of being scarce the way big, audacious purpose is, only so many people are going
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:44.480]   to win the Nobel Prize or cure cancer, cure even one cancer.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.280]   It becomes abundant.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.600]   Think about all the million things we could find to do that fill us up and that we enjoy
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.360]   doing in the moment.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.120]   And so I think we fundamentally have to look at purpose different.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.620]   And I'll tell you, when I say this to people, they look at me and say, "Well, what about
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.620]   impact?"
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.600]   And certainly we can talk about impact if you want, but my belief is that you actually
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.680]   impact more people when you pursue what I call little P-purpose than you do when you
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.080]   pursue big, audacious purpose.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.260]   I wanted to ask about some of the exercises in the book.
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:22.020]   You have some very tangible things that you can go through to help arrive at conclusions
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:29.280]   about your own purpose, small P or big P. But let's talk about the life review, what
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:34.300]   that means and how someone would go about doing it.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:40.360]   So I think the life review is like the greatest answer to how do I find my purpose.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.080]   So what a life review is, is a structured series of questions that often in hospice
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.280]   and palliative care, we go through with our hospice patients.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.120]   So the first thing we make sure is that their pain is controlled, their nausea is controlled,
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.800]   and they're in a safe place, and hopefully they're dying where they want to die, whether
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.100]   that's at home or in the hospital or at a nursing home.
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.640]   But then a doctor or a nurse or a chaplain or social worker can sit down with them and
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.180]   go through a series of structured questions that helps them come to terms with their life.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.320]   So it's, you know, what were those most important moments in your life?
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.400]   What were your biggest successes?
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.980]   What were your biggest failures?
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.300]   Who were those key relationships?
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.960]   What did you fail to accomplish?
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.280]   What are you most proud of accomplishing?
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.240]   What would you like to accomplish in whatever time you have left?
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.800]   And so by doing this, it's a really good inventory of our lives, and it might be the first time
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.920]   that someone actually systematically looks at their life and starts asking those questions.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:39.600]   What was important to me, and now that I'm dying, what do I regret not having the time
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.900]   to do?
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.060]   And so again, this is the idea of the life review.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:49.160]   You can go to Google and search "hospice life review" and find some very detailed questionnaires,
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.480]   but the one-second life review comes back to that most basic question.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.160]   If I found out that I was going to die in the next six months, what would I regret never
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.480]   having the energy, courage, or time to do?
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.360]   And this is the place where you start to anchor your search for purpose.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.240]   And I want to be clear here.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:13.280]   I think we search for anchors of purpose, but we don't find purpose, we create purpose.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.800]   So it's a very active pursuit, but most of us can look back at our lives and start thinking
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.000]   about what some of those anchors are.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.360]   So the dying are very clear because they start thinking about, "Boy, I really wish I did
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.760]   X or pursued Y."
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.520]   I encourage all of you now to do the same thing.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.260]   What are some of those anchors, those things that were important to you?
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.840]   A life review is one way to do it.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.520]   There are several other exercises you can do to start working on them, but what are
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:45.640]   some of those anchors that you can then actively build a life of purpose around?
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.300]   Because ultimately, you're going to have to create purpose.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.300]   You don't find it.
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.520]   You certainly don't find it on Instagram.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.920]   That's basically trying to take someone else's sense of purpose and make it your own, and
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.200]   that almost never makes us happy.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:05.720]   To follow up on that, I do think that the Instagram culture is contributing to this
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.420]   sort of live for today type mentality.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.420]   Can you talk about that?
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:17.120]   How social media and trying to put out a certain persona for the public can influence some
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.760]   of the things that people do that maybe don't contribute to their personal well-being?
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:29.400]   I think we have a lot of societal ideas of what purpose should look like.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.640]   I hate to say it, but it's really been sold to us.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.320]   Look at the marketing industry.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.600]   Look at the ad industry.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.280]   That was before, and now look at the social media influencer industry.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:46.520]   Basically, someone is trying to sell to you what purpose is, most likely to put money
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.920]   in their own pockets.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.720]   All of these images that are bombarding us of people working out and wearing fabulous
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:28:01.200]   clothes and going to fabulous places sounds great, and if you are searching for purpose,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.080]   it's really easy to co-opt someone else's sense of purpose and try to make it your own.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:12.000]   The problem is, unless those things deeply speak to you, you may spend money on that
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.040]   course or take that expensive vacation, but it may not really fill you up.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.560]   Big part of finding purpose is to let go of everyone else's purpose and to start looking
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:28.080]   inward at what lights you up, because for everyone, that can be slightly different.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:35.280]   Two of us can both be lit up by the same thing, but for all the people in this room, each
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.780]   of us might have something different.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:41.720]   My wife likes to buy coach purses on eBay.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.340]   This is not going where you think it is.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.380]   There's a problem, though.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:52.580]   When you buy a coach purse on eBay, it could be a fake, so guess what?
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.600]   There's this guy who you can take.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.880]   When they put the purse on eBay, they take a picture of it, and a lot of times there's
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.440]   some numbers on the tag, and they take a picture of that.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.300]   There's a guy who, for free, you can send him those pictures, and he will authenticate
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.920]   it online for you, and then you can go buy it and know that it's authentic, and the guy
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.560]   doesn't charge a thing.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.560]   You know why?
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.180]   Because the guy worked for coach for 30 years, loves the company, and loved what he did.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.300]   That is purpose, and there's not a single other person in this room that's going to
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:28.380]   have that purpose, but that must light this guy up, right?
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.980]   You can't get that stuff off of Instagram.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.880]   You can't learn about that kind of thing on Facebook.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:41.460]   We are very unique individuals, and for one person, it might be collecting special, you
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.500]   know, rare metals.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.280]   For another person, it might be writing books.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.140]   For another person, it might be teaching people about finance.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.500]   I don't want you to think you're here and it's not bringing purpose.
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:58.380]   For many of you out there, teaching finance or learning to help people with their money
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.660]   or teaching in general might be a big part of your purpose, so it's not like we're being
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:08.740]   frivolous by being here, but be brave enough to ask yourself what really matters to you,
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.260]   not what society tells you, not what Instagram tells you, but what really lights you up.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.580]   When are you your best self, and what are you doing at that time?
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:22.220]   Jordan, maybe you can talk about your own path while you were still a physician, trying
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:26.980]   to figure out what was your purpose.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.600]   What about what you're doing now really lit you up?
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.100]   Maybe you can talk about that sort of journey.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:39.620]   So I'm 50 years old, and I finally have come to terms with my purpose, and the reason why
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.620]   is I Googled my name, and it said, you know, Google put some descriptive information, and
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:48.540]   the first thing that came up was "writer," and it filled my heart with joy at the age
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:57.380]   of 50 seeing this, and the reason why is I finally felt seen by Google a search engine.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.760]   What does this mean?
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.740]   There was always a writer in me, there was always a communicator, but I had submerged
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:08.960]   that sense of purpose and identity, A, because my father died and I felt like I had to cosmically
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.540]   fix that, but B, because somewhere deep down inside I told myself that I could never succeed
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.180]   or that wasn't a profession.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.620]   See, being a doctor is a profession, and you can do that, and you can make a lot of money,
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:26.200]   and you can get awards and accolades, but I never saw a path as a writer or a communicator.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.860]   That was something I did in my free time.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.380]   That was a hobby, and so I pursued it as a hobby.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:35.900]   I spent all my time being a doctor, and I would fit writing a blog into that, you know,
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.380]   30 minutes at lunchtime when I was grabbing something to eat, or I'd wait till the kids
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.220]   went to bed, and I was yawning because I hadn't slept in 30 hours, but yet I was scrolling
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.340]   down that blog post without editing it and hearing the next day about how many grammatical
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:53.900]   errors I made by the public who was then commenting on it, because I didn't have time or energy.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:59.080]   I pushed these essential, important things away because I somehow convinced myself that
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.860]   they weren't good enough to be purpose.
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:06.980]   I had to become financially independent to finally give myself permission, and even then
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:15.400]   it was difficult to be the person who Google has clearly told me I should be.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.540]   But what I'm realizing is maybe younger people don't need to do that.
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.660]   Maybe it's not all black and white, but there's shades of gray.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:27.100]   Maybe we can do jobs that we don't love to make money and yet still build in a sense
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.840]   of purpose into our lives.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:34.220]   The lucky ones of us might be able to find a job that also lights us up and builds purpose,
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.220]   but I'm not Pollyanna.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.140]   I don't think it needs to be.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:42.100]   But think about how much better off we would all be if we could start building our financial
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:47.780]   future, having an idea of what purpose looks like, and then incorporate it, realizing what
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:53.460]   the tradeoffs are, realizing what working those extra nights and weekends means, and
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.780]   then deciding whether it's worthwhile or not.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.900]   The truth of the matter is we've mostly been doing this blind.
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:05.620]   We've convinced ourselves that some monetary goal is what should drive us, and we haven't
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:06.620]   looked past it.
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.060]   We haven't seen past the mirage.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.220]   And so I had to give myself permission to see past the mirage, but the only way I could
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.140]   personally do it is I had to have tons of money.
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.420]   What I'm trying to convince younger people now is that we should actually look at purpose
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:27.060]   first and then build a financial framework around it.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.580]   >> We're receiving some questions.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.700]   Here's a good one.
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:34.220]   What are some of the common or specific regrets you've heard from your hospice patients?
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.140]   >> Oh, my God, I mean, they're various.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:42.060]   I mean, they tend to focus on I never did that thing that was important to me.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:47.380]   I never fixed that relationship that was broken.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.540]   I didn't spend enough time doing things that were important to me.
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.760]   It's much easier to say what they don't regret.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.140]   They don't regret not working more.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.140]   They don't regret not having more money.
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.140]   They don't regret not having enough things.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.060]   I mean, it is true.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:08.940]   Sometimes I walk into a patient's room, someone who's on hospice, and they are surrounded
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.780]   by material things, but it's almost never those material things themselves that are
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.820]   important.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.460]   It's the meaning behind them.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.820]   It's the memories that they evoke.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:23.920]   It's that these things happen to be an outer extension of who they are on the inside.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:29.500]   And so, again, the number of regrets are as varied as the number of people.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.700]   What I find more interesting is what people don't regret.
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:39.620]   What do hospice patients say about their spiritual goals or their faith goals?
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:45.220]   Again, that's incredibly varied, and it depends on the purpose.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:50.600]   If religion and spirituality are important to you, make that part of your purpose.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:57.140]   Engage in things which connect you to that religion or to that feeling of spirituality.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.820]   I don't know if I said this clear enough in the book.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:05.140]   Winning the game is not about getting to financial independence, and it's not about purpose,
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.260]   and it's not about identity.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.280]   It's actually about connections and community.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:15.180]   And almost everything we do ends up in service of that.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.740]   So especially in the book, I talk a lot about how we find our sense of purpose.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.180]   I talk a lot about how we think about identity.
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:26.820]   I talk a lot less about connections, and the reason why is connections and community naturally
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.440]   flow from the first two.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.740]   When you start doing things that deeply interest you, and you get a better hold of who you
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:39.940]   are as a person, whether you mean to or not, you are going to create communities.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.420]   And again, I would go back to Jack Bogle.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.820]   Jack Bogle was doing something deeply, deeply purposeful to him.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:53.580]   He wasn't doing it necessarily probably to create a community, but he created that community
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:59.680]   nonetheless, because we are drawn to people who are intentional and authentic about doing
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.580]   things that light them up.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:06.660]   We all know people like this in our world, and we want to be around them.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.240]   And if you can find someone who has something that lights them up that is similar to something
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:16.480]   that lights you up, that connection will be stronger and more enduring, and you will change
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.360]   that person, and that person will change you more.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.640]   And if you multiply that by tens or thousands, you find, and this comes back to this idea
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.240]   of impact, the difference between big P purpose and little P purpose, if you pursue your little
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:35.200]   P purpose and find what lights you up, you will impact the people around you, who will
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.480]   impact the people around them, who will impact the people around them, and a hundred years
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.320]   from now, there will be thousands of people who are touched by your life, and they won't
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.080]   even know your name.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:52.480]   Let's talk about parents and how they should think about this when they're talking to their
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.640]   children as their children are kind of picking a career path, or maybe they have picked a
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:02.180]   career path, how they should counsel their children to help, you know, find the right
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.180]   purpose.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:09.240]   I was inspired listening to Michelle and Kevin yesterday talk about how they really looked
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.480]   at their kids and looked at what lit them up and urged them to pursue those career paths
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.620]   regardless of the remuneration that might be associated with them.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:19.620]   Talk about that.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:25.120]   Let me parrot a little bit about what I think Michelle and Kevin said.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:30.560]   If you find your purpose, that's the hard thing, you'll find a way to make the money.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.880]   There are countless ways to make money, there are countless ways to maximize a purposeful
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.040]   job, and there are countless ways to side hustle.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.560]   The purpose is actually the hardest part of the equation, and again, I'm not Pollyanna
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.560]   about it.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.880]   It's fine to say, "Look, I think I'm going to live a long life, and I can go into engineering,
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.960]   and I can work really hard for 10 years, and that's going to create enough money that I
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.640]   can then pull back from engineering and do something that's more purposeful for me."
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:03.040]   And if you are aware of that and thoughtful about it and authentic about it, I think that's
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.120]   a reasonable tradeoff to make, as long as you know that it's a tradeoff.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.440]   Other people will say, "You know what?
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.080]   Life is short, I could die tomorrow like my father did, and I'm going to do something
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.120]   I love today, and maybe there are financial consequences.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:22.680]   Maybe I may not be able to retire until 65 or 70, but I'm going to enjoy every moment
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.720]   of the life I'm living now."
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.880]   These are all choices, and none of them are bad.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:34.440]   What's bad is going through life with blinders on your eyes and not even thinking about it.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:39.960]   Have you encountered patients where that was a regret, where they felt like they were in
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.720]   that mode where they were just trying to maximize their earnings while they were young, and
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:50.200]   they just worked so hard at the expense of everything else they might have considered
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   important?
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:56.720]   I mean, I tell a story in the book, and I refer to the person as the patriarch, but
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:03.680]   this was a gentleman who had a multibillion-dollar industry that he had created and had enough
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:09.320]   money to buy the hospital wing in which he died in, but his heirs were all busy fighting
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.820]   over his money and basically were just kind of counting the time until he died so they
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.100]   could move on.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:19.200]   And I remember very clearly him having a sense of, "I did this all wrong because I'm sitting
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.720]   in a hospital room alone.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:27.720]   Yes, my family members are doing the perfunctory visiting, et cetera, but they were more interested
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.560]   in the board meeting and who is going to end up taking over the company."
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:37.320]   And we often talk about Maslow's Pyramid, right, this idea that self-actualization is
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.940]   at the top and our economic needs are at the bottom, but I think we look at it all wrong.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.800]   I think there are plenty of people who totally have their economic needs covered and are
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.880]   nowhere near self-actualization or understanding their purpose or what's important to them.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:58.480]   And I've had patients who've died in poverty who had such loving and meaningful lives,
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:04.040]   and yet they couldn't afford the basics and were worried about paying for the heat.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.040]   So I get it.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.080]   I get this idea that we have to have enough money so that we can even start thinking about
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.720]   those other things, but I think we have to flatten the pyramid a little bit, and I think
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.000]   we have to think about all of them at the same time.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.120]   I don't think you can afford to wait to think about purpose.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:26.560]   I wanted to follow up on something Mike Piper's been talking about, this idea of how it's
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:34.880]   suboptimal for people to save and save and save and not, if they have more than enough,
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:41.300]   to die with a bunch of money and give their kids who are then in their 60s, you know,
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:46.400]   this inheritance, how it's ideal if you can try to find a way to do some lifetime giving.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.520]   Do you have any reflections on that concept, Jordan?
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:57.720]   Yeah, I mean, part of living a life of purpose is to connect and make connections and community
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.200]   with the people around you.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.720]   So you can wait till you die, obviously, to give away all your money, but what an amazing
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:10.600]   effect it has to do that while you're alive and can talk to those people and can be involved
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.240]   with them and can see your money doing well in the world.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:19.200]   So, you know, I think either is okay, and I love this idea that people want to pass
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.880]   on their wealth and to do good with it.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.600]   But why not do that now, like Paul Merriman, in fact, is doing, right?
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:31.280]   He just gave a huge amount of money to an educational institution.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.800]   He will be able to live in that purpose now.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.520]   And he will be able to go and teach at that institution.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:44.000]   And not only did he then give the money, but will be able to continue in a sense in his
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.720]   purpose as he goes and gives lectures and interacts with people and changes lives.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.840]   So I think you can wait.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.920]   But if you can get to that point where you're comfortable with enough, which a lot of us
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.120]   still have trouble with that, but if you can get to that point where you're comfortable
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.340]   with enough, why not live some of those things out now?
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:11.020]   You have been aligned with the FIRE community, the Financial Independence Retire Early community.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:17.220]   We had Brad Barrett here yesterday, who is also a FIRE guy.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.820]   But let's talk about the evolution of FIRE, because I'm happy to see that it seems to
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:27.820]   have moved away from the RE, the retire early, to be more on the financial independence piece.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.260]   Can you talk about your perspective on that issue?
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.260]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.180]   Brad was interesting because he wanted to make sure at the beginning of his talk, he
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.420]   said, look, we don't really talk about FIRE anymore.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.240]   We talk about F-I, financial independence.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.220]   And the reason why is the movement really has evolved quite a bit.
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:47.220]   At the beginning of this movement, I call that, people have been talking about financial
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.220]   independence forever.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.860]   I mean, go back hundreds of years, Benjamin Franklin, other people have been talking about
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.220]   financial independence.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.300]   But it really caught hold in the 2000s.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:01.140]   And at that time, a lot of people were involved in the movement were young, particularly men,
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.740]   often highly educated, like engineers, who did not like their jobs, and wanted to do
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.160]   what I call front loading the sacrifice.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.020]   They wanted to work really hard, make a lot of money, even if they had to grind it out
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:19.220]   and not enjoy themselves, and then hit a retirement date and never work again.
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:24.000]   That was kind of the beginning vision of what FIRE, financial independence, could be.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.880]   But it has evolved over the years.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.600]   And it's really moved much more to lifestyle design.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:37.700]   So this idea that I can grind it out and do something I don't like and retire early and
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:42.240]   then find freedom then, or I can start building freedom in my life now.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.340]   And instead of thinking of work as anathema, we can start thinking about creating the work
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:52.300]   environment we can live with, and maybe prolong that period and retire later.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.900]   So here's where we see these ideas like Slow-Fi and Coast-Fi, and we can go into what all
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:56.900]   those are.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:01.540]   These are ways of building in the life you want to live today, instead of deferring it
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:05.700]   to some date 10 or 15 years down the road.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:10.840]   And so I think this has been a really nice evolution to realize that we don't have to
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:16.840]   wait to some long-term plan to start pursuing purpose and doing the things we want.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.680]   We can start doing those today.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:25.180]   And in fact, it's okay to prolong your work life, because if you can create a situation
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:30.300]   in which you really like your life and still work, then you can do that for much longer
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.300]   periods of time.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:36.500]   I often like to speculate what my life would have been if I had discovered hospice at the
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.140]   beginning of my career.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:44.440]   I guarantee I would have made a lot less money, but I probably would have enjoyed myself more,
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.740]   and I wouldn't have been able to retire in my 40s, but I probably wouldn't have wanted
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:52.320]   to retire in my 40s because I would have been much more filled up by my job.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.740]   And again, I think either way is okay, as long as we're thinking about it, but many
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:05.680]   young people today are opting for let's design a lifestyle that we enjoy both today and tomorrow.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.860]   And I think it's a much softer, better version.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:14.140]   And Christine and I have talked a lot about this idea of the conception of work.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:19.180]   A lot of people think work is a bad thing, so fire was great because you get to escape
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.180]   work.
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:24.000]   But the truth of the matter is, I consider myself retired, but I do all the things that
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.920]   people would call work 40 hours a week anyway.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.640]   I mean, I produce and create a podcast, which is a lot of work.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.200]   It's more joyful for me, so I don't dread it, I enjoy it.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.200]   I write books.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.960]   I do things that even, God forbid, make me money.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.280]   I don't do them because they make me money, I do them because they're joyful, because
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.160]   they feel purposeful to me.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:50.220]   So if you imagine you're going to work your whole life, the question is, what type of
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.680]   work do you want to do and how important is getting paid for that work?
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.820]   And you can toggle between those things to design the lifestyle you want today.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:04.200]   And so young people have been very savvy about taking what was a very stringent message about
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:10.260]   how to "fire," and they're turning it into something better, and I think it's fantastic.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:16.460]   A related question is, I have friends in my peer group who really love what they're doing.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.580]   They love their work.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:22.220]   And it's sort of insulting, we've commented among ourselves, you have people saying, "When
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.220]   will you retire?"
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.980]   And you're like, "Well, I could retire, but I really like what I'm doing."
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:32.700]   There's sort of a thing in this culture that if you hit a certain age, it's time to go.
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.140]   Not necessarily.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.820]   And that's why I love the term "financial independence," because financial independence
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:43.500]   says I am financially where I need to be, but then you get to choose what work looks
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   like in your life.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:48.580]   And for some people, that will be continuing doing exactly what they're doing now.
[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:52.000]   And again, in a lot of ways, that's winning the game.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.040]   Because you know what?
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:59.420]   If you take a job at the age of 22 that you love, and that supports your monthly needs,
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.840]   assuming you don't become disabled or have a problem, you're pretty much financially
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.460]   independent at 22.
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:10.580]   I mean, you're doing something that's purpose-filled, that makes you feel connected to the world
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:14.700]   and helps you build your sense of identity, and it's paying the bills.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.940]   There is no reason to ever change until you have to.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.300]   Now, does that mean we shouldn't save for retirement?
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.380]   No, because we know that the way you feel at 22 might not be the way you feel at 40.
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:29.420]   At 22, I couldn't even imagine doing anything but being a doctor.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:35.040]   At the age of 50, I only want to be a doctor about 10 hours a week.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.320]   But I didn't know that.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.500]   So of course we should save for retirement.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.360]   Of course we should build our net worth.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.180]   Of course we should invest wisely.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.140]   But don't be afraid to love your life.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:52.380]   And if that includes the work you're doing, being employed and getting paid for it, that's
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.380]   fantastic.
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:58.140]   >> Well, Jordan, thank you so much for being here.
