[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   On Wednesdays, we dive back into the 1,200 sermons we have of Pastor John's at DesiringGod.org
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   and pull out some choice clips from some old messages.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   The following clip is taken from John Piper's sermon, "Battling the Unbelief of Lust,"
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   which he preached 25 years ago on 1 Thessalonians 4, verses 1 to 8.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   In the sermon, he explains why sexual sin is an act of unbelief.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I'm trying to explode the doctrine that the battle for obedience is optional
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   because only faith is necessary for salvation.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   This is very tricky, the way words are used here.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Here's my response.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   The battle for obedience is absolutely necessary for salvation
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   because it is the fight of faith.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   The battle for obedience is absolutely necessary for getting to heaven
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   because it is the battle against unbelief.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   It is the fight of faith.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   There are not two battles.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   One, to get yourself saved by a single act of faith,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and the other, to collect rewards by works.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   There is only one battle.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   It's the one that gets you started.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   It's the one that gets you there.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And it's the fight of faith, not works.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Faith is what severs the root of covetousness, misplaced shame, anxiety, lust,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   and tonight, envy, and six more before we're done this year.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   There is one warfare, and it is the warfare of faith.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Let's go to verse 5, and I'll try to demonstrate for you
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   why I think this text teaches that the root cause of lust is unbelief.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Verse 5 says, "Take a wife or control your body,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   not in the passion of lust, like the heathen or the Gentiles who do not know God."
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Now, do you see what that implies about the root of lust?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Not knowing God is the root cause of lust.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Not knowing God is the root cause of lust.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Now, what does that mean? Let's just think about this.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   What kind of knowledge is he talking about?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Do you remember how much the demons knew in the ministry of Jesus?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Do you remember in Mark 1 24, Jesus comes into a synagogue,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   there's a man there with an evil spirit,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Jesus is ready to cast out that evil spirit,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and out of the mouth of that demon-possessed man comes the words,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   "I know who you are, the Holy One of God."
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   The disciples didn't even know that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Do you realize how much the demons know?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   How accurate and large is their knowledge of God on many things,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   and yet they seethe with lust.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   So that's not the kind of knowledge that's being spoken of here.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You can pack your head with theological knowledge and go straight to hell.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I used to go to professional theological meetings.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I remember one in St. Louis,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   and St. Louis has some pretty gross and grisly sexual streets in it.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And what these men who teach theology in the universities around this country did,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   there is no connection between mere head knowledge and the power of godliness.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Mere head knowledge.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So what does he mean when he says,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   "When you give in to lust, you act like the Gentiles who don't know God."
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   It's a different kind of knowledge.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It's the knowledge described in 2 Corinthians 4, 6,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   where he says, "God has shown into our hearts
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ."
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   It's the knowledge of God's greatness,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   His grandeur, His glory, His beauty, His power, His wisdom,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   His justice, His goodness, His truth.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   It's a knowledge that humbles you and wins you and holds you.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It's the knowledge of God that is very unlike mere head knowledge.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's the knowledge that you don't have when you say, "Ho hum" during the Hallelujah Chorus.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   It's the knowledge that you don't have when you grumble on the rim of the Grand Canyon at sunset,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   hearing they do not hear and seeing they do not see.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It's the knowledge that you have when you're like Lydia
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   and the Lord has just opened the heart to give heed to the glory of God
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   in the face of Jesus Christ in the Gospel.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   It's the knowledge that wins, holds, humbles, ravishes, enlightens, delights.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It's the knowledge of faith, the assurance of things hoped for,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   the conviction of things not seen.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   That's the knowledge that liberates from lust, the knowledge which is faith.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It's a knowledge so real and so precious and so satisfying to your soul
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   that when any attitude or emotion or thought or addiction threatens to diminish your capacity to have and enjoy that knowledge,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   you fight it as though your very life were threatened, which it is.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Do you remember 1 Peter 2, 11? "Abstain from lustful passions that wage war against your soul."
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Your life is at stake in the way you fight your enemy called lust.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   That clip was taken from John Piper's sermon, "Battling the Unbelief of Lust," which he preached on November 13, 1988.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   He develops this connection between lust and unbelief more fully in his book, "Future Grace."
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   There, Pastor John writes, "The battle against lust is absolutely necessary for our salvation
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   because that battle is the battle against unbelief."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   That's from chapter 27 of his book, "Future Grace."
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You can find more information about the book on the book page we have at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Click on "Books" and then click on the title, "Future Grace."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Well, as we have mentioned recently, this week we host our 12th and final national conference here in Minneapolis.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Look at the book, "Reading the Bible for Yourself."
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   It should be a wonderful conference.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Well, reading the Bible for ourselves is often just a matter of time.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So how can a busy mom with young kids and a full schedule find the time she needs to read her Bible?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Tomorrow, Pastor John will offer some very practical advice to this mom.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
