[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.960]   Today we talk about a perplexing struggle for many, the struggle with self-consciousness.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.000]   Also during this season, we've been talking a lot about preaching with the release of
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.400]   your book, Pastor John, Expository Exaltation, Christian Preaching as a Worship.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.520]   That was a book that came out in April.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.920]   All of which leads to this question from Parker, a pastor in Detroit, which opens the discussion
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.680]   I think we can all benefit from.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.920]   Parker writes this, "Pastor John, in episode number 49," wow, that was a long time ago,
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.880]   back in episode 49, "you commented on how self-consciousness is the preacher's curse.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.080]   What steps would you suggest I take or which truths would you suggest I meditate on in
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.400]   order to overcome the curse of self-consciousness in the pulpit?"
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:02.000]   Well, that's right, I have said many times that I long in the pulpit not for the privilege
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.720]   of being conscious of myself and liking what I hear.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.120]   You might think, "Oh, that's what you'd want, be conscious of yourself and like what you
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.120]   hear."
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.600]   No, I would rather be unconscious of myself and so captivated by the truth that I'm preaching
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:27.700]   and so moved by love for the people in front of me that myself as a preacher is not one
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.960]   moment in my consciousness.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.720]   So yes, I'm thinking about God or Christ or salvation or obedience of faith or the cross
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.160]   or the needs of the people or the hope for outcomes.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:51.880]   I want so much to focus on that, that standing outside myself and watching myself preach
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:00.120]   is simply not happening, because if it happens, it produces all kinds of either discouragement
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.560]   or pride.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.520]   So Parker's question is, yes, that's my question.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:16.080]   Now it's not a simple matter, because not only is the immediate effort to get rid of
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.780]   self-conscious paradoxically impossible, you know, to focus on getting rid of self-consciousness
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.080]   requires self-consciousness, and that's not helpful.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.640]   But the other reason it's complicated is because the New Testament teaches that there are good
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.160]   kinds of self-consciousness.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.240]   They're not evil.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.960]   For example, we're told to examine ourselves.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.040]   We're told to deny ourselves, Mark 8:34.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.400]   And that "examine yourself" text is 2 Corinthians 13:5.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.560]   We're told to consider ourselves dead to sin, Romans 6:11.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   Keep watch over ourselves, 1 Timothy 4:16.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.160]   Preach to ourselves, Psalm 42.5.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.720]   Put on a new self, Ephesians 4:24.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:17.080]   All of these commands assume that we are aware that there is in us a consciousness that we
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.520]   are not yet completely an integrated whole.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.240]   We're divided.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.000]   We are in some sense still split, part of us leaning toward evil, part of us wanting
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.680]   to please Christ.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.560]   And as long as there is any measure of sinfulness in us, there will be a self that is aware
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.280]   of a sinning self and opposing it.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.280]   So I must not create the impression when I say I want to be free from self-consciousness,
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.880]   I must not create the impression that I'm opposed to good kind of self-consciousness.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.120]   I need to know what is good, what is bad, and what is required.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.160]   So what must we do here?
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.200]   We must first make a distinction between the good kind of freedom from self-consciousness,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.040]   the good kind of division of self, and the bad kind.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.760]   And second, even with regard to the good kind, we must recognize that there are seasons when
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.240]   it is simply not helpful to have.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.720]   So what kind of self-consciousness is not good?
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.120]   Let me read three little verses and then sum up what they say.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.760]   He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.040]   This is James 1.8 and now 4.8.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.800]   Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.120]   Cleanse your hands, you sinners.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   Purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.160]   Split.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.920]   One mind and another mind.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.280]   Now Colossians 3.22.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.320]   Bond servants, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:12.080]   service as men-pleasers, but with sincerity.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.360]   Now that word is so crucial.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:22.240]   "Aplatitos" in Greek means essentially singleness, undivided, not duplicitous.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:32.480]   So serve not with eye service as men-pleasers, but with this singleness, this sincerity,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:40.160]   this undivided, this wonderfully clear-eyed heart fearing the Lord.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.520]   And then one more verse, 2 Corinthians 2.17.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.160]   With regard to preaching, Paul says, "We are not like so many peddlers of God's Word, but
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:58.280]   as men of," same word, "sincerity, singleness, united, unified mind, as commissioned by God,
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.700]   we speak in the sight of God."
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.600]   So from those three passages, I would say that the Christian ideal in relating to other
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:17.520]   people and in preaching the Word of God in particular is to be people that are pure in
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:26.680]   the sense of free from a divided heart that, one, tries to appear one way while being another
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:36.680]   way; two, tries to say one thing while believing another thing; three, tries to be all there
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.360]   with sincere attentiveness when really part of us is somewhere else.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:51.020]   This kind of divided heart, divided consciousness, is at best insincere and at worst, we call
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.040]   it hypocrisy.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:00.320]   So that's the bad kind of self-consciousness, and we should renounce it and avoid it.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:08.360]   But like I said, even the good kind of self-consciousness, self-denial, self-assessment, watching over
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.920]   yourself, even the good kind of self-consciousness, the kind that puts to death the old man and
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.200]   denies the unloving self and keeps watch over the self so as not to fall into sin, even
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:27.600]   that good kind of self-consciousness isn't helpful in every situation.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.560]   And preaching, I think, is generally speaking one of those situations.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.440]   And one reason is that it's just plain distracting.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   It's distracting.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.160]   It's not the moment for doing that.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.380]   It's distracting from the real subject matter of the sermon and distracting from focusing
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.420]   on the people in front of us.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:58.520]   And the other reason is that such self-awareness while preaching either leads to discouragement
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   or to pride.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.400]   You know, if you don't like what you hear, you feel discouraged.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.340]   If you do like what you hear, you feel pride.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:11.520]   As we stand outside ourselves and watch ourselves, and both pride and discouragement are deadly
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   in the ministry of preaching.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.020]   So now finally I've arrived at Parker's question, "What can I do?
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.140]   What can I do to avoid it?"
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.600]   And so here are three short bullet points that I think will make a great difference.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.760]   This is the way I try anyway.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:34.440]   Number one, since this is ultimately a gift of God, since freedom from self-consciousness
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.360]   is ultimately a gift of Godâ€”you can't make it happen.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   It's paradoxical.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.280]   If you focus on making it happen, it's not happening.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.640]   Since it's a gift of God, pray earnestly for the gift of self-forgetfulness in the
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.760]   hours leading up to your preaching.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:59.560]   Number two, since the pursuit of self-forgetfulness must be indirect, since a direct pursuit is
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.760]   self-contradictory because fighting self-consciousness in the moment makes us self-conscious.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:14.520]   So since we have to pursue it indirectly, let's pursue it by stoking the fires of
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.040]   love for our subject matter and for our people.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:26.600]   The more thrilled you are with what you have to preach, the less you are going to think
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.760]   about yourself preaching.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.000]   That may be the most important thing I have to say, so I'm going to say that again.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.840]   The more thrilled we are with what we have to say about God and about His way and about
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.840]   His Son and about His gospel and about the life we have in Christ, the more thrilled
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:50.440]   we are with what we have to preach, the less we are going to think about ourselves preaching
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   it.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:58.800]   And the last thing, number three, if in the midst of preaching we do become aware of ourselves
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:06.280]   and realize this quietlyâ€”and God will give us the grace to do thisâ€”we need to say to
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.720]   that temptation, "No."
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.720]   Just speak up.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   "No."
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:19.360]   And in as much as it lies within us, consciously turn our back on that temptation of self-consciousness
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.640]   and focus again on the glorious thing we're saying and on the people in front of us.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:32.060]   So may the Lord work this miracle in all of us, not just in preaching, but in all of our
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.060]   authentic communication.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.060]   Amen.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.060]   That's helpful.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.060]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.000]   Well, the love of money is the root of every kind of evil.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.080]   So what kind of warning should be sounded to Christian entrepreneurs who have financially
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.620]   embarked on a venture to raise a lot of cash for a new business?
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.040]   We close the week with that one.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.320]   That's a great question to be asking John Piper, and we're going to do that next time
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.320]   on Friday.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
