[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.680]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.800]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.600]   First off, happy holidays to everyone.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.220]   And if you're new, I'm Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.140]   and I'm excited to have you here.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.720]   Each week, you'll normally hear me talking to an expert
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.560]   about how they became world-class
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.900]   at optimizing an aspect of their life,
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.240]   or doing a deep dive myself on a topic I've been researching,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.520]   or maybe just answering your questions,
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.400]   which by the way, I will be doing next week,
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.200]   so please send some in.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.780]   But given that it's the last episode of the year,
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.620]   I wanted to do something different and a little special.
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.780]   I wanna recap the 10 biggest takeaways
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.960]   and learnings I've had from the past 94 episodes,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.920]   and the ones that I'm gonna be focusing on
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.420]   in my own life in the year ahead.
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.760]   After that, I'm gonna share some of my top hacks
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.500]   from the year, as well as my favorite credit cards
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100]   from 2022, based on my actual spending data.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.940]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.280]   Okay, so I wanted to do these takeaways in order,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.700]   but someone managed to trick Amex Travel
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.980]   into putting $5,000 of flights on my credit card,
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.900]   so I just spent the last few hours
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.240]   trying to get my funds back,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.900]   which it turns out will be easy,
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.000]   but also to make sure the scammers return flights,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.500]   which happened to leave tonight, are canceled.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.840]   As all this plays out, I'll definitely share more,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.300]   but given that I can see the full United info,
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.080]   David Weaverling and Ethan Butler,
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.000]   good luck getting back to Pittsburgh tonight,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.960]   because your return flight was canceled.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.420]   So while I didn't get to put these in a perfect priority,
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.300]   I did save my top two for last.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.440]   But takeaway number one is all about time.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.980]   I've talked to a handful of people
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.140]   about time management and productivity,
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.820]   but the story that's really stuck in my head the most
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.700]   is from Laura Vanderkam in episode seven,
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.900]   where we talked about time management.
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.440]   To illustrate the point that we should stop saying,
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.200]   "I don't have time,"
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.320]   she talked about what would happen
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.320]   if your water heater started flooding,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.080]   and the three to four hours that would magically free up
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.460]   in your day so you could deal with the issue.
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.840]   Ever since that episode, I've been trying to catch myself
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.540]   from saying, "I don't have time,"
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.880]   and start realizing that if I don't have time,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.560]   I'm either overcommitting
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.560]   or probably poorly prioritizing my day.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.920]   I won't say that I've become a true expert here,
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.480]   but I'm getting a lot better,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.180]   and I'm really excited to focus on this next year.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.020]   A few of the things that have been helpful for me
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.560]   are doing a calendar audit,
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.220]   which involved trying to be more diligent
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.780]   about tracking what I'm doing
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.560]   so that I could really review how I spent my time.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.980]   Even if it's just for a week,
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.020]   it is so helpful to see how you actually spend
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.620]   the 168 hours you have each week.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.860]   The other thing I've been working on
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.780]   came from a great reminder from Brandon Turner
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.660]   in episode 82.
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.420]   He discussed how important it is
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.040]   to learn to drop the right balls and establish boundaries.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.920]   Since then, I've been getting much better about saying no
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.040]   to meetings that I don't wanna prioritize
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.380]   and taking my time to follow up on things
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.100]   that really aren't at the top of the priority list.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.760]   One other tactic I've been trying
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.180]   is asking people to send me questions
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.640]   instead of schedule meetings.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.940]   And I've suggested that they use a tool called Loom
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.740]   to record the conversation.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.440]   That way, one, I can respond asynchronously on my own time,
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.280]   and two, I can actually speed up the video to 2X.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.660]   The third side benefit
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.200]   is that actually this forces some people to just give up
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.080]   and not actually try to schedule a meeting.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.120]   So that's a tactic I've been using.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.080]   I know that some of this prioritization
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.540]   means that some of you listening
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.040]   didn't get a reply to me as fast as I used to,
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.840]   but I'm working on finding a good balance
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.580]   and I still plan to reply to everyone.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.880]   Also, I just recorded an episode a couple of days ago
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.960]   that'll come out on January 18th with Dan Martell,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.760]   who has a book coming out called "Buy Back Your Time."
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.600]   And it gave me so many good ideas
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.260]   on how I can be more intentional
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.960]   about spending my money as a trade-off for time in 2023.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.880]   So to summarize takeaway one is that I have plenty of time.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.060]   I just need to get better about prioritizing it
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.440]   and saying no to things that are less important.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.020]   Also, if you notice me mentioning
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.020]   all of the past episodes by number,
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.220]   like number seven with Laura Vanderkam,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.980]   that's to make it really easy for you guys to go find them.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.480]   Either by scrolling through the feed
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.440]   in the app you're listening to this podcast right now,
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.440]   or if you go to allthehacks.com/seven
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.900]   or any episode number,
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.980]   it'll take you directly to the show notes page
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.620]   for that episode and the links on that page,
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.540]   at least the ones for Apple, Spotify, and Google Podcasts,
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.860]   should open exactly to that episode in the player app.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.960]   Okay, my second big takeaway is all about automating
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   and simplifying your finances.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.420]   It came up in episode 42 with Ben Carlson,
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.220]   19 with Andy Ratcliffe,
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.460]   but the first thing I'll share
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.180]   is from Ramit Sethi in episode nine.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.840]   He shared his money rules and I loved it.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.380]   For him, they're things like never question spending money
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.380]   on books, appetizers, health,
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.300]   or donating to a friend's charity fundraiser,
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.480]   and always have one year of emergency funds in cash.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.300]   The idea of coming up with a few rules
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.760]   to simplify some financial decisions is so awesome.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.940]   He also has one for business class on flights over four hours
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.980]   which I think just takes away the headache
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.700]   of trying to make a decision about when to upgrade.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.240]   Though for me, four hours or any number of hours
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.120]   is probably not worth spending the dollars
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.400]   on business class,
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.320]   but if I can do it for points, I definitely will.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.240]   Amy and I actually had a conversation about this
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.540]   and we started putting a few rules together.
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.920]   One of the ones we have is discuss any purchase
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   over $200 with each other,
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.300]   but I really wanna put together
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.840]   a more complete list next year
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.260]   that's more like the 10 rules Ramit has
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.180]   that I'll also link to in the show notes.
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.420]   Another big thing for me was trying to simplify my finances.
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.940]   For the past five to six years,
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.360]   I've been building consumer finance apps,
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.520]   which has led me to open different banking
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.560]   and investment accounts at so many different institutions.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.980]   But I realized that having my money spread out
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.820]   across so many different places
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.980]   made the whole process of money management
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.700]   more stressful than it needed to be.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.280]   Fortunately, my investments were easy
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.200]   because I'd already moved pretty much everything
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.660]   to Wealthfront and I have no plans to take it out
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.740]   now that I've left as an employee.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.120]   I'm really happy to pay their nominal fee
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.460]   for software to manage my investments
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.620]   and my tax loss harvesting and rebalancing
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.720]   far more efficiently than I can.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.120]   Not to mention the peace of mind
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.460]   of just not having to think about it.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.340]   So going into 2023, my goal is to get as simple as I can.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.720]   Ideally, we have just one checking account,
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.920]   one high-yield cash account, one brokerage account,
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.520]   and then hopefully we can consolidate
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.900]   all our retirement accounts into four.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.440]   Two for each 401(k) where we roll over
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.360]   all our past employers' 401(k)s into those
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.200]   and two Roth IRAs.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.780]   And while that might seem like a lot,
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.080]   I think at one point we had at least two dozen
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.380]   checking, savings, brokerage, and retirement accounts
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.800]   all with a balance in them.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.500]   Then when it comes to saving each month,
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.500]   I'm really excited for the simplicity
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.800]   to make it even easier to automate.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.420]   I spent so much time at Wealthfront
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.100]   building a product called Autopilot
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.960]   because I really think that the easiest way
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.040]   to manage your finances is to just automate things.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.580]   With Autopilot, you can say leave this much in checking,
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.500]   keep this much in an emergency fund,
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.740]   and move any excess to a series of accounts
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.820]   that you can set caps on, like your IRA, your 529,
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.040]   or just your taxable brokerage account.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.280]   If you want to check out Wealthfront,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.540]   you should use my link at allthehacks.com/wealthfront.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.200]   It'll be so nice to have everything simplified next year,
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.580]   but even nicer if we can set up those money rules
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.660]   and make our financial decision-making easier too.
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.120]   My next big learning was all about negotiating.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.000]   Episode 17 with Kwame Christian,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.260]   who runs the American Negotiation Institute,
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.840]   really was a masterclass in negotiation.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.340]   So I won't recap the whole episode,
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.840]   but one big takeaway is that negotiating
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.100]   can really be thought of as all about asking
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.680]   better questions and that those better questions
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.180]   will lead to a better result.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.560]   So before you enter any negotiation,
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.360]   take the time to ask yourself what you want and why,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.980]   ask yourself what the other side wants and why,
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.400]   and then write down all the open-ended questions
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.900]   you could possibly ask in the conversation.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.360]   Doing those three things is usually the best prep
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.700]   you can do for any negotiation.
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.540]   I also loved hearing Kwame's
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.500]   compassionate curiosity framework
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.740]   that he uses for every negotiation.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.620]   It starts with acknowledging and validating
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.000]   the other side's feelings and emotions,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.920]   then getting curious with compassion
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.620]   and asking them questions,
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.840]   which ultimately allows you to productively
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.380]   joint problem-solve to a resolution.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.180]   Now that I'm running a business full-time,
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.020]   I imagine I'll be much more involved
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.260]   in negotiations next year,
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260]   so I'm excited to put some of this knowledge to work.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.400]   Though I've actually been using
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.220]   the compassionate curiosity framework
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.480]   to negotiate with my two-year-old recently,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.400]   and I've had some decent success.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.660]   The other really important negotiation tactic I learned
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.360]   was from Andy Ratcliffe,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.940]   who co-founded Wealthfront and Benchmark Capital,
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.540]   which, for those who don't know,
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.440]   was probably the most successful
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.660]   venture capital firm of all time.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.420]   And in episode 19, he shared the tactic he uses
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.120]   for every negotiation,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.000]   which is to put the gun in the other person's hand,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.580]   and if they fire, don't work with them.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.220]   He explained that most people don't want to be thought of
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.220]   as taking advantage of others, and it works so well,
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.300]   and for the very small percentage of people
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.760]   that always ask for something well in excess of fair,
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.480]   you just walk away from negotiating with them.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.360]   So hopefully some of those lessons
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.320]   can help you negotiate next year,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.280]   though definitely go back to episode 17
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.940]   if you want to go deeper on this.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.580]   For number four, I want to talk about regret.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.040]   It turns out I had at least three episodes
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.280]   that either in part or in whole were about regret.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.000]   First, I talked to Ben Nimton in episode 37
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.540]   about bucket lists,
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.000]   but his whole journey began after he learned
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.420]   that more than 75% of people at the end of their lives
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.040]   regret not living life on their own terms.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.300]   And while we've all heard people say they have no regrets,
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.220]   I learned in an amazing conversation
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.480]   with best-selling author Dan Pink in episode 40
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.180]   that regret is one of the most instructive emotions we have.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.900]   Naturally, every functioning person has regrets,
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.020]   and they're an essential part of our cognitive machinery.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.160]   We talked about the four kinds of regret
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.560]   and how to manage them towards your own future happiness.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.980]   For example, one of the biggest buckets of regret
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.320]   are regrets of boldness, not taking that bold action.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.080]   And Dan said the simple hack for preventing that
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.080]   is when you're trying to make a bold decision for yourself,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.160]   stop framing it as what you're doing
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.840]   and ask yourself what you would advise a friend to do
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.180]   and act according to your advice.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.380]   Finally, if you want to go deeper about regrets
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.060]   and start thinking about living a more purposeful life,
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.060]   definitely take a listen to my conversation
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.480]   with Jordan Grumman in episode 74,
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.640]   who happens to be a hospice doctor
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.480]   and personal finance writer.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.520]   So he brought a fascinating perspective
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.120]   on how purpose, identity, and connection
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.360]   can be so much more important in life than money.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.460]   So what does all this mean for life and 2023?
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.800]   Well, I think in the same way that I want to be intentional
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.760]   with how I spend the hours of the day,
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.080]   I want to be intentional with big things too.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.720]   The way our family spends time together,
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.720]   the trips we take, the friends we hang out with,
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.920]   and a lot more.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.800]   So Amy and I are really gonna spend some time
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.000]   over the next few weeks talking about what we want
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.540]   in our lives next year.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.800]   I want to tell you all about the most amazing way
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.200]   to buy a second home.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   And I know because we actually bought one
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.080]   for 1/8th the cost.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.160]   And don't worry, I'm not talking timeshares,
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.840]   I'm talking about Picasso,
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.320]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   So how does it work?
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.680]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.160]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160]   creates an LLC for each home,
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.200]   and you can buy as little as 1/8th of the property.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.520]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.440]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   handling design, cleaning, bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.360]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.640]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.840]   When we found Picasso,
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.320]   it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.440]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.360]   we toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.820]   Since then, it's truly become our second home,
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.520]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.800]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.160]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.480]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.640]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.000]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.240]   For a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.320]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.860]   where our listeners will get a free Picasso Access account,
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.520]   which means you can see new listings
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.320]   before they go on the website
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.400]   and get up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.320]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.960]   P-A-C-A-S-S-O.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.000]   I used Daffy to organize all my giving
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.160]   and charitable tax savings in one place,
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.000]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.240]   Daffy is a new modern way to give
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.800]   that makes it so much easier
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.840]   to maximize your charitable deductions,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.000]   especially before the December 31st deadline.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.960]   They do that by helping you set up a donor-advised fund,
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.640]   or DAF, which is a tax-advantaged account
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.760]   that lets you contribute cash or assets now,
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.600]   qualify for the tax deduction in 2022,
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.760]   and then gives you time and flexibility
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.600]   in distributing the money to the charities who need it.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.120]   I love using Daffy because it makes it so easy
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.960]   to put money aside for charity,
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.000]   and my favorite part is that it lets you be more strategic
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.120]   with your giving and your tax planning
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.000]   by having a single source of charitable deductions.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.080]   Plus, you don't have to deal with the hassle
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.520]   of tracking receipts from your donations.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.800]   To make all your tax-deductible donations
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.000]   before year-end in one place,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.880]   go to allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.240]   Plus, for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.160]   you can get a free $25 to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.160]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.840]   And on the topic of my relationship with Amy,
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.600]   takeaway number five is that we should all strive
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.720]   for an 80/80 marriage, at least those of us
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.680]   who are in a committed relationship.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.440]   When I spoke with Nate and Kaylee Klemp in episode 43,
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.960]   it was fascinating to talk about how relationships
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.200]   have evolved from a traditional 80/20 relationship
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.080]   decades ago, where one partner, usually the woman,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.200]   did all the work in the relationship and for the family,
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.000]   because the other was the breadwinner.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.120]   As things evolved, we got to a place more like 50/50,
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.160]   which is, I think, where most of us are today.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.320]   Well, except for maybe those
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.320]   who already listened to episode 43.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.440]   But the challenge with 50/50 is that so many couples
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.600]   end up keeping score of who's done more dishes
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.000]   or spent more time budgeting or done more kid's bedtimes.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.840]   And that kind of competition can be exhausting
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.560]   and certainly doesn't make for a better relationship.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.040]   So after hundreds of interviews with couples,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.280]   Nate and Kaylee coined the concept of an 80/80 marriage,
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.640]   where both partners assumed each other are doing the best
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.580]   and tried to pull more than 50% of the weight.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.060]   It takes time and practice to get it to work,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.420]   but I can say that it's certainly been a welcome change
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.760]   for our relationship.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.880]   In fact, I recently went back and re-listened to episode 43
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.760]   so I could brush up in advance of 2023,
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.240]   because my relationship with Amy
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.400]   is something I really wanna focus on more now
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.040]   that we have two kids to manage every day as well.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.000]   And that episode had some great tactics
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.260]   for putting the concept of an 80/80 marriage into place.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.600]   My sixth takeaway is short,
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.720]   but it's something I bring up all the time.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.120]   And it's from an episode I've listened to multiple times.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.800]   In fact, I've actually re-watched it on YouTube
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.680]   because I think the video adds a lot to the story.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.040]   That's episode 46 with Vanessa Van Edwards,
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.560]   and it's all about mastering the secret language
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.800]   of charismatic communication.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.160]   I knew the first time I heard Vanessa explain
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.540]   her formula for charisma
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.000]   that I had to bring her on the podcast.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.840]   In the episode, she shared so many great tactics
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.480]   for implementing the right balance of warmth and competence
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.520]   that I use almost every day.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.720]   For example, knowing that lots of emojis
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.120]   and exclamation points, both of which I use a lot,
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.680]   can drive a warmth.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.560]   I either try to tone them down
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.520]   or maybe balance them out in an email
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.040]   where it makes sense to share some data or charts
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.720]   to increase my perceived competence.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.920]   Anyways, I won't recap the whole episode,
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.840]   but if your life or work relies on communicating with others,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.120]   which I'm guessing it does,
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.840]   you should definitely check it out.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.680]   And as much as I love talking about points and miles,
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.040]   I wasn't actually sure that there would be anything
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.440]   in this episode that made it to my top 10,
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.800]   but as I reflected on the year, I was wrong.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.780]   I've spent so much time trying to optimize
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.040]   for getting the most dollar per point value
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.000]   that I've been doing myself a huge disservice.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   In fact, while I know I'm very fortunate
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.240]   to have millions of points and miles,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.760]   I'm actually realizing I should probably be more embarrassed
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.160]   that I'm not using them enough.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.200]   There've been plenty of times
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.480]   that I opted to pay for flights with cash
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.160]   instead of using points
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.520]   because it wasn't the most optimal redemption,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.120]   even if it was a good one.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.280]   Well, in episode 89, Tiffany Funk,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.400]   who's overseen one of the biggest travel and points sites
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.460]   on the internet for over a decade,
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.580]   really helped me put things in perspective
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.100]   and form this takeaway number seven.
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.860]   Not only did she remind me
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.500]   that you don't always need to get the perfect deal,
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.340]   but she busted a lot of myths I'd been adhering to
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.080]   about when to use your points.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.140]   For example, it's long been talked about
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.420]   that the best use of points
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.840]   is on international business class flights,
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.100]   but she pointed out that there have been
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.460]   a lot of great domestic redemptions
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.220]   in the past few years as well.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.980]   So needless to say, in 2023,
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.420]   I hope we start burning down our points balance
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.860]   and stop searching for the perfect deal.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.660]   Though let's be real, that'll be very hard,
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.160]   and I'm sure I'll still be searching
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.340]   for the perfect deal too.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.820]   I hope I can just get comfortable
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.720]   taking a less perfect deal as well.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.920]   So stay tuned.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.580]   Okay, number eight is a bit of a work in progress.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.300]   In episode 85, I talked with Tiago Forte
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.140]   about building a second brain,
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.900]   and it was such a great episode
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.100]   that inspired me to change a lot of the ways
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.900]   I save and consume information.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.500]   For example, I'm now saving so much of the content
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.540]   I find online to a read later app called Matter,
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.900]   which saves me time for three reasons.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.520]   First, I can batch together all my information consumption.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.060]   Second, they do a great job at text to speech,
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.420]   so I can actually listen to those long Atlantic articles
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.300]   instead of needing to read them.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.660]   But third, and maybe most importantly,
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.100]   at least 50% of the things I save
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.700]   lose their importance by the time
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.200]   I actually come back to them,
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.460]   which means that article that might have interrupted my day
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.580]   for 10 or 15 minutes is something I never end up reading,
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.140]   which is obviously a massive time saver.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.140]   But a read later app is just one of the ways
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.260]   I wanna get more serious
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.520]   about how I organize my digital life in 2023.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.060]   I think with a little bit of intention and organization,
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.620]   especially when it comes to notes and tasks,
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.820]   I can really step things up next year,
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.720]   and I'm fairly certain I'll be re-listening
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.700]   to that episode in a few weeks because it was so good.
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.360]   Okay, I said I was gonna save my two favorites for last,
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.220]   and while it's really impossible to call any two lessons
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.020]   or takeaways my top two,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.580]   as I thought about all the learnings from the past year,
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.920]   there are two that really stood out.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.460]   First was absolutely one of my biggest takeaways,
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.680]   and it's that I need to spend more time
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.900]   focusing on net fulfillment instead of net worth.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.700]   If you all listened to episode 91
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.280]   with Bill Perkins a few weeks ago,
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.140]   you already know what I'm talking about.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.380]   And if you didn't, I am tempted to say,
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.100]   just stop this episode now and go listen.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.000]   I've already re-listened to it twice
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.920]   and have lost count of the number of people
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.740]   who said it was their number one episode.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.260]   For the past 10 years,
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.940]   I feel like I've gotten caught up
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.120]   in so many of the various aspects of the FIRE movement,
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.220]   which for those unfamiliar
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.420]   is financial independence, retire early,
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.460]   and it's led me to be very frugal and save a lot
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.580]   and focus on building my net worth.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.800]   And I'm fortunate for all that savings,
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.020]   but I also worry that there were times,
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.940]   especially before we had kids,
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.940]   now that that chapter is closed,
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.700]   where we opted to save instead of spend money
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.880]   on things that would have had a big increase
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.520]   in our fulfillment in life
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.340]   and where the memories of that experience
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.440]   would pay dividends for years to come.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.280]   I'm not saying anyone should be fiscally irresponsible
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.960]   or live at $0 in their bank account,
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.960]   but I just want to reframe the whole perspective
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.120]   on money and saving towards one
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.680]   where we want to find the right way
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.160]   to allocate our money across the entirety of our lives
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.320]   so that we end up at or close to zero when it's all done.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.520]   And this new perspective is one
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.980]   that I absolutely wasn't thinking about a few months ago.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.460]   So what have I started doing differently?
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.420]   One, Amy and I are going to start thinking
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.700]   about what experiences we want to have
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.320]   over the next few years,
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.340]   both from the perspective
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.180]   that it's our last years in our 30s,
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.140]   but also that our kids will never be this young again.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.220]   Two, I want to try to ensure we can harvest the dividends
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.860]   of the memories we create.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.260]   So I'm going to be more intentional
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.780]   about trying to make sure we take photos and videos
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.620]   as we have experiences in life.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.820]   Third, I'm really going to start making decisions
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.560]   to try to maximize fulfillment.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.760]   We just did that with a trip to Europe,
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.680]   and while it wasn't the most perfect use of miles and points
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.560]   and there weren't any hotel deals we could book,
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.000]   we did it because we just knew it was an experience
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.600]   we wanted to have at this point in our life.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.080]   I'm sure there are so many more ways
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.520]   this will impact me in my life,
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.480]   and I will probably re-listen to that episode
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.920]   every few months,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.200]   but it's one of my top learnings this year.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   And if you missed it,
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.000]   definitely scroll back to episode 91
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.840]   with Bill Perkins and enjoy.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.620]   And finally, my takeaway number 10 is all about happiness,
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.220]   and it stemmed from episode 46
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.860]   with best-selling author, Arthur Brooks.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.380]   That episode was so good, I re-listened to it this morning,
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.860]   and I already have it queued up
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.900]   to listen again later this week,
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.100]   except I need to slow it down so I can take some notes.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.140]   So the first part of this takeaway
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.460]   is about how to define happiness,
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.900]   but instead of restating Brooks,
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.900]   I'll just play a clip here.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.700]   Happiness is a combination of three.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.620]   You might say they're macronutrients.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.020]   You need enjoyment, you need satisfaction,
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.420]   and you need purpose.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.780]   When I meet somebody who's not happy,
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.640]   I start looking diagnostically at these three things.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.260]   The first practical takeaway
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.160]   that comes from all this theory
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.080]   is that if somebody's like,
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.180]   "Ah, my life isn't complete.
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.420]   "Some things are good, some things aren't,
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.480]   "but I'm not really happy,"
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.040]   it means there's a lack of balance in one of these things.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.240]   Either you don't have enough enjoyment in your life,
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.180]   or you're actually not hitting goals,
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.980]   which means you don't have satisfaction,
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.880]   or you don't have a sense of purpose
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.060]   and direction in your life.
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.820]   It's one of those three things.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.020]   And so that's the first place to start looking
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.760]   if you feel like you're not where you wanna be
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.100]   in terms of your happiness.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.980]   - That was such a great lesson for me,
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.820]   but just learning what happiness is isn't enough.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.740]   We also talked about how to impact it.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.340]   And one of the biggest learnings I had
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.660]   came from understanding
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.340]   our fluid and crystallized intelligence curves.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.900]   And for some quick context,
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.900]   fluid intelligence is your ability
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.180]   to process new information, learn, and solve problems,
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.620]   while crystallized intelligence is your stored knowledge
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.640]   that you've accumulated over the years.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.140]   The big takeaway was that in our 20s and 30s,
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.420]   our fluid intelligence curve is at its peak,
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.600]   and we can rely and really thrive with it.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.240]   But as we move into our 40s and older,
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.660]   the tides start to shift,
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.060]   and our crystallized intelligence or wisdom starts to form,
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.100]   and realizing that and finding work that can harness it
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.220]   is really the key to happiness with our work
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.080]   for the next few decades.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.660]   While it may seem obvious to some,
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.460]   it really helped me start to think about
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.100]   what I should be doing professionally
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.820]   and the next chapter of life.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.660]   And funny enough,
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.940]   I think transitioning to all the hacks full-time
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.900]   is really a reflection of wanting to shift
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.120]   and make a jump onto that crystallized intelligence curve.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.200]   Honestly, I could keep going on this episode.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.740]   We talked about how journaling
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.220]   can be one of the most valuable habits
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.520]   to start doing each day,
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.820]   which is something I'm gonna try to start doing next year.
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.740]   And beyond journaling,
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.340]   we talked about the four things
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.300]   that you need to focus on each day,
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.600]   and I'll just play another clip
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.700]   instead of trying to say it myself.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.860]   If you wanna be among the happiest people,
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.660]   they all do these things every day.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.100]   They practice their faith or life philosophy.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.300]   You don't have to be religious.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.540]   You just have something bigger than you
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.260]   that zooms you out on your own life.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.100]   Life philosophy or faith or a spiritual practice
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.480]   gives you that uniquely.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.700]   So it's meditation or prayer or studying the Stoics,
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.860]   whatever it happens to be,
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.380]   you gotta do your thing and you gotta do it seriously.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.620]   Second is family, the ties that bind and don't break.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.620]   It's important that you not choose them,
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.460]   but that you have them for your happiness.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.620]   And God knows in many cases we wouldn't choose them.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.820]   The third is friendship.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.820]   We have a major loneliness crisis in the United States.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.500]   The average number of close friends
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.180]   that somebody 30 years old has
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.700]   has been cut in half in the past 20 years.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.140]   About half of people under 30
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.700]   say that no one knows them well.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.820]   It's horrible for every aspect of happiness.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:24.960]   And part of the reason for that
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.860]   is that everybody knows how to make deal friends,
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.060]   but we know less and less how to make real friends.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.420]   And the last is work.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.580]   And work doesn't mean working hard all night long.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.100]   It doesn't mean making tons of money.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.220]   It doesn't mean having prestige.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.020]   It means exactly two things.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.100]   Earning your success,
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.860]   meaning your skills meet your passions,
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.140]   and serving other people, the people who need you.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.900]   If you earn your success and you're serving other people,
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.840]   I don't care if you're an electrician or a librarian
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.420]   or a podcast host or a Harvard professor,
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.540]   you will be happy from your work.
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.020]   And if you don't have those things,
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.500]   you won't be happy from your work.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.700]   Faith, family, friends, and work are the big four.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.020]   So I could keep going,
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.020]   but instead you should just go back
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.620]   and listen to episode 47 with Arthur Brooks.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.140]   It is chocked full of great advice and tactics
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.100]   to be happier in 2023.
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:10.940]   And I, for one,
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.300]   am going to be putting a lot of that into action next year.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.700]   All right, it was so hard
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.180]   to try to narrow everything I've learned
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.860]   down to just 10 things.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.040]   And unfortunately there were so many great things
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.140]   that didn't make the cut.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.940]   Since I'm not working at a company anymore,
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.980]   I left off a few episodes from this list
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.900]   because they're not big takeaways for me right now.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.820]   But if you are working for a company
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.640]   and especially in a leadership role,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.380]   you should definitely go check out three episodes,
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.820]   number 39 with submarine commander, David Marquet,
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.620]   number 57 with Navy SEAL commander, Mike Hayes,
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.540]   and number 90 with product builder extraordinaire,
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.940]   Lenny Ruchitsky.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.820]   But if you think that there's an important takeaway
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.940]   or lesson that I missed,
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.240]   I would love to hear from you
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.660]   because I'm always curious what you think.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.020]   But that's enough lessons and takeaways for now.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.100]   Let's also talk about the best hacks from 2022.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.540]   You all know I love credit card points.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.500]   So I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today,
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.120]   which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.860]   It's a free app that helps you manage
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.060]   all of your credit cards in one place
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.140]   and makes it easy to find the right card
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.780]   to maximize your category bonuses on every purchase.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.980]   You can also load it on your partner's phone
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.980]   so they always know the best cards to use.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.960]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.360]   and recurring credit from over 5,000 cards.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.240]   And they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase,
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.600]   Bank of America, or Citibank offers
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.080]   to save even more money every day.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.600]   And with their browser extension,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.200]   you can actually activate every single Amex and Chase offer
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.800]   in just one click.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.280]   And because of that massive credit card database,
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.780]   you can do all of this without having to give up
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.320]   any personal or banking details.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.100]   The app is free to download
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.520]   and many of the features are free as well.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.280]   But if you wanna try out the pro version,
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.600]   there's a free trial.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.400]   And if you decide you wanna sign up after the trial,
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.060]   which you probably will,
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.020]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.720]   to get 20% off.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.120]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.000]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.140]   for a good hang.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.220]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.160]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.100]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.040]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.820]   take care of the supplies.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.640]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.500]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.900]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.860]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.340]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.420]   that you got through another week.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.540]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.060]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.840]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.940]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.580]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.160]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.140]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.180]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.020]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.060]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.700]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.180]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.820]   So, whatever the occasion,
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.100]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.140]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.360]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.260]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.740]   and supporting the show.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.580]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.300]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.060]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.620]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.920]   So, please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.900]   Coming in at number one has to be the hack
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.780]   that's resulted in the most emails from you all,
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.740]   which is booking a hotel directly and emailing them
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.780]   to tell them you're excited to stay.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.820]   Big thanks to Lee Rowan for sharing it in episode one
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.420]   and Julia Menez for sharing it
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:06.520]   alongside a template for doing it in episode 55.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.340]   I've heard from over a hundred listeners
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.740]   about using this hack to get upgrades,
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.060]   bottles of wine, free food, vouchers for drinks at the bar,
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.820]   free parking, and maybe most ridiculously,
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.660]   pillows embroidered with initials on them.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.460]   So, I hope that this hack continues to bring you
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.260]   upgrades and more in 2023.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.500]   And if you're new and want more details about it,
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.260]   definitely go back and listen to episode one or episode 55.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.580]   Next is probably the second most popular hack
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.860]   I've heard from listeners about,
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.340]   and that's finding free unclaimed money
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.720]   that you're owed on your state's unclaimed money website.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.340]   I think the biggest winner was a listener
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.420]   who found over $1,000 for her and her family,
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.380]   but I've had dozens of people find over $100
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.220]   and countless people who found at least $20.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.980]   So, if you haven't checked yourself, definitely do that.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.460]   And if you're with friends or family
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.140]   for the last few days of the year,
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.980]   and you can look them up and surprise them
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.500]   at dinner with free money,
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.860]   then surely that would make a great holiday gift for them.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.380]   So, two more travel hacks that have been awesome.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.420]   One, taking the main photo from a vacation rental
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.940]   on Airbnb or VRBO and doing a reverse image search
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.340]   to find it on other and probably more cheaper sites.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.300]   This one is great.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.860]   I did use this tactic in Paris and found an alternative site
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.500]   to book a place we were considering for 20% less.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.700]   Big shout out to Lee Rowan
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.080]   for sharing that all the way back in episode one,
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.060]   which is still the all-time most popular episode
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.600]   in this podcast and definitely worth a listen
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.140]   if you like travel hacks.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.820]   Two, for rental cars,
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.220]   AutoSlash has saved me
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.060]   and countless listeners hundreds of dollars.
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.380]   I actually interviewed the CEO, Jonathan, in episode 66,
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.740]   and I think it was effectively a masterclass
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.660]   on getting deals on car rentals.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.660]   So, before you book your next rental car,
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.100]   or even if you already made a reservation,
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.900]   at a minimum, check out AutoSlash,
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.280]   but probably go back and listen to all of episode 66.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.700]   Okay, this next hack is one I used earlier today,
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.220]   and it's a trick I learned from Nir Eyal in episode 25,
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.820]   where we talked about distraction
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.620]   and how you can become indistractable.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.200]   For me, it was a hack for saying no
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.980]   to delicious, unhealthy food in the house.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.860]   The trick is not to say no,
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.420]   but to give yourself permission to have it in five minutes.
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.600]   By then, you've almost always moved on to something else
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.580]   and have lost your craving,
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.980]   and this morning, it resulted in me eating
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.460]   at least one or two less molasses cookies,
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.860]   which I will call a win.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.940]   Continuing on the health side are two hacks from my episode
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.100]   with the host of the Healthier Together podcast, Liz Moody.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.860]   First is taping your mouth shut at night.
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.900]   It sounded crazy to me and probably took six months
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.620]   to actually try it, but I am sold.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.260]   The team at Hostage Tape sent me their mouth tape
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.340]   a few weeks ago, and I've been using it almost every night.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.660]   I feel like I breathe better
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.500]   and my mouth doesn't get as dry at night.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.420]   The second is cold showers.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.100]   I did it for 30 days straight,
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.180]   but I will be honest, I haven't been as consistent since.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.860]   However, I wanna get this trend back up again in 2023,
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.940]   because when you start your day with a cold shower
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.020]   or a cold plunge, I just feel like anything else
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:15.140]   that comes your way is so much more manageable.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.660]   Another hack on the health side is that you should never pay
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.420]   the first healthcare bill you get,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.560]   and that's for so many reasons that I learned
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.980]   when I fractured my foot and got shingles
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.860]   all in a few months.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.620]   Thanks to reporter Marshall Allen,
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.640]   who actually wrote the book on fighting back
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.300]   against medical bills and winning,
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.300]   who joined me on episode 34,
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.060]   I was armed with the knowledge I needed
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.180]   to save thousands of dollars.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.220]   I was amazed at the inaccuracies
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.460]   of some of these medical bills
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.540]   that I took the time to review.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.100]   It was crazy that just by pushing back,
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.900]   I got my insurance to cover bills
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.580]   that they wouldn't cover at first.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.300]   And the most wild thing was that some of the bills
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.780]   you get in the mail aren't actually bills.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.620]   I'm not kidding.
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.360]   It is perfectly legal for someone to send you a letter
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.740]   that looks like a bill, but it's actually just a request
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.500]   that if you wanna pay them the extra
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.740]   beyond what your insurance company has paid them, you can.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.640]   That happened for me with a $300 medical boot
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.420]   that my insurance only covered for $75,
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.280]   and the letter I received made it seem
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.740]   like I owed the difference,
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.940]   but the reality was I didn't owe anything at all.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.040]   It is all a total racket, and if you wanna learn more
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.220]   or get help fighting back on any of your medical bills,
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.020]   either check out episode 34
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.420]   or just reach out directly to Marshall Allen.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.980]   He loves helping people in these situations.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.580]   So not quite health-related,
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:35.140]   but definitely a brain hack is for remembering things.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.140]   If you already know how to build a memory palace,
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.940]   then you can skip ahead a few seconds,
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.820]   but it was so fascinating to talk
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.500]   to two-time world memory champion Johannes Malo
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.060]   in episode 30 about the tactics he uses
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.660]   to memorize everything from lists to names to numbers,
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.340]   and they're all skills he taught himself later in life,
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.820]   so you can easily pick them up too.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.460]   That episode was so fun and a bit interactive,
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.300]   so I hope you enjoy it.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.800]   And finally, my last hack to share today
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.860]   is a fun one from Nick Gray,
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.540]   and it's to stop inviting people over for dinner
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.980]   and start hosting cocktail parties.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.580]   It's so much easier.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.700]   You don't need food.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.040]   You can put a two-hour hard stop on the event
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.100]   and kick people out.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.880]   It lets you spend time with more people in a shorter window,
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.460]   and all around is just more fun.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.580]   While my All the Hacks event in San Francisco
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.340]   probably bent the rules for an easy cocktail party,
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.340]   it was so fun, and I look forward to doing more events
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.780]   and cocktail parties in 2023,
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.740]   so definitely check out episode 68 with Nick Gray
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:36.900]   to hear about his formula for the perfect cocktail party.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.620]   All right, there were obviously so many more hacks
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.060]   than I included above, so if you want more,
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.260]   there's almost a hundred episodes of the show
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.540]   to go listen to and a few dozen newsletters
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.500]   that you can check out at allthehacks.com/email.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.140]   But to wrap up this episode,
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:55.940]   I wanted to run through my top credit cards for 2022.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.720]   I looked at my spending summary for the year,
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.980]   and it was really dominated by four cards
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.740]   that have become my main four for non-business expenses.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.060]   First is the Amex Gold, which is my dining/grocery card,
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.380]   which happens to be a lot of my credit card spending
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.620]   this year, and I'd say it was pretty optimal using it
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.880]   because 98% of the points I earned on that card
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.660]   were in those 4X bonus point categories.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.920]   Obviously, I'd love to have it at 100, but 98's pretty good.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.080]   Next up is the Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.260]   which is my primary travel card,
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.300]   but also gets used for dining when I forget to bring my Amex
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.220]   or in the rare case Amex isn't accepted.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.100]   And I did slightly worse here,
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.180]   only getting 92% of my spending in the bonus category,
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.980]   so need to work on that a little.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:43.300]   The reserve annual fee is 550 versus the preferred at 95,
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.900]   but if you deduct 300 for the easy-to-use travel credit,
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.200]   then at 250, you're paying an extra $155 for the reserve.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.980]   So if you value chase points at one and a half cents,
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.740]   then you probably need to be spending at least $10,000
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.300]   on travel to make it worth earning three points on travel
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.460]   instead of 2X on the preferred.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.180]   For me, the trip to Paris and London at the end of the year
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.900]   put me just over that threshold, but it was close.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.580]   Third up is the Chase Amazon Prime Visa.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.880]   I don't even wanna think about how much we spent on Amazon
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.480]   and Amazon Fresh this year, but I can tell you
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.940]   that the 5% back was definitely enough
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.260]   to make it worth having this no annual fee card.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.780]   Not to mention that for this one,
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.300]   we hit 100% on keeping spend
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.820]   only to the 5% back categories,
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.500]   but that's easy because it's all on Amazon.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.980]   Now, I'm not usually a cash back person,
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.780]   but when it's 5% cash back versus 2X points,
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.500]   I'll take the 5% all day as long as the spending is enough,
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.520]   which unfortunately was definitely the case
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.060]   for Amazon this year.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.420]   There are a handful of other cards
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.020]   that offer similar cash back on other categories,
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.460]   but they're usually either categories
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.180]   like travel, dining, or groceries,
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.180]   where I can get three to four points,
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.620]   or categories like gas or streaming service,
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.480]   where I just don't spend enough to make it worth the effort.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.280]   And finally, what probably should have been the first,
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.100]   but is easier to explain at the end,
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.840]   is the Capital One Venture X,
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.020]   which is the de facto card for everything
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.620]   not in one of the categories I mentioned above.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.160]   And it happens to be the only card
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.060]   I actually carry everywhere,
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.480]   if you don't include Apple Pay,
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.380]   which lets me carry all the cards.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.920]   Building up some Capital One points
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.620]   was certainly beneficial because I was able to use them
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.380]   to transfer to Turkish Air and get an amazing deal
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.660]   back home from London this year.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.360]   Also, Amy and I actually both opened up a Venture X
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.020]   this year to get the signup bonus,
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.460]   and we were trying to decide whether we keep it open.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.340]   While the $395 annual fee is steep,
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.860]   if you just look at the $300 travel credit
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.140]   and the 10,000 point annual bonus,
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.800]   it's kind of a wash, so it's probably worth keeping open,
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.940]   but the travel credit does require booking in the portal,
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.580]   so it's a little bit of work.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.460]   That said, as I was recording this,
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.940]   I realized that to avoid the annual fee,
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.660]   you either need to downgrade before the fee posts,
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.260]   which is too late for us,
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.540]   or cancel a card without downgrading,
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.700]   which I don't wanna do.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.580]   So I actually think we'll probably just keep it open
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.640]   for another year, which is fine, giving the credits.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.560]   So those are my top four cards this year.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.620]   I still use the Amex Platinum for booking flights,
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.620]   Bonvoy and Hilton cards if we stay at those hotels,
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.860]   and my Chase Freedom if any of our spend
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.900]   falls in one of their quarterly 5X point categories,
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.060]   but those are all such a tiny fraction of our spend
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.540]   that I didn't include them.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.420]   And on the business side, the majority of my spend
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.540]   is either on the Chase Inc Business Preferred
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.780]   for business travel or the Capital One Spark Cash Plus card,
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.060]   which while it's marketed as a 2% cash back card,
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.020]   is actually a 2X points card
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.380]   if you also have a miles earning card with Capital One.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.940]   And if you're interested in any of those cards,
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.700]   or really any cards at all,
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:48.180]   please consider signing up for them at allthehacks.com/cards
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.780]   where every signup helps me and the show out.
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.420]   Assuming it's the same offer you find elsewhere online,
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.260]   it shouldn't cost you a thing.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.420]   That said, one, please do not sign up for a card
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.620]   just to help me out.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.940]   It's only if you're already signing up.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.700]   And two, if you do find a better bonus somewhere,
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.740]   which while rare, may happen if you have a targeted mailer
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.180]   or referral offer, by all means,
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.100]   optimize for getting the most points you can.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.420]   That is it for this final episode of 2022.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.940]   I cannot believe how far all the hacks has come this year.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.060]   And even more, I can't believe that it's now my full-time job.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.980]   It is such an honor and a privilege
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.900]   to get to do this for you all each week.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.980]   So thank you so much for listening
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.020]   and supporting me and the show.
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.180]   I hope your 2022 comes to an incredible end.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:40.300]   And I am so excited for everything that lies ahead in 2023.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.100]   Happy New Year to you and all of your families.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.060]   I will see you next week.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.180]   Oh, and if you wanna help push a bad review
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.260]   further down the list,
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.460]   I would love a quick positive review on Apple Podcasts.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.300]   Thanks so much.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.620]   (birds chirping)
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:08.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
