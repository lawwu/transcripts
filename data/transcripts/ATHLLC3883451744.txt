[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.760]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.560]   First off, happy holidays to everyone.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.200]   And if you're new, I'm Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.100]   and I'm excited to have you here.
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.680]   Each week, you'll normally hear me talking to an expert
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.520]   about how they became world-class
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.880]   at optimizing an aspect of their life,
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.200]   or doing a deep dive myself on a topic I've been researching,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.480]   or maybe just answering your questions,
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.360]   which by the way, I will be doing next week,
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.200]   so please send some in.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.760]   But given that it's the last episode of the year,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.600]   I wanted to do something different and a little special.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.400]   I wanna recap the 10 biggest takeaways and learnings
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.940]   I've had from the past 94 episodes,
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.880]   and the ones that I'm gonna be focusing on
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.400]   in my own life in the year ahead.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.720]   After that, I'm gonna share some of my top hacks
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.480]   from the year, as well as my favorite credit cards
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.060]   from 2022, based on my actual spending data.
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.860]   So, let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.500]   Do you all remember episode 122,
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.820]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.980]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.980]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.940]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.380]   I'll admit, I was a skeptic at first,
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.220]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.860]   from Anyday, I am a total convert,
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.960]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.260]   for this episode.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.300]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.560]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.900]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code,
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.900]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.540]   The cookware is 100% plastic-free,
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.480]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.640]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.860]   freezer, and oven safe, too.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.480]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.660]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.960]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.300]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.360]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday,
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.480]   or use the code HACKS15 at checkout.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.000]   Okay, so I wanted to do these takeaways in order,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.400]   but someone managed to trick Amex Travel
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.720]   into putting $5,000 of flights on my credit card,
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.620]   so I just spent the last few hours
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.960]   trying to get my funds back,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.600]   which it turns out will be easy,
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.720]   but also to make sure the scammers' return flights,
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.220]   which happen to leave tonight, are canceled.
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.560]   As all this plays out, I'll definitely share more,
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.040]   but given that I can see the full United info,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.800]   David Weaverling and Ethan Butler,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.720]   good luck getting back to Pittsburgh tonight,
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.680]   because your return flight was canceled.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.160]   So while I didn't get to put these in a perfect priority,
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.000]   I did save my top two for last.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.160]   But takeaway number one is all about time.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.700]   I've talked to a handful of people
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.880]   about time management and productivity,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.520]   but the story that's really stuck in my head the most
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.440]   is from Laura Vanderkam in episode seven,
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.640]   where we talked about time management.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.160]   To illustrate the point that we should stop saying,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.940]   "I don't have time,"
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.080]   she talked about what would happen
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.080]   if your water heater started flooding,
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.440]   and the three to four hours
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.360]   that would magically free up in your day
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.220]   so you could deal with the issue.
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.320]   Ever since that episode,
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.600]   I've been trying to catch myself
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.280]   from saying, "I don't have time,"
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.640]   and start realizing that if I don't have time,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.320]   I'm either overcommitting
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   or probably poorly prioritizing my day.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.680]   I won't say that I've become a true expert here,
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.240]   but I'm getting a lot better,
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.960]   and I'm really excited to focus on this next year.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.800]   A few of the things that have been helpful for me
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.360]   are doing a calendar audit,
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.000]   which involved trying to be more diligent
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.580]   about tracking what I'm doing
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.360]   so that I could really review how I spent my time.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.800]   Even if it's just for a week,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.840]   it is so helpful to see how you actually spend
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.440]   the 168 hours you have each week.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.680]   The other thing I've been working on
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.400]   came from a great reminder
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.440]   from Brandon Turner in episode 82.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.240]   He discussed how important it is
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.840]   to learn to drop the right balls and establish boundaries.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.740]   Since then, I've been getting much better about saying no
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.880]   to meetings that I don't wanna prioritize
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.180]   and taking my time to follow up on things
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.900]   that really aren't at the top of the priority list.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.560]   One other tactic I've been trying
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.980]   is asking people to send me questions
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.440]   instead of schedule meetings.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.760]   And I've suggested that they use a tool called Loom
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.560]   to record the conversation.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.240]   That way, one, I can respond asynchronously on my own time,
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.120]   and two, I can actually speed up the video to 2X.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.040]   The third side benefit is that actually
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.000]   this forces some people to just give up
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.880]   and not actually try to schedule a meeting.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.920]   So that's a tactic I've been using.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.880]   I know that some of this prioritization
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.340]   means that some of you listening
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.840]   didn't get a reply to me as fast as I used to,
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.640]   but I'm working on finding a good balance
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.360]   and I still plan to reply to everyone.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.660]   Also, I just recorded an episode a couple of days ago
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.760]   that'll come out on January 18th with Dan Martell,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.560]   who has a book coming out called "Buy Back Your Time."
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.400]   And it gave me so many good ideas
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.040]   on how I can be more intentional
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.720]   about spending my money as a trade-off for time in 2023.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.640]   So to summarize takeaway one is that I have plenty of time.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.820]   I just need to get better about prioritizing it
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.200]   and saying no to things that are less important.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.780]   Also, if you notice me mentioning
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.780]   all of the past episodes by number,
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.980]   like number seven with Laura Vanderkam,
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.720]   that's to make it really easy for you guys to go find them.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.220]   Either by scrolling through the feed
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.180]   in the app you're listening to this podcast right now,
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.660]   or if you go to allthehacks.com/7 or any episode number,
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.740]   it'll take you directly to the show notes page
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.380]   for that episode, and the links on that page,
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.300]   at least the ones for Apple, Spotify, and Google Podcasts,
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.660]   should open exactly to that episode in the player app.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.740]   Okay, my second big takeaway is all about automating
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.780]   and simplifying your finances.
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.220]   It came up in episode 42 with Ben Carlson,
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.260]   19 with Andy Ratcliffe, but the first thing I'll share
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.980]   is from Ramit Sethi in episode nine.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.660]   He shared his money rules and I loved it.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.540]   For him, there are things like never question
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.180]   spending money on books, appetizers, health,
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.100]   or donating to a friend's charity fundraiser,
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.260]   and always have one year of emergency funds in cash.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.060]   The idea of coming up with a few rules
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.500]   to simplify some financial decisions is so awesome.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.700]   He also has one for business class on flights over four hours
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.740]   which I think just takes away the headache
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.460]   of trying to make a decision about when to upgrade.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.980]   Though for me, four hours or any number of hours
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.900]   is probably not worth spending the dollars
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.740]   on business class, but if I can do it for points,
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.060]   I definitely will.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.020]   Amy and I actually had a conversation about this
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.300]   and we started putting a few rules together.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.700]   One of the ones we have is discuss any purchase
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.100]   over $200 with each other, but I really wanna put together
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.260]   a more complete list next year that's more like
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.020]   the 10 rules Ramit has that I'll also link to
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.940]   in the show notes.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.220]   Another big thing for me was trying to simplify my finances.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.720]   For the past five to six years,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.140]   I've been building consumer finance apps
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.300]   which has led me to open different banking
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.340]   and investment accounts at so many different institutions.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.740]   But I realized that having my money spread out
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.980]   across so many different places made the whole process
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.500]   of money management more stressful than it needed to be.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.060]   Fortunately, my investments were easy
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.980]   because I'd already moved pretty much everything
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.440]   to Wealthfront and I have no plans to take it out
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.500]   now that I've left as an employee.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.880]   I'm really happy to pay their nominal fee
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.220]   for software to manage my investments
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.380]   and my tax loss harvesting and rebalancing
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.500]   far more efficiently than I can,
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.900]   not to mention the peace of mind
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.240]   of just not having to think about it.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.100]   So going into 2023, my goal is to get as simple as I can.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.480]   Ideally, we have just one checking account,
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.680]   one high yield cash account, one brokerage account,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.260]   and then hopefully we can consolidate
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.660]   all our retirement accounts into four.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.200]   Two for each 401k where we roll over
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.960]   all our past employers 401ks into those and two Roth IRAs.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.560]   And while that might seem like a lot,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.840]   I think at one point we had at least two dozen
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.120]   checking, savings, brokerage and retirement accounts
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.560]   all with a balance in them.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.280]   Then when it comes to saving each month,
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.280]   I'm really excited for the simplicity
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.560]   to make it even easier to automate.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.200]   I spent so much time at Wealthfront
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.880]   building a product called Autopilot
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.720]   because I really think that the easiest way
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.800]   to manage your finances is to just automate things.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.340]   With Autopilot, you can say leave this much in checking,
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.240]   keep this much in an emergency fund
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.500]   and move any excess to a series of accounts
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.600]   that you can set caps on like your IRA, your 529
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.820]   or just your taxable brokerage account.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.080]   If you wanna check out Wealthfront,
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.360]   you should use my link at allthehacks.com/wealthfront.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.040]   It'll be so nice to have everything simplified next year,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.400]   but even nicer if we can set up those money rules
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.480]   and make our financial decision making easier too.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.960]   My next big learning was all about negotiating.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.840]   Episode 17 with Kwame Christian
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.100]   who runs the American Negotiation Institute
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.640]   really was a masterclass in negotiation.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.160]   So I won't recap the whole episode,
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.660]   but one big takeaway is that negotiating
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.200]   can really be thought of as all about asking better questions
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.520]   and that those better questions
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.020]   will lead to a better result.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.400]   So before you enter any negotiation,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.200]   take the time to ask yourself what you want and why,
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.800]   ask yourself what the other side wants and why,
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.220]   and then write down all the open-ended questions
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.720]   you could possibly ask in the conversation.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.160]   Doing those three things is usually the best prep
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.520]   you can do for any negotiation.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.840]   I also loved hearing Kwame's compassionate curiosity
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.600]   framework that he uses for every negotiation.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.480]   It starts with acknowledging and validating
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.840]   the other side's feelings and emotions,
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.780]   then getting curious with compassion
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.480]   and asking them questions,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.680]   which ultimately allows you to productively
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.220]   joint problem solve to a resolution.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.040]   Now that I'm running a business full-time,
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.880]   I imagine I'll be much more involved
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.120]   in negotiations next year,
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.100]   so I'm excited to put some of this knowledge to work.
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.260]   Though I've actually been using
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.080]   the compassionate curiosity framework
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.360]   to negotiate with my two-year-old recently,
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.240]   and I've had some decent success.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.520]   The other really important negotiation tactic I learned
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.200]   was from Andy Ratcliffe,
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.800]   who co-founded Wealthfront and Benchmark Capital,
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.360]   which for those who don't know,
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.280]   was probably the most successful
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.480]   venture capital firm of all time.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.280]   And in episode 19, he shared the tactic he uses
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.960]   for every negotiation,
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.860]   which is to put the gun in the other person's hand,
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.420]   and if they fire, don't work with them.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.060]   He explained that most people don't want to be thought of
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.080]   as taking advantage of others, and it works so well,
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.120]   and for the very small percentage of people
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.560]   that always ask for something well in excess of fair,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.300]   you just walk away from negotiating with them.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.140]   So hopefully some of those lessons
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.120]   can help you negotiate next year,
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.080]   though definitely go back to episode 17
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.720]   if you want to go deeper on this.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.380]   For number four, I want to talk about regret.
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.800]   It turns out I had at least three episodes
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.080]   that either in part or in whole were about regret.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.800]   First, I talked to Ben Nimton in episode 37
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.360]   about bucket lists,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.800]   but his whole journey began after he learned
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.240]   that more than 75% of people at the end of their lives
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.840]   regret not living life on their own terms.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.100]   And while we've all heard people say they have no regrets,
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.020]   I learned in an amazing conversation
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.280]   with best-selling author Dan Pink in episode 40
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.980]   that regret is one of the most instructive emotions we have.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.720]   Naturally, every functioning person has regrets,
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.840]   and they're an essential part of our cognitive machinery.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.960]   We talked about the four kinds of regret
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.360]   and how to manage them towards your own future happiness.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.780]   For example, one of the biggest buckets of regret
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.120]   are regrets of boldness, not taking that bold action.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.880]   And Dan said the simple hack for preventing that
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   is when you're trying to make a bold decision for yourself,
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.960]   stop framing it as what you're doing
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.640]   and ask yourself what you would advise a friend to do
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.980]   and act according to your advice.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.160]   Finally, if you want to go deeper about regrets
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.860]   and start thinking about living a more purposeful life,
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.840]   definitely take a listen to my conversation
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.280]   with Jordan Grumman in episode 74,
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.440]   who happens to be a hospice doctor
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.280]   and personal finance writer.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.320]   So he brought a fascinating perspective
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.920]   on how purpose, identity, and connection
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.180]   can be so much more important in life than money.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.280]   So what does all this mean for life and 2023?
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.600]   Well, I think in the same way that I want to be intentional
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.560]   with how I spend the hours of the day,
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.880]   I want to be intentional with big things too,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.520]   the way our family spends time together,
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.520]   the trips we take, the friends we hang out with,
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.720]   and a lot more.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.620]   So Amy and I are really gonna spend some time
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.520]   over the next few weeks
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.340]   talking about what we want in our lives next year.
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.920]   I use Daffy to organize all my giving
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.080]   and charitable tax savings in one place,
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.940]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.160]   Daffy is a new modern way to give
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.720]   that makes it so much easier
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.760]   to maximize your charitable deductions,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.920]   especially before the December 31st deadline.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.880]   They do that by helping you set up a donor advised fund,
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.560]   or DAF, which is a tax advantaged account
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.680]   that lets you contribute cash or assets now,
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.560]   qualify for the tax deduction in 2022,
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.680]   and then gives you time and flexibility
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.520]   in distributing the money to the charities who need it.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.040]   I love using Daffy because it makes it so easy
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.840]   to put money aside for charity,
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.920]   and my favorite part is that it lets you be more strategic
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.060]   with your giving and your tax planning
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.920]   by having a single source of charitable deductions.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.000]   Plus, you don't have to deal with the hassle
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.440]   of tracking receipts from your donations.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.720]   To make all your tax deductible donations
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.940]   before year end in one place,
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.820]   go to allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.200]   Plus, for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.420]   you can get a free $25 to give
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.080]   to the charity of your choice.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.800]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/DAFFY.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.780]   I wanna tell you all about the most amazing way
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.160]   to buy a second home,
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.200]   and I know because we actually bought one
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.040]   for 1/8th the cost.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.160]   And don't worry, I'm not talking timeshares.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.800]   I'm talking about Picasso,
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.320]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.280]   So how does it work?
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.660]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.140]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.120]   creates an LLC for each home,
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.180]   and you can buy as little as 1/8th of the property.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.500]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.420]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:03.420]   handling design, cleaning, bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.340]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.620]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.300]   When we found Picasso, it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.420]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.360]   we toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.800]   Since then, it's truly become our second home,
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.500]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.700]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.100]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.380]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.560]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.920]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.160]   For a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.240]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.780]   where our listeners will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.440]   which means you can see new listings
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.240]   before they go on the website,
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.320]   and get up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso, P-A-C-A-S-O.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.600]   And on the topic of my relationship with Amy,
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.380]   takeaway number five is that we should all strive
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.480]   for an 80-80 marriage, at least those of us
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.440]   who are in a committed relationship.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.200]   When I spoke with Nate and Kaylee Klemp in episode 43,
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.720]   it was fascinating to talk about how relationships
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.960]   have evolved from a traditional 80-20 relationship
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.840]   decades ago, where one partner, usually the woman,
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.960]   did all the work in the relationship and for the family,
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.760]   because the other was the breadwinner.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.880]   As things evolved, we got to a place more like 50-50,
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.920]   which is I think where most of us are today.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.100]   Well, except for maybe those
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.080]   who already listened to episode 43.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.200]   But the challenge with 50-50 is that so many couples
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.400]   end up keeping score of who's done more dishes
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.800]   or spent more time budgeting or done more kids' bedtimes.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.640]   And that kind of competition can be exhausting
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.360]   and certainly doesn't make for a better relationship.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.840]   So after hundreds of interviews with couples,
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.080]   Nate and Kaylee coined the concept of an 80-80 marriage,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.440]   where both partners assumed each other are doing the best
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.380]   and tried to pull more than 50% of the weight.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.860]   It takes time and practice to get it to work,
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.220]   but I can say that it's certainly been a welcome change
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.560]   for our relationship.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.680]   In fact, I recently went back and re-listened to episode 43
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.560]   so I could brush up in advance of 2023,
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.040]   because my relationship with Amy
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.200]   is something I really wanna focus on more now
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.840]   that we have two kids to manage every day as well.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.800]   And that episode had some great tactics
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.040]   for putting the concept of an 80-80 marriage into place.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.400]   My sixth takeaway is short,
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.520]   but it's something I bring up all the time.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.920]   And it's from an episode I've listened to multiple times.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.600]   In fact, I've actually re-watched it on YouTube
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.480]   because I think the video adds a lot to the story.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.840]   That's episode 46 with Vanessa Van Edwards,
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.360]   and it's all about mastering the secret language
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.600]   of charismatic communication.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.680]   I knew the first time I heard Vanessa explain her formula
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.800]   for charisma that I had to bring her on the podcast.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.640]   In the episode, she shared so many great tactics
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.300]   for implementing the right balance of warmth and competence
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.320]   that I use almost every day.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.520]   For example, knowing that lots of emojis
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.920]   and exclamation points, both of which I use a lot,
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.360]   can drive a warmth, I either try to tone them down
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.280]   or maybe balance them out in an email
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.800]   where it makes sense to share some data or charts
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.480]   to increase my perceived competence.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.680]   Anyways, I won't recap the whole episode,
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.600]   but if your life or work relies on communicating with others,
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.880]   which I'm guessing it does,
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.600]   you should definitely check it out.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.440]   And as much as I love talking about points and miles,
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.800]   I wasn't actually sure that there would be anything
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.200]   in this episode that made it to my top 10,
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.560]   but as I reflected on the year, I was wrong.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.560]   I spent so much time trying to optimize
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.800]   for getting the most dollar per point value
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.760]   that I've been doing myself a huge disservice.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.760]   In fact, while I know I'm very fortunate
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.000]   to have millions of points and miles,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.520]   I'm actually realizing I should probably be more embarrassed
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.920]   that I'm not using them enough.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.240]   There've been plenty of times that I opted to pay for flights
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.920]   with cash instead of using points
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.280]   because it wasn't the most optimal redemption,
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.880]   even if it was a good one.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.040]   Well, in episode 89, Tiffany Funk,
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.160]   who's overseen one of the biggest travel and points sites
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.240]   on the internet for over a decade,
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.360]   really helped me put things in perspective
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.880]   and form this takeaway number seven.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.640]   Not only did she remind me
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.280]   that you don't always need to get the perfect deal,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.120]   but she busted a lot of myths I'd been adhering to
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.840]   about when to use your points.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.920]   For example, it's long been talked about
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.200]   that the best use of points
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.600]   is on international business class flights,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.480]   but she pointed out that there have been a lot
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.000]   of great domestic redemptions in the past few years as well.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.760]   So needless to say, in 2023,
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.200]   I hope we start burning down our points balance
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.600]   and stop searching for the perfect deal.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.440]   Though let's be real, that'll be very hard,
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.920]   and I'm sure I'll still be searching
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.080]   for the perfect deal too.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.560]   I hope I can just get comfortable
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.480]   taking a less perfect deal as well.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.680]   So stay tuned.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.360]   Okay, number eight is a bit of a work in progress.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.040]   In episode 85, I talked with Tiago Forte
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.880]   about building a second brain,
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.640]   and it was such a great episode
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.860]   that inspired me to change a lot of the ways
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.640]   I save and consume information.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.280]   For example, I'm now saving so much of the content
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.320]   I find online to a Read Later app called Matter,
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.660]   which saves me time for three reasons.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.280]   First, I can batch together all my information consumption.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.840]   Second, they do a great job at text to speech,
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.200]   so I can actually listen to those long Atlantic articles
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.080]   instead of needing to read them.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.440]   But third, and maybe most importantly,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.880]   at least 50% of the things I save
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.480]   lose their importance by the time
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.960]   I actually come back to them,
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.220]   which means that article that might have interrupted my day
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.340]   for 10 or 15 minutes is something I never end up reading,
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.900]   which is obviously a massive time saver.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.900]   But a Read Later app is just one of the ways
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.020]   I wanna get more serious
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.280]   about how I organize my digital life in 2023.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.820]   I think with a little bit of intention and organization,
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.380]   especially when it comes to notes and tasks,
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.580]   I can really step things up next year,
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.480]   and I'm fairly certain I'll be re-listening
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.460]   to that episode in a few weeks because it was so good.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.120]   Okay, I said I was gonna save my two favorites for last,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.980]   and while it's really impossible to call any two lessons
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.780]   or takeaways my top two,
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.340]   as I thought about all the learnings from the past year,
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.680]   there are two that really stood out.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.220]   First was absolutely one of my biggest takeaways,
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.440]   and it's that I need to spend more time
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.660]   focusing on net fulfillment instead of net worth.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.460]   If you all listened to episode 91
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.040]   with Bill Perkins a few weeks ago,
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.020]   you already know what I'm talking about,
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.140]   and if you didn't, I am tempted to say,
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.860]   just stop this episode now and go listen.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.760]   I've already re-listened to it twice
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.680]   and have lost count of the number of people
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.500]   who said it was their number one episode.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.020]   For the past 10 years,
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.700]   I feel like I've gotten caught up
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.860]   in so many of the various aspects of the FIRE movement,
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.980]   which for those unfamiliar
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.180]   is financial independence, retire early,
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.220]   and it's led me to be very frugal and save a lot
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.340]   and focus on building my net worth,
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.560]   and I'm fortunate for all that savings,
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.780]   but I also worry that there were times,
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.700]   especially before we had kids,
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.700]   now that that chapter is closed,
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.460]   where we opted to save instead of spend money
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.640]   on things that would have had a big increase
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.280]   in our fulfillment in life
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.100]   and where the memories of that experience
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.200]   would pay dividends for years to come.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.040]   I'm not saying anyone should be fiscally irresponsible
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.720]   or live at $0 in their bank account,
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   but I just wanna reframe the whole perspective
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.880]   on money and saving towards one
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.440]   where we wanna find the right way
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.920]   to allocate our money across the entirety of our lives
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.080]   so that we end up at or close to zero when it's all done,
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.280]   and this new perspective is one
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.740]   that I absolutely wasn't thinking about a few months ago,
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.220]   so what have I started doing differently?
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.180]   One, Amy and I are gonna start thinking
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.460]   about what experiences we wanna have
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.080]   over the next few years,
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.100]   both from the perspective
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.940]   that it's our last years in our 30s,
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.900]   but also that our kids will never be this young again.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.980]   Two, I wanna try to ensure we can harvest the dividends
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.620]   of the memories we create,
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.020]   so I'm gonna be more intentional
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.540]   about trying to make sure we take photos and videos
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.380]   as we have experiences in life.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.580]   Third, I'm really gonna start making decisions
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.320]   to try to maximize fulfillment.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.520]   We just did that with a trip to Europe,
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.440]   and while it wasn't the most perfect use of miles and points
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.320]   and there weren't any hotel deals we could book,
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.760]   we did it because we just knew it was an experience
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.360]   we wanted to have at this point in our life.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.840]   I'm sure there are so many more ways
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.280]   this will impact me in my life,
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.240]   and I will probably re-listen to that episode
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.660]   every few months,
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.960]   but it's one of my top learnings this year,
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.920]   and if you missed it,
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.760]   definitely scroll back to episode 91
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.600]   with Bill Perkins and enjoy.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.380]   And finally, my takeaway number 10 is all about happiness,
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.980]   and it stemmed from episode 46
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.620]   with best-selling author Arthur Brooks.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.140]   That episode was so good, I re-listened to it this morning,
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.620]   and I already have it queued up
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.660]   to listen again later this week,
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.840]   except I need to slow it down so I can take some notes.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.880]   So the first part of this takeaway
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.220]   is about how to define happiness,
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.660]   but instead of restating Brooks,
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.660]   I'll just play a clip here.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.460]   Happiness is a combination of three.
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.380]   You might say they're macronutrients.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.780]   You need enjoyment, you need satisfaction,
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.180]   and you need purpose.
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.540]   When I meet somebody who's not happy,
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.420]   I start looking diagnostically at these three things.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.020]   The first practical takeaway
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.940]   that comes from all this theory
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.860]   is that if somebody's like,
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.000]   ah, my life isn't complete,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.260]   some things are good, some things aren't,
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.260]   but I'm not really happy,
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.820]   it means there's a lack of balance in one of these things.
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.020]   Either you don't have enough enjoyment in your life,
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.940]   or you're actually not hitting goals,
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.740]   which means you don't have satisfaction,
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.620]   or you don't have a sense of purpose
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.800]   and direction in your life.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.540]   It's one of those three things.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.740]   And so that's the first place to start looking
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.500]   if you feel like you're not where you wanna be
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.820]   in terms of your happiness.
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.720]   - That was such a great lesson for me,
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.540]   but just learning what happiness is isn't enough.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.460]   We also talked about how to impact it.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.060]   And one of the biggest learnings I had
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.380]   came from understanding
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.060]   our fluid and crystallized intelligence curves.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.620]   And for some quick context,
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.640]   fluid intelligence is your ability
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.900]   to process new information, learn, and solve problems,
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.340]   while crystallized intelligence is your stored knowledge
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.380]   that you've accumulated over the years.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.900]   The big takeaway was that in our 20s and 30s,
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.140]   our fluid intelligence curve is at its peak,
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.340]   and we can rely and really thrive with it.
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.960]   But as we move into our 40s and older,
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.380]   the tides start to shift,
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.780]   and our crystallized intelligence or wisdom starts to form,
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.820]   and realizing that and finding work that can harness it
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.940]   is really the key to happiness with our work
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.800]   for the next few decades.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.380]   While it may seem obvious to some,
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.220]   it really helped me start to think about
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.860]   what I should be doing professionally
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.580]   and the next chapter of life.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.420]   And funny enough,
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.700]   I think transitioning to all the hacks full-time
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.660]   is really a reflection of wanting to shift
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.880]   and make a jump onto that crystallized intelligence curve.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.960]   Honestly, I could keep going on this episode.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.500]   We talked about how journaling
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.980]   can be one of the most valuable habits
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.280]   to start doing each day,
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.580]   which is something I'm gonna try to start doing next year.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.500]   And beyond journaling,
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.100]   we talked about the four things
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.080]   that you need to focus on each day.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.380]   And I'll just play another clip
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.460]   instead of trying to say it myself.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.620]   If you wanna be among the happiest people,
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.400]   they all do these things every day.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.840]   They practice their faith or life philosophy.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.060]   You don't have to be religious.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.280]   You just have something bigger than you
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.020]   that zooms you out on your own life.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.840]   Life philosophy or faith or a spiritual practice
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.240]   gives you that uniquely.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.480]   So it's meditation or prayer or studying the Stoics,
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.620]   whatever it happens to be,
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.140]   you gotta do your thing and you gotta do it seriously.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.180]   Second is family.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.380]   The ties that bind and don't break.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.400]   It's important that you not choose them,
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.220]   but that you have them for your happiness.
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.380]   And God knows in many cases, we wouldn't choose them.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.580]   The third is friendship.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.580]   We have a major loneliness crisis in the United States.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.260]   The average number of close friends
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.940]   that somebody 30 years old has,
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.460]   has been cut in half in the past 20 years.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.920]   About half of people under 30
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.460]   say that no one knows them well.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.600]   It's horrible for every aspect of happiness.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.720]   And part of the reason for that
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.620]   is that everybody knows how to make deal friends,
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.820]   but we know less and less how to make real friends.
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.180]   And the last is work.
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.340]   And work doesn't mean working hard all night long.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.860]   It doesn't mean making tons of money.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:51.980]   It doesn't mean having prestige.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.780]   It means exactly two things.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.860]   Earning your success,
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.620]   meaning your skills meet your passions
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.920]   and serving other people, the people who need you.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.660]   If you earn your success and you're serving other people,
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.580]   I don't care if you're an electrician or a librarian
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.180]   or a podcast host or a Harvard professor,
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.300]   you will be happy from your work.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.780]   And if you don't have those things,
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.260]   you won't be happy from your work.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.460]   Faith, family, friends, and work are the big four.
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.740]   So I could keep going,
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.740]   but instead you should just go back
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.340]   and listen to episode 47 with Arthur Brooks.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.860]   It is chocked full of great advice and tactics
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.820]   to be happier in 2023.
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.220]   And I for one am going to be putting a lot of that
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.040]   into action next year.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.420]   All right, it was so hard
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.920]   to try to narrow everything I've learned
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.460]   down to just 10 things.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.780]   And unfortunately there were so many great things
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.860]   that didn't make the cut.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.660]   Since I'm not working at a company anymore,
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.700]   I left off a few episodes from this list
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.620]   because they're not big takeaways for me right now.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.540]   But if you are working for a company
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.360]   and especially in a leadership role,
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.100]   you should definitely go check out three episodes,
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.540]   number 39 with submarine commander, David Marquet,
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.340]   number 57 with Navy SEAL commander, Mike Hayes,
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.260]   and number 90 with product builder extraordinaire,
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.660]   Lenny Ruchitsky.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.540]   But if you think that there's an important takeaway
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.660]   or lesson that I missed,
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.960]   I would love to hear from you
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.380]   because I'm always curious what you think.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.740]   But that's enough lessons and takeaways for now.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.860]   Let's also talk about the best hacks from 2022.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:17.300]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.800]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.380]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.820]   in your situation,
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.420]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.700]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.540]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.700]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.220]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.220]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.620]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.620]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.900]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.060]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.400]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.120]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.940]   are first-generation wealth,
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.020]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.140]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.500]   and learn from each other
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.100]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.380]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.700]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.120]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.260]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.260]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.740]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.180]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.820]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.280]   So many of these conversations
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.500]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:28.180]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.020]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.100]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.260]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.520]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.900]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.860]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.940]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:51.180]   This holiday season, I wanna give gifts to my loved ones
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.180]   that make them feel special and unique,
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.500]   just like the relationships we share.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.740]   If you feel the same way,
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.460]   you should be giving them StoryWorth,
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.940]   which is an incredible gift
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.700]   I've given to the people I care about,
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.020]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.820]   StoryWorth is an online service
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.540]   that helps you and your loved ones preserve
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.560]   precious memories and stories for years to come.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.480]   It's a thoughtful and meaningful gift
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.780]   that connects you to those who matter most.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.540]   Each week, StoryWorth emails your relative or friend
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.780]   a thought-provoking question of your choice
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.820]   from a vast pool of options.
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.660]   Each unique prompt asks a question
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.940]   you've never thought about,
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.940]   like what's the bravest thing you've ever done,
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.740]   or if you could see into the future,
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.820]   what would you want to find out?
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.980]   After a year, StoryWorth will compile
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.580]   all of your loved one's stories,
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.660]   including photos, into a beautiful keepsake book
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.420]   that you'll be able to share and revisit
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.880]   for generations to come,
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.340]   which, now that we have kids,
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.660]   I couldn't be more excited
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.340]   to start collecting these books to share with them.
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.340]   Reading the weekly stories helps connect you
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.700]   with loved ones no matter how near or far apart you are,
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.060]   and you'll be surprised at the things you learn,
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.620]   like how my dad might have gotten into trouble
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.340]   for landing a helicopter at Denny's
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.140]   back when he was in the military.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.700]   With StoryWorth, I'm giving those I love most
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.780]   a thoughtful, personal gift from the heart
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.740]   and preserving their memories and stories
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.140]   for years to come.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.300]   Go to allthehacks.com/storyworth

[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.420]   Coming in at number one has to be the hack
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.300]   that's resulted in the most emails from you all,
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.260]   which is booking a hotel directly and emailing them
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.300]   to tell them you're excited to stay.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.340]   Big thanks to Lee Rowan for sharing it in episode one,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.320]   and Julia Menez for sharing it alongside a template
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.060]   for doing it in episode 55.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.160]   I've heard from over 100 listeners about using this hack
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.980]   to get upgrades, bottles of wine, free food,
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.620]   vouchers for drinks at the bar, free parking,
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.380]   and maybe most ridiculously,
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.220]   pillows embroidered with initials on them.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.500]   So I hope that this hack continues
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.780]   to bring you upgrades and more in 2023.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.060]   And if you're new and want more details about it,
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.820]   definitely go back and listen to episode one or episode 55.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.140]   Next is probably the second most popular hack
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.380]   I've heard from listeners about,
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.860]   and that's finding free unclaimed money
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.240]   that you're owed on your state's unclaimed money website.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.840]   I think the biggest winner was a listener
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.920]   who found over $1,000 for her and her family,
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.880]   but I've had dozens of people find over $100
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.740]   and countless people who found at least $20.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.480]   So if you haven't checked yourself, definitely do that.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.980]   And if you're with friends or family
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.640]   for the last few days of the year,
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.800]   and you can look them up and surprise them at dinner
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.560]   with free money, then surely that would make
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.380]   a great holiday gift for them.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.900]   So two more travel hacks that have been awesome.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.960]   One, taking the main photo from a vacation rental
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.480]   on Airbnb or VRBO and doing a reverse image search
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.880]   to find it on other and probably more cheaper sites.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.820]   This one is great.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.400]   I did use this tactic in Paris and found an alternative site
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.000]   to book a place we were considering for 20% less.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.900]   Big shout out to Lee Rowan for sharing that
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.600]   all the way back in episode one,
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.580]   which is still the all time most popular episode
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.120]   in this podcast and definitely worth the listen
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.680]   if you like travel hacks.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.800]   Two, for rental cars, AutoSlash has saved me
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.640]   and countless listeners hundreds of dollars.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.960]   I actually interviewed the CEO, Jonathan, in episode 66,
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.320]   and I think it was effectively a masterclass
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.240]   on getting deals on car rentals.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   So before you book your next rental car,
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.680]   or even if you already made a reservation,
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.460]   at a minimum, check out AutoSlash,
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.840]   but probably go back and listen to all of episode 66.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.280]   Okay, this next hack is one I used earlier today,
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.780]   and it's a trick I learned from Nir Eyal in episode 25,
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.380]   where we talked about distraction
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.180]   and how you can become indistractable.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.760]   For me, it was a hack for saying no
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.560]   to delicious unhealthy food in the house.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.440]   The trick is not to say no,
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.960]   but to give yourself permission to have it in five minutes.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.160]   By then, you've almost always moved on to something else
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.120]   and have lost your craving,
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.540]   and this morning it resulted in me eating
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.040]   at least one or two less molasses cookies,
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.420]   which I will call a win.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.480]   Continuing on the health side are two hacks from my episode
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.680]   with the host of the Healthier Together podcast, Liz Moody.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.440]   First is taping your mouth shut at night.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.920]   It sounded crazy to me
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.760]   and probably took six months to actually try it,
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.200]   but I am sold.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.840]   The team at Hostage Tape sent me their mouth tape
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.920]   a few weeks ago, and I've been using it almost every night.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.240]   I feel like I breathe better
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.080]   and my mouth doesn't get as dry at night.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.000]   The second is cold showers.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.620]   I did it for 30 days straight, but I will be honest,
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.780]   I haven't been as consistent since.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.460]   However, I wanna get this trend back up again in 2023
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.540]   because when you start your day with a cold shower
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.620]   or a cold plunge, I just feel like anything else
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.740]   that comes your way is so much more manageable.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.000]   Another hack on the health side
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.260]   is that you should never pay
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.980]   the first healthcare bill you get,
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.160]   and that's for so many reasons that I learned
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.580]   when I fractured my foot and got shingles
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.460]   all in a few months.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.220]   Thanks to reporter Marshall Allen,
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.220]   who actually wrote the book on fighting back
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.860]   against medical bills and winning,
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.860]   who joined me on episode 34,
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.640]   I was armed with the knowledge I needed
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.740]   to save thousands of dollars.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.780]   I was amazed at the inaccuracies
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.020]   of some of these medical bills
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.100]   that I took the time to review.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.660]   It was crazy that just by pushing back,
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.460]   I got my insurance to cover bills
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.140]   that they wouldn't cover at first.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.860]   And the most wild thing was that some of the bills
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.340]   you get in the mail aren't actually bills.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.180]   I'm not kidding.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.940]   It is perfectly legal for someone to send you a letter
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.300]   that looks like a bill,
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.340]   but is actually just a request
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.100]   that if you wanna pay them the extra
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.340]   beyond what your insurance company has paid them, you can.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.240]   That happened for me with a $300 medical boot
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.020]   that my insurance only covered for $75,
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.880]   and the letter I received made it seem
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.340]   like I owed the difference,
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.540]   but the reality was I didn't owe anything at all.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.180]   It is all a total racket,
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.660]   and if you wanna learn more
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.820]   or get help fighting back on any of your medical bills,
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.620]   either check out episode 34
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.020]   or just reach out directly to Marshall Allen.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.580]   He loves helping people in these situations.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.160]   So not quite health-related,
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.700]   but definitely a brain hack is for remembering things.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.700]   If you already know how to build a memory palace,
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.500]   then you can skip ahead a few seconds,
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.980]   but it was so fascinating
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.300]   to talk to two-time world memory champion,
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.280]   Johannes Mallow in episode 30
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.700]   about the tactics he uses to memorize everything
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.220]   from lists to names to numbers,
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.900]   and they're all skills he taught himself later in life,
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.380]   so you can easily pick them up too.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.040]   That episode was so fun and a bit interactive,
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.880]   so I hope you enjoy it.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.380]   And finally, my last hack to share today
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.420]   is a fun one from Nick Gray,
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.140]   and it's to stop inviting people over for dinner
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.560]   and start hosting cocktail parties.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.180]   It's so much easier.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.260]   You don't need food.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.620]   You can put a two-hour hard stop on the event
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.660]   and kick people out.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.440]   It lets you spend time with more people in a shorter window,
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.020]   and all around is just more fun.
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.140]   While my all-the-hacks event in San Francisco
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.900]   probably bent the rules for an easy cocktail party,
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.900]   it was so fun, and I look forward to doing more events
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.340]   and cocktail parties in 2023,
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.300]   so definitely check out episode 68 with Nick Gray
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.480]   to hear about his formula for the perfect cocktail party.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.180]   All right, there were obviously so many more hacks
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.620]   than I included above, so if you want more,
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.640]   there's almost 100 episodes of this show to go listen to
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.020]   and a few dozen newsletters that you can check out
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.060]   at allthehacks.com/email.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.740]   But to wrap up this episode,
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.500]   I wanted to run through my top credit cards for 2022.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.300]   I looked at my spending summary for the year,
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.580]   and it was really dominated by four cards
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.340]   that have become my main four for non-business expenses.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.660]   First is the Amex Gold, which is my dining/grocery card,
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.980]   which happens to be a lot of my credit card spending
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.240]   this year, and I'd say it was pretty optimal using it
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.480]   because 98% of the points I earned on that card
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.260]   were in those 4x bonus point categories.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.540]   Obviously, I'd love to have it at 100, but 98's pretty good.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.700]   Next up is the Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.860]   which is my primary travel card,
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.900]   but also gets used for dining when I forget to bring my Amex
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.820]   or in the rare case Amex isn't accepted.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.100]   And I did slightly worse here, only getting 92%
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.780]   of my spending in the bonus category,
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.580]   so need to work on that a little.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:34.900]   The reserve annual fee is 550 versus the preferred at 95,
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.500]   but if you deduct 300 for the easy-to-use travel credit,
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.820]   then at 250, you're paying an extra $155 for the reserve.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.580]   So if you value Chase points at 1 1/2 cents,
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.900]   then you probably need to be spending
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.260]   at least $10,000 on travel to make it worth
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.900]   earning three points on travel
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.060]   instead of 2x on the preferred.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.780]   For me, the trip to Paris and London at the end of the year
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.500]   put me just over that threshold, but it was close.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.180]   Third up is the Chase Amazon Prime Visa.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.480]   I don't even wanna think about how much we spent on Amazon
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.100]   and Amazon Fresh this year, but I can tell you
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.540]   that the 5% back was definitely enough
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.860]   to make it worth having this no-annual fee card.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.380]   Not to mention that for this one,
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.920]   we hit 100% on keeping spend
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.420]   only to the 5% back categories,
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.100]   but that's easy because it's all on Amazon.
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.580]   Now, I'm not usually a cash back person,
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.380]   but when it's 5% cash back versus 2x points,
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:30.100]   I'll take the 5% all day as long as the spending is enough,
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.120]   which unfortunately was definitely the case
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.660]   for Amazon this year.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.020]   There are a handful of other cards
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.620]   that offer similar cash back on other categories,
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.060]   but they're usually either categories
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.780]   like travel, dining, or groceries
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.780]   where I can get three to four points,
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.220]   or categories like gas or streaming service
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.080]   where I just don't spend enough to make it worth the effort.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.880]   And finally, what probably should have been the first
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.700]   but is easier to explain at the end
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.440]   is the Capital One Venture X,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.620]   which is the de facto card for everything
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.220]   not in one of the categories I mentioned above,
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.760]   and it happens to be the only card
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.660]   I actually carry everywhere,
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.100]   if you don't include Apple Pay,
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.980]   which lets me carry all the cards.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.520]   Building up some Capital One points
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.240]   was certainly beneficial because I was able to use them
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.980]   to transfer to Turgoshare and get an amazing deal
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.280]   back home from London this year.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.980]   Also, Amy and I actually both opened up a Venture X
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.620]   this year to get the signup bonus,
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.080]   and we were trying to decide whether we keep it open.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.940]   While the $395 annual fee is steep,
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.460]   if you just look at the $300 travel credit
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:31.180]   and the 10,000 point annual bonus, it's kind of a wash,
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.420]   so it's probably worth keeping open,
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.540]   but the travel credit does require booking in the portal,
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.180]   so it's a little bit of work.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.080]   That said, as I was recording this,
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.580]   I realized that to avoid the annual fee,
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.300]   you either need to downgrade before the fee posts,
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.900]   which is too late for us,
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.180]   or cancel a card without downgrading,
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.340]   which I don't wanna do,
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.220]   so I actually think we'll probably just keep it open
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.280]   for another year, which is fine, giving the credits.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.220]   So those are my top four cards this year.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.260]   I still use the Amex Platinum for booking flights,
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.260]   Bonvoy and Hilton cards if we stay at those hotels,
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.500]   and my Chase Freedom if any of our spend
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.540]   falls in one of their quarterly 5X point categories,
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.700]   but those are all such a tiny fraction of our spend
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.180]   that I didn't include them,
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.060]   and on the business side, the majority of my spend
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.200]   is either on the Chase Inc Business Preferred
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.440]   for business travel, or the Capital One Spark Cash Plus card,
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.700]   which while it's marketed as a 2% cash back card,
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.660]   is actually a 2X points card
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.020]   if you also have a miles earning card with Capital One,
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.580]   and if you're interested in any of those cards,
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.360]   or really any cards at all,
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.140]   please consider signing up for them
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.820]   at allthehacks.com/cards,
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.420]   where every signup helps me and the show out,
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.060]   assuming it's the same offer you find elsewhere online,
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.900]   it shouldn't cost you a thing.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.060]   That said, one, please do not sign up for a card
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.580]   just to help me out, it's only if you're already signing up,
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.360]   and two, if you do find a better bonus somewhere,
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.400]   which while rare, may happen if you have a targeted mailer
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.820]   or referral offer, by all means,
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.120]   optimize for getting the most points you can.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.980]   That is it for this final episode of 2022.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.500]   I cannot believe how far all the hacks has come this year,
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.220]   and even more, I can't believe
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.640]   that it's now my full-time job.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.560]   It is such an honor and a privilege
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.480]   to get to do this for you all each week,
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.540]   so thank you so much for listening
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.580]   and supporting me and the show.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.740]   I hope your 2022 comes to an incredible end,
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:31.860]   and I am so excited for everything that lies ahead in 2023.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.660]   Happy New Year to you and all of your families,
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.660]   I will see you next week.
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.760]   Oh, and if you wanna help push a bad review
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.840]   further down the list,
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.040]   I would love a quick positive review on Apple Podcasts.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:44.880]   Thanks so much.
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.400]   (whooshing)
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.740]   [BIRDS CHIRPING]
