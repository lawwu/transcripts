[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Alright, we got a question now from Mika,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   who asks, "What time tracking granularity
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   would you recommend?" 30 minutes.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   I think the smallest granularity with which you want to do any time
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   block planning is 30 minutes. Once you're below 30 minutes,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   you should just batch whatever you're doing into a collection of activities
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   that takes 30 minutes. Once you get below 30 minutes,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   you're getting too fine grained. There's no way that you're actually going to hit those blocks consistently.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   What's the point? So this is why you'll see in my time block planner,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   for example, 30 minutes is the smallest granularity that I've demarcated
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   for actually drawing out time blocks, and that's the way to do it.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Quick technical tip for accomplishing that,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   because if you're time blocking on a planner, that 30 minute
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   block might be small, physically small, right? It doesn't take up much space.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   So if you're putting five small things into a 30 minute block, you're probably
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   not going to be able to record those five things in a
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   30 minute size block in your time block planner.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   So the advice I give in the front of the planner, where I have a sort of mini dissertation
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   on time block planning, is you instead put a number in that
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   30 minute block. Put a number 1 and circle it. And then in the upper
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   right of your time block planning grid, you draw the 1 up there, and then right
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   next to it you can have the list of everything that's supposed to go in that block. Oh, here's the
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   five things. 1, 2, 3. And you put it up in the upper right of your time block grid
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   because your time block plan, even as you correct it as time goes on,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   gets lower and lower and lower. It looks like a downwards facing slope.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   So the upper right of your time block grid is unlikely to actually be
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   space that you need for corrected time block plans. So you put it up there
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   and so you can elaborate a lot of little things
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   that are supposed to happen in a small block. So don't go less than 30 minutes, just put more
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   into those 30 minute blocks.
