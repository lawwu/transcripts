[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.060]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.860]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.380]   Today, my guest is Dr. Kyle Gillette.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.580]   Dr. Gillette is dual board certified in family medicine
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.980]   and obesity medicine,
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.540]   and practices out of a clinic in Kansas
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.460]   and via telemedicine.
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.460]   He provides full spectrum medicine,
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.220]   including hormone health, preventative medicine,
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.700]   obstetrics, which is the branch of medicine and surgery
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.020]   concerned with childbirth
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.300]   and the care of women giving birth, and pediatrics.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.580]   I first learned about Dr. Gillette from a podcast
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.220]   of all things, and was immediately struck
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.860]   by the breadth and depth of his knowledge
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.660]   on all things hormones and hormone optimization.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.540]   As you'll see very soon today,
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.100]   Dr. Gillette can teach you how to optimize your hormones
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.300]   using behavioral tools, nutrition, exercise-based tools,
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.980]   supplementation, and hormone therapies
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.820]   if those are appropriate for you.
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.100]   There are many professionals out there,
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.060]   including many medical doctors, of course,
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.100]   talking about hormone health.
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.980]   What really sets Dr. Gillette apart from the pack
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.720]   is his ability to understand how the different factors
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.100]   that I described before, nutrition, supplementation,
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740]   exercise, and hormone therapies,
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.920]   how those interact with one another,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.300]   and the safest and most rational ways
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.580]   to approach hormone optimization.
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.540]   During today's episode,
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.840]   you will learn how to optimize your hormones,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.640]   not just testosterone and estrogen,
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.220]   but also prolactin and other hormone pathways
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.300]   that impact your mood, mental health, and physical health.
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.480]   Dr. Gillette is also an avid educator
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.660]   about hormones and other aspects of health.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.700]   He does this on zero-cost-to-consumer platforms,
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.800]   such as Instagram and other social media.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.860]   On Instagram, he is @KyleJilletteMD.
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.860]   That's K-Y-L-E-G-I-L-L-E-T-T, no E at the end, MD.
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.860]   So @KyleJilletteMD on Instagram,
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.820]   and he is @JilletteHealth on all other platforms,
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.600]   including LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.400]   If you go to his Instagram or his other social media,
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.600]   you will learn a lot about hormone health,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.300]   about the latest science impacting obesity
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.520]   and metabolic health.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.880]   He is a wealth of knowledge.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.120]   And again, he's providing all that information
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.280]   at zero cost to you, the consumer.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.200]   What you are soon to hear is a conversation
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.440]   between me and Dr. Gillette about all things hormones
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.020]   and hormone health and hormone optimization.
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.080]   We dive deep into mechanisms,
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.360]   but we are clear to establish what each word
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.420]   or set of concepts mean.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.240]   So if you have no background in biology,
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.700]   or even if you do, I'm sure that you'll come away
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.400]   with a wealth of valuable knowledge.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.640]   We also talk about specific protocols related, again,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.320]   to lifestyle factors, nutrition, supplementation,
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.960]   and where appropriate, hormone replacement therapy.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.320]   I know there's a lot of interest about these topics.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.680]   Dr. Gillette is very thorough about addressing
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.760]   both male and female issues
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.700]   and addressing hormone health
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.100]   for people at all stages of life.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.720]   I'm sure that you will come away from this episode
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.500]   with the same impression that I did,
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.700]   which is that Dr. Gillette
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.120]   is an extraordinarily clear communicator
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.900]   and that he has tremendous compassion for his patients
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.160]   and that he has a deep love of understanding biology
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.800]   and medicine in ways that can benefit you.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.200]   I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.020]   in May, 2022.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.880]   The first live event will take place in Seattle, Washington
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.300]   on May 17th.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.060]   The second live event will take place in Portland, Oregon
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.380]   on May 18th.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.760]   Both are part of a lecture series
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.740]   entitled The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.180]   during which I will talk about science
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.560]   and science-based tools,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.720]   many of which overlap with the topics covered
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.320]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.240]   but most of which will not
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.500]   and will be completely new topics and tools
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.280]   never discussed publicly before.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.960]   Both live events will also include
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.720]   a question and answer period
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.120]   during which you, the audience,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.880]   can ask me questions directly
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.720]   about any aspect of science or science-based tools,
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.720]   and I will attempt to answer them.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.020]   Tickets for the two events,
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.160]   again, Seattle on May 17th and Portland on May 18th,
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.100]   are both available at HubermanLab.com/tour.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.680]   Before we begin with today's episode,
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.400]   I want to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.340]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.600]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.280]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.940]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.040]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.800]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.840]   Our first sponsor is Thesis.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.720]   Thesis makes nootropics.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.160]   In fact, they make custom nootropics.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.320]   Now, what is a nootropic?
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.160]   Technically, nootropic means smart drug.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.820]   Frankly, I'm not a big fan of the word nootropics
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.560]   because what is smart?
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.640]   I mean, there's creativity, there's focus,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.880]   there's task switching,
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.760]   different aspects of our brain and body
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.720]   engage different aspects of cognition,
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.320]   many of which we can call smart.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.680]   There's emotional intelligence,
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.060]   there's analytic intelligence,
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.820]   there's logic, there's creativity.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.820]   Thesis understands this and has designed custom nootropics
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.580]   designed to bring your body and brain
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.120]   into the specific state that you want.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.960]   So for instance,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   they have specific nootropics for creativity,
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.040]   other nootropics for focus,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.520]   other nootropics for motivation and so on and so forth.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.700]   In addition to that,
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.940]   each nootropic is custom designed for you.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.900]   They use only the highest quality ingredients,
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.580]   things like alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine,
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.000]   which I've talked about on this podcast before.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.060]   They also use ingredients like ginkgo biloba,
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.040]   which many people use, like and benefit from.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.120]   However, there are also people like me
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.560]   who can't take ginkgo biloba
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.180]   because it gives me terrible headaches.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.440]   I learned that a long time ago
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.520]   and so I simply can't take any nootropic
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.940]   or any supplement for that matter
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.040]   that includes ginkgo biloba.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.380]   I'm sure I'm not alone in the fact
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.140]   that some ingredients work for me and others do not.
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.360]   Thesis has solved this problem of individual variation
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.280]   by creating a brief quiz.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.760]   So if you go online to takethesis.com/huberman
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.500]   and take a three minute quiz,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.180]   and then Thesis will send you to four different formulas
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.700]   that match your specific preferences.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.140]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.580]   And if you use the code Huberman,
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.900]   you'll get 10% off your first box of custom nootropics.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.780]   Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.300]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.060]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.660]   to help you better understand your body
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.660]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.560]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.800]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.100]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.040]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.800]   There are a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.020]   but a major issue with many of them
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.780]   is that you get numbers back about levels of hormones,
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.780]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.840]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.860]   InsideTracker has solved that problem
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.260]   by creating a personalized dashboard.
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.800]   So you take your blood and or your DNA test,
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.160]   you get the results back
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.940]   and where certain values might be too high
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.960]   or too low for your preference,
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.260]   you can click on that
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.180]   and it will direct you immediately to lifestyle factors,
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.900]   nutrition and supplementation, et cetera,
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.940]   that can help you bring those numbers back
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.300]   into the ranges that are ideal for you.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.940]   So it not only gives you information
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.540]   about where your health stands,
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.860]   it gives you directives as to how to improve your health.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.420]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.180]   go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.100]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.920]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.700]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.720]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.200]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.840]   I spent a lifetime studying the visual system.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.300]   I can tell you that your visual system
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.660]   is incredibly sophisticated.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.340]   It allows you to do things like move
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.220]   from a shady area outside to a sunny area outside
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.160]   and to adjust your visual system
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.060]   so you don't even notice that transition.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.900]   A lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses are not designed
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.620]   with those sorts of biological transitions in mind.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.200]   Roka sunglasses and eyeglasses are different.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.080]   Every one of their glasses is designed
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.380]   with the biology of the visual system in mind.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.980]   First of all, they're incredibly lightweight,
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.940]   so you don't even notice that they're on your face.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.140]   Second of all, they were designed to be worn
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.660]   during activities like running and cycling, et cetera,
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.180]   and they won't slip off your face even if you get sweaty,
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.460]   and they have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.880]   So even though they were originally designed
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.380]   as active eyewear, they look great.
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.580]   So you can wear them out to dinner,
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.300]   to school, at work, et cetera.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.620]   If you'd like to try Roka sunglasses or eyeglasses,
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.300]   you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.740]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% on your first order.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.140]   Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.320]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.280]   And now for my discussion about hormone health
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.340]   and optimization with Dr. Kyle Gillette.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.340]   Dr. Gillette, welcome.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.760]   - Thank you for having me.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.860]   - Well, I'm super excited to talk to you
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.100]   because I found out about you on a podcast,
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.780]   and it immediately became clear
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.300]   that you are an encyclopedia of knowledge
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.460]   about hormone health for men and for women
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.580]   across the lifespan.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.860]   So I have many, many questions,
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.180]   but before we dive into those questions,
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.780]   I'd love to just get a little bit of your background
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.740]   in terms of your medical training
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.340]   and what your particular orientation is
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.840]   toward treating your patients.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.180]   And how do you think about this whole landscape
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.300]   that we call hormone health?
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.780]   What is a hormone?
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.860]   How do you envision people managing their hormones?
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.880]   If you could just kind of fill in a few of those blanks
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.300]   for us, I think a lot of people would appreciate it.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.180]   - Absolutely.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.000]   So I'm dual board certified in family medicine
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.300]   and obesity medicine.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.220]   I've kind of tailored my training
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.740]   in order to provide what I call a balanced approach
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.240]   to total health, which includes body, mind, and soul.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.620]   I recently saw a podcast with Joe Rogan and Mr. Beast,
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.160]   and Joe asks, Mr. Beast,
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.180]   how do you become such an amazing YouTuber
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.320]   and have all these great clickbait videos?
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.940]   And how did you become good at it?
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.820]   And it turns out he just became obsessed
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.380]   when he was a teenager.
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.100]   And that's essentially how I've tailored my education
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.940]   as well.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.060]   I've become obsessed with optimal human performance,
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.220]   their body, their mind, and even their spirit.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.620]   So I attended med school at the University of Kansas,
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.220]   which is one of the few med schools
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.860]   that still emphasizes full spectrum care.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.620]   They emphasize exercise as medicine.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.660]   They emphasize food as medicine,
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.360]   of which I was active in both of those interest groups.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.500]   In residency, I was active
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.740]   in a lot of mindfulness curriculum,
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.160]   and then also things like walk with a doc,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.340]   where you emphasize preventative medicine.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.260]   That's something that we've kind of got away from,
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.660]   and that niche led me to hormone health.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.660]   It didn't really start as hormone health,
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.680]   but it's a very important component of health in general
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.780]   that many people don't emphasize.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.520]   - Great.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.640]   Well, this idea of preventative medicine, I think,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.020]   is starting to really take hold in the general population,
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.260]   especially given the events of the last few years.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.660]   People realize that they are showing up to health challenges
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.880]   at a bunch of different levels,
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.960]   and with some people feeling very robust,
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.060]   other people feeling back on their heels.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.600]   When someone comes to you as a patient,
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.100]   what are some of the first things
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.680]   that you want to know about them?
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.940]   I mean, obviously you want to know their blood pressure,
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.500]   you want to know something about their mental health
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.160]   and family history, but in terms of hormone health,
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.580]   what are the sorts of probe questions that you ask,
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.960]   and what are you looking for?
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.940]   And I ask this because I'd like people to be able to ask
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.040]   some of these very same questions for themselves.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.580]   - Yeah.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.020]   So when you do a physical exam and a history,
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.500]   you have a lot of different parts.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.100]   You have your history of present illness,
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.140]   if they have a complaint.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.580]   Maybe the patient doesn't have a complaint.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.780]   In that case, things like their social history
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.780]   and their family history are extremely important
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.820]   because that gives you an insight into their genetics
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.400]   and an insight into their hormone health.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.200]   So patients will tell me, "Oh, I'm doing okay,"
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.220]   but it helps to ask them, "Well, how are you now?"
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.340]   Let's say the patient is 50.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.900]   "How are you now versus when you were 20,
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.920]   "and what has changed?"
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.420]   So I've gotten the question a lot,
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.580]   how do you get your doctor to order a better lab workup
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.700]   or to even include your basic hormones?
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.540]   And there's no magic answer to that.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.180]   But what really helps is you tell them,
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.100]   my energy is not as good as it used to be.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.020]   My focus is not as good as it used to be.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.160]   My athletic performance is not as good as it used to be.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.200]   So you don't have to have a pathology
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.020]   in order for a lab to be indicated.
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.540]   You just need to have that pertinent symptom.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.760]   - I think that's gonna be really helpful
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.180]   because for many people,
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.180]   the idea of getting a blood test to look at their hormones
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.620]   just seems like such an enormous hurdle to get over.
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.920]   And many doctors won't prescribe them.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.560]   And would you say that it's using the approach
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.360]   you just described that it's equally effective
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.480]   for men and women,
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.940]   or do you find that for one reason or another,
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.400]   that men and women have different challenges
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.460]   and advantages in trying to access
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.240]   their deeper hormone data?
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.760]   - Yeah, it's slightly different.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.660]   With women, there's a lot more objective data.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.360]   So if they're having menstrual irregularities,
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.600]   or if they're not having a period,
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.560]   if they're having too heavy of periods,
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.960]   then those are things that they talk about
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.920]   very frequently with their doctor.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.480]   Men are more hesitant.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.880]   So men really wanna know what their testosterone is,
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.420]   but at the same time,
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.960]   they really don't wanna tell their doctor
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.100]   how their libido is or how their energy is,
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.560]   because it's almost like they feel less masculine
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.240]   or they feel less like a guy when they say that,
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.740]   even if they're just talking to their doctor about it.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.840]   - Yeah, I think that that raises a really important point,
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.600]   which is that the whole discussion around hormone health
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.920]   is a bit of a barbed wire topic,
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.200]   because in many ways, when we hear the word hormone,
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.860]   we think testosterone and estrogen,
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.920]   we think notions of masculinity and femininity,
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.440]   and of course, testosterone and estrogen
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.300]   are present in all sexes, right?
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.120]   All chromosomal backgrounds,
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.560]   and just to varying degrees and ratios.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.000]   But it also raises all these issues about sexual health
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.560]   that it's kind of interesting
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.480]   'cause I'm surrounded by medical doctors
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.000]   in my lab at Stanford.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.840]   And the more physicians that I surround myself with,
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.320]   the more open is the discussion around sexual health
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.620]   and reproductive health.
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.860]   But in the general population,
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.320]   I think some of these topics are a little bit taboo
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.740]   or again, it's kind of barbed wire.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.960]   And so I think that people are seeking
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.640]   a lot of this information on YouTube
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.480]   and through communities that may or may not be very educated
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.280]   about the actual biology.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.880]   So along those lines,
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.200]   we could probably assume that hormones
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.560]   are changing across the lifespan, I think, right?
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.000]   Certainly from childhood and puberty and onward.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.760]   If you would, I'd love to just kind of take a snapshot
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.680]   of what you think everybody should be thinking about
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.280]   or doing to optimize their hormone health,
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.640]   male or female, in the, let's say in their 20s.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.120]   And then maybe we could migrate that
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.480]   to their 30s and 40s.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.640]   But before that, could you just tell us
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.520]   what everyone should be doing for their hormone health
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.280]   from puberty onward?
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.260]   - Yeah, the law of diminishing returns applies.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.800]   So doing a little amount of what I call
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.880]   lifestyle interventions over a long period of time
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.400]   is gonna be far more helpful or efficacious
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.640]   than doing a lot and then doing nothing
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.880]   or doing a lot and then doing nothing.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.800]   So I talk about the big six pillars.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.640]   The two strongest ones are likely diet and exercise.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.560]   For hormone health, specifically resistance training
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.900]   is particularly helpful.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.900]   For diet, caloric restriction can be particularly helpful,
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.280]   especially with the epidemic of metabolic syndrome
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   that is continuing to on go in this country
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.000]   and in developed countries in general.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.020]   So those are the two most powerful.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.760]   So number one and number two are diet and exercise.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.280]   For the last four, I have a little bit of alliteration.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.160]   So there's stress and stress optimization
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.580]   that has to do with cortisol,
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.320]   that has to do with your mental health,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.120]   that has to do with societal health
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.940]   and collective health of your family as well.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.880]   When you're a member of a family
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.380]   or even a very close friend,
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:03.340]   trying to achieve optimal health together is very important.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.080]   It's the same thing with nicotine cessation,
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.920]   same thing with hormone optimization.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.760]   If you do it as a household unit, it's far more helpful.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.080]   So after stress, you have sleep optimization.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.200]   Sleep is extremely important,
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.960]   especially for mitochondrial health as well.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.360]   And then you have sunlight,
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.600]   which encompasses anything that's outdoors.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.420]   So you move more, you have cold exposure,
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.760]   you have heat exposure, that's sunlight.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.680]   And then the last one is spirit.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.520]   So that's kind of the body, mind and soul.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.460]   If you have all the other five and they're dialed in
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.000]   completely, but you don't have your spiritual health,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.200]   whatever you believe,
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.840]   then that's going to profoundly impact your body
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.920]   and your mind as well.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.680]   - And we're definitely gonna touch into this notion
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.780]   of spiritual health, because I think for some people
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.160]   that might draw connotations of certain things
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.480]   that may or may not be accurate,
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.080]   but I know a number of academic laboratories
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.440]   that are focused on this and a number of,
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.200]   not just functional medicine clinics,
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.560]   but research clinics and hospitals throughout the country
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.920]   that are achieving some really interesting data,
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.460]   not just in people that are quite sick,
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.140]   but in healthy people who are trying
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.280]   to further optimize health.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.160]   So we will definitely touch back to that.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.580]   If you would be so kind as to maybe give us
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.800]   a little bit more detail about some of these other areas.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.960]   So when people hear diet, I immediately think, okay,
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.080]   now we get into the combat around vegan,
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.000]   plant-based, carnivore, et cetera.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.040]   But I think that my general view of this
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.160]   is that most people should probably be eating
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.080]   as few highly processed foods,
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.600]   highly palatable foods as possible,
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.740]   which doesn't mean eating foods
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.820]   that don't taste good, of course.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.120]   But what other sorts of things do you recommend
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.240]   in the realm of diet?
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.400]   And then I also want to know about caloric restriction,
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.900]   because my understanding is that a caloric surplus
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.220]   can actually support certain hormones like testosterone.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.400]   So how does one combine caloric restriction
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.420]   and still optimize hormones?
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.720]   But what would you say is a really terrific way
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.800]   to think about and approach diet?
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.040]   - Yeah, diet should be an individualized approach.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.560]   So if you have a car, each car is made different
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.360]   and requires a different sort of fuel,
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.000]   whether it's a race car, whether it's a diesel truck,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.220]   they have different fuels
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.840]   for different performance outcomes.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.160]   So if you're trying to tow something
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.920]   or you're trying to go fast.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.580]   So it's the same way with athletes.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.620]   It's pretty well studied.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.080]   The more intra-workout carbs
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.920]   ultra long distance athletes take,
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920]   in general, they do better.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.080]   I think they've studied this in cyclists quite often.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.020]   It also depends on your genetics.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.240]   So you can have a genetic polymorphism
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.500]   and you metabolize carbs and sugar better,
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.280]   even when they're unopposed by fiber.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.680]   - How does one determine whether or not
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.700]   they have such a polymorphism?
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.140]   I mean, I'm an omnivore,
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.580]   so I do eat some high quality meats, not in huge quantities,
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.960]   but I also eat vegetables and starches, I feel fine.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.400]   I've never done an elimination diet.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.700]   I think I did a very low carb diet once
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.400]   and all it gave me was a lot of psoriasis and poor sleep.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.000]   So I backed off, I probably didn't do it correctly,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.920]   but I know a lot of people that do quite well
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.560]   on a very low carb or zero carb diet.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.200]   - Yeah, particularly those who are at risk of cancer
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.920]   because you have less glucose
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.240]   that can be easily uptaken into cells.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.160]   And then also people with autoimmune diseases.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.360]   - They tend to do well on-
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.560]   - On lower carb diets, yeah.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.420]   But yeah, as far as the, how do you know?
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.680]   Basically you can use your biofeedback,
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.320]   how you're feeling to guess what you tolerate well,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.400]   or you can just get genetic testing,
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.880]   which can be fairly expensive,
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.000]   but most of all, it requires a physician
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.040]   or someone who knows how to interpret the test accurately.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.080]   - And if someone had the means,
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.920]   would you say that getting regular blood testing
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.740]   is a good idea?
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.600]   And if so, what is regular blood testing?
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.500]   Is it every three months?
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.800]   Is it every six months?
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.320]   Of course, the backdrop of life is changing too,
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.920]   stress levels, et cetera.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.240]   - Yeah, every three to six months for preventative purposes.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.580]   At times, you need blood tests at faster frequencies
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.920]   than that.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.080]   And then you should also get a blood test
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.560]   when you're fasting and when you're not fasting.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.620]   So if you're looking for damage to the beach,
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.640]   you wanna, you don't just look at low tide,
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.520]   you look at high tide
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.720]   and you see what's happening at high tide as well.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.960]   - That's a great way to put it.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.380]   And in terms of general recommendations around exercise,
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.320]   I mean, I'm of the mind based on the data that I've seen
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.480]   that almost everybody should,
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.800]   or everybody should be getting 150 to 180 minutes,
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.220]   minimum of zone two cardio per week.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.160]   That kind of could continue while having a conversation,
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.160]   but if one were to exert any more effort,
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.600]   it would have a hard time getting the words out.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.920]   At least that, right?
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.980]   For cardiovascular health and general brain health
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.080]   and musculoskeletal health plus resistance exercise.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.780]   Is that more or less the contour of what you recommend?
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.840]   - Yeah, that's more or less the contour.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   The more you're doing your zone two cardiovascular exercise,
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   the slightly less important a long duration
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.740]   of caloric restriction is.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.580]   - Interesting.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.240]   And that brings us to caloric restriction.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.320]   So it's very clear that caloric restriction
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.920]   can allow one to lose weight, right?
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.220]   This is the classic Kiko, C-I-C-O,
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.440]   calories in, calories out.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.680]   We are not disputing calories in, calories out.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.040]   Somehow that always has to be stated 50 times in any forum
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.920]   because of whatever follows.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.120]   People I think will anchor to and assume
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.940]   that we don't mean that,
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.180]   but I know you and I both agree on calories in,
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.920]   calories out as a fundamental law of thermodynamics.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.660]   But it's clear to me that based on what I've read,
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.060]   that when one is in a slight caloric surplus,
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.840]   that hormones like testosterone can be optimized,
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.120]   but is that true for somebody who's showing up
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.840]   with excessive body fat?
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.680]   How does this all work?
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.340]   Because body fat is manufacturing enzymes
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.040]   that convert testosterone to estrogen.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.480]   So in other words, how does someone know
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.420]   if they should use caloric restriction
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.960]   or avoid caloric restriction?
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.000]   - Yeah, here's how to parse that out.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.260]   So before I delve into the details a bit more,
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.080]   I should say as a board certified
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.820]   obesity medicine physician,
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.860]   obviously the laws of thermodynamics apply.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.880]   And then in addition to that,
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.340]   there is nothing special about intermittent fasting
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.760]   or caloric restriction or exercise
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.200]   when it pertains to losing body weight in general.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.240]   When you do lose weight,
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.960]   about 33% of that is lean body mass
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.820]   and about 10% of fat cells, adipose cells
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.100]   are actually lean body mass as well,
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.440]   because it has proteins and water
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.220]   and things like that in it too.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.360]   So the reason for exercise
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.420]   and the reason for caloric restriction in general,
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.260]   including intermittent fasting is health reasons.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.260]   That's how you increase your health span.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.880]   It's not necessarily gonna make the weight
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.820]   on the scale change, but that doesn't matter as much.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.180]   It's been fairly well studied in both mice and humans.
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.980]   It's much easier to study in mice.
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.540]   So that's a precursor to our six types of people,
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.940]   the ones that care about mice studies
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.060]   and the ones that care about human studies.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.620]   But if you calorically restrict mice by 40%,
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.620]   then they can have improved testosterone parameters,
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.140]   but only if they're obese to start.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.680]   And it appears to be that same way in humans as well.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.920]   So the easy way to think about it is if you're obese
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.760]   or you have metabolic syndrome,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.900]   caloric restriction will improve your testosterone.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.500]   There has been a study and they talk about all these studies
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.420]   in a systematic review from the Mayo Clinic proceedings
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.580]   in March of last year.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.580]   And they note that there is a study in young healthy men
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.740]   and they calorically restrict them
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.620]   and their testosterone does decrease.
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.040]   So if you're young and healthy
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.680]   and you don't have metabolic syndrome,
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.680]   then caloric restriction
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.440]   will likely decrease your testosterone.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.420]   - That clarifies a lot for me.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.480]   And I believe it will clarify a lot
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.780]   for other people as well.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.000]   And I'm delighted that you pointed out this distinction
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.720]   about intermittent fasting not being the only way
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.420]   to achieve caloric restriction.
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:09.420]   There are a number of young healthy or older healthy people
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.980]   I know who like using intermittent fasting,
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.380]   even if they're not trying to lose weight.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.500]   For a couple of reasons,
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.900]   some believe that it might extend lifespan.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.380]   I think that's still a bit of an open question.
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.780]   It's a bit of a hard experiment to do
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.460]   because the control group is,
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.500]   no one wants to be in the control group, as I say.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.820]   - It does in mice.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.420]   - Right, exactly. - Captain audience.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.320]   - Exactly.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.080]   And the other feature of it that's a little bit tricky
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.780]   is that many people like intermittent fasting
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.240]   because of the mental effects,
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.400]   the clarity of mind that they feel during fasting,
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.340]   the increased pleasure in eating when they finally do eat.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.540]   And here I'm referring to intermittent fasting of the sort
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.820]   where eating windows are anywhere
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.300]   from eight to 12 hours a day,
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.800]   not extended fast of 24 hours or more.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.500]   So the question therefore is for the healthy,
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.620]   lean enough person, right, non-obese person,
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.700]   is intermittent fasting a bad idea
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.400]   in terms of hormone health?
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.320]   Is oscillating between this period of kind of feast
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.940]   and famine within a 24 hours a problem
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.220]   if one is getting sufficient calories to maintain weight?
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.580]   - Yeah, so if they're in a caloric maintenance,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:21.580]   then it's not going to be deleterious.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.100]   It's not gonna be bad for their hormone health.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.300]   There's a couple of different hormones
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.120]   that we can talk about.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.660]   We can talk about testosterone.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.460]   We can talk about DHEA, which usually go hand in hand.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.420]   And then we can also talk about growth hormone,
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.900]   which is not a steroid hormone, but it's a peptide hormone.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.540]   So it's a chain of proteins, amino acids
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.100]   that are put together instead of a sterile.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.580]   Think of sterile hormones as coming from cholesterol.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.020]   So intermittent fasting, you do get a little spike
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.320]   in growth hormone after you eat,
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.220]   but you also get a huge spike in growth hormone,
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.880]   a more significant, less negligible spike overnight.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.160]   And that is improved if you are intermittent fasting.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.180]   So it's probably gonna help your growth hormone
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.100]   and subsequently IGF-1 levels,
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.300]   which will help more in older age groups
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.720]   than younger age groups.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.540]   - And I like to eat dinner.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.840]   So for me, that means sometime around six or seven o'clock,
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.900]   sometimes eight o'clock, I confessed last night,
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.480]   'cause I was working late, I ate pretty big.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.540]   It's basically my only meal of the day.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.640]   At 10 o'clock, that's a rare thing for me.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.660]   Can I still achieve a high degree of growth hormone output
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.780]   if let's say I avoid food in the two to three hours
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.160]   before going to sleep?
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.640]   Or does one have to be very deep into a fast
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.280]   in order to achieve the increase in growth hormone?
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.760]   - There's still pretty good growth hormone output,
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.900]   even if you eat two or three hours before you sleep.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.640]   It's just the law of diminishing returns.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.400]   The longer you go, you get slightly more and slightly more.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.720]   - Great.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.560]   And I know a number of people think of growth hormone
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.200]   in the context of the exogenous growth hormone
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.540]   and the fact that that can, in some cases,
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.720]   be associated with cancers.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.240]   I've been asked many times before,
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.040]   can the increase in growth hormone from things like saunas
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.600]   or intermittent fasting cause levels of growth hormone
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.600]   that are so high that they cause cancers?
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.560]   My impulse is to say, no,
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.740]   that seems like it's not likely to happen,
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.080]   but I should probably verify that statement with you.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.800]   - Yeah, so quite unlikely.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.080]   I think about growth hormone and especially IGF-1,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   and there's actually an IGF-1 and IGF-2,
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.800]   but I think about it in terms of endocrine IGF-1,
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.160]   mostly IGF-1 that's synthesized in the liver
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.760]   and released in the liver versus IGF-1 that's released.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.880]   Classically, an example of this would be
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.360]   your IGF-1 levels increase after resistance training
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.040]   or exercise, and that's more of like paracrine or autocrine,
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.600]   and they have more local action.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.740]   So that IGF-1, it's pretty well studied
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.620]   that if you just give people IGF-1,
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.520]   it's not going to, at physiologic levels,
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.400]   it's not going to improve their body composition.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.760]   However, that IGF-1 that's autocrine and paracrine
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.940]   just working in those local tissues and muscles
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.260]   is likely part of the reason why you get
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.720]   a improved body composition response after exercise.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.540]   - I see.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.680]   And just to clarify for me and for others,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.500]   what can we say are the major functions of IGF-1 and IGF-2
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.520]   that are distinct from just growth hormone?
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.880]   Are they just kind of the active form of growth hormone,
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.880]   or kind of the pickaxe end of the assembly line?
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.860]   - So they have a much longer duration of action.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.060]   I believe the half-life of IGF-1 is several days,
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.060]   almost a week, whereas growth hormone
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.680]   has an extremely fast half-life of only hours.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.800]   So growth hormone acts significantly on the liver
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.440]   to produce IGF-1.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:03.440]   So it's around in the serum in the blood long enough
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.840]   to where it's producing an effect pretty much all the time.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.080]   - Very interesting.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.760]   Well, and then your other pillars, stress.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.260]   We've talked a lot about stress on this podcast before
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.060]   and tools for managing stress.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.040]   Sleep obviously is a big one.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.580]   I think if nothing else,
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.520]   I will either put people to sleep with my podcasts,
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.820]   certainly not this one, but my solo episodes,
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.960]   or hopefully convince people that sleep is the foundation
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.040]   of mental and physical health and performance.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:36.000]   Are there any aspects of hormone optimization
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.460]   that can improve sleep?
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.120]   I know sleep can improve hormone optimization,
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.720]   but are there any aspects of hormone optimization
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.160]   that can improve sleep?
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.140]   And for people that are suffering from this common syndrome
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.560]   of going to sleep and then waking up
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.920]   at three or four in the morning,
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.600]   we know that can be associated with depression,
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.180]   but are there any hormonal indications
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.640]   that might lead to that kind of situation?
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.880]   - Yeah, there's three big ones.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.660]   The first one is not super common,
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.800]   but it's a very direct correlation.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.760]   If you have a growth hormone deficiency, a true deficiency,
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.340]   whether you're an adult or a child,
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.920]   then your sleep is likely going to be affected.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.320]   And let's say you're a child with growth hormone deficiency.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.040]   Once that is replaced with therapy,
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.740]   your sleep is gonna get significantly better.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.100]   The second one that's a very common scenario
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.400]   is if you're having what's called vasomotor symptoms
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.320]   of menopause or vasomotor symptoms of andropause,
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.780]   which are also applicable.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.400]   And that's where your progestogenic activity,
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.340]   so your main progestogens are progesterone
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.640]   and then pregnenolone,
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.780]   and then 5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone,
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.620]   which is a slight-
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.240]   - Where are those manufactured in the body?
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.480]   - So they're manufactured in a few places.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.720]   In men, they're manufactured some in the testes
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.080]   and the late egg cells.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.120]   In women, they're manufactured in the ovaries
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.620]   until menopause.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.740]   And then they're also manufactured in the adrenal glands.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:07.660]   So if you're in, if you're pre-adrenopausal,
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.620]   where your adrenal glands are still working fairly well,
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.500]   you usually still have a decent amount of progesterone around
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   and this can be measured too.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.900]   So after menopause, women make progesterone
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.620]   from their ovaries, or sorry, from their adrenal glands.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.900]   If that progesterone crosses the blood-brain barrier,
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.300]   especially if it's 5-alpha and 3-alpha reduced,
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.180]   so it's modified a little bit,
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.060]   then it is both a GABA agonist, which helps sleep,
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.820]   just like GABA does, gamma-amino-butyric acid,
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.580]   the main inhibitory neurotransmitter
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.940]   of which lots of things work on.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.740]   Alcohol works on GABA as well.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.980]   GABA, Penten also works on GABA.
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.100]   Migraine medicines, many of them work on GABA.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.780]   Benzodiazepines and also non-benzos.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.820]   So an example of a benzo would be Xanax,
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.620]   an example of a non-benzo would be Ambien.
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.340]   So those all work on GABA.
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.740]   So GABA is also helped
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.820]   by the progestogenic activity as well.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.460]   That's why a lot of women in menopause
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.860]   feel like their sleep is much worse,
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.620]   is because they have lower activity of those progestogens.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.460]   - And for men in so-called andropause,
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.660]   low testosterone, is that also one of the causes
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.220]   of poor sleep?
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.500]   - Low testosterone can lead to poor sleep,
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.020]   but my third scenario is actually,
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.180]   if a man begins TRT,
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.140]   then they develop a poor sleep because of sleep apnea.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.900]   It drastically raises the risk
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.980]   that somebody is going to have sleep apnea.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.860]   And then a lot of people,
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.100]   especially when they first started
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.540]   in the first month or two,
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.900]   it puts them into this hyper sympathetic state
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.540]   because they have overactive androgen receptors,
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.980]   especially after a long time of being hypogonadal.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.900]   Then they have a physiologic dose of TRT
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.100]   and that causes the sleep issue itself.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.580]   - Interesting.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.420]   I have a lot of questions
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.340]   about TRT, testosterone replacement therapy.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.620]   I should just mention that when you say
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.740]   it increases sympathetic activity,
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.220]   you don't mean that taking testosterone
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.780]   increases sympathy for others.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:16.980]   It may in fact do the opposite,
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.900]   although it's very clear from my discussions
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.300]   with my colleagues in the endocrinology side
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.860]   and also with the great Dr. Robert Sapolsky
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.740]   that increasing testosterone merely exacerbates
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.140]   existing features of people.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.620]   So the jerks become bigger jerks,
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.180]   kind people become even more kind in general.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.740]   But I want to get into TRT in depth,
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.340]   but it's very interesting to me to hear
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.700]   that testosterone replacement therapy
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.200]   increases the risk of sleep apnea.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.420]   And I want to make sure that I ask that,
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.540]   is that also the case in people that are using TRT
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.140]   who are not hypogonadal?
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.300]   Because in the classic situation,
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.980]   if somebody isn't making enough testosterone,
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.340]   they're below 300 nanograms per deciliter on the chart,
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.180]   they go in and take TRT.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.620]   But many people nowadays, let's be honest,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.980]   are taking doses of testosterone
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.140]   even though they are in the sort of standard range
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.620]   because the range is so large
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.220]   because of other symptomology.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.200]   Is that right?
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.160]   - Yeah.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.000]   I do love the analogy that Dr. Sapolsky had
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.220]   about monks taking testosterone
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.500]   and making them more and more generous.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.340]   So that does appear to be what testosterone usually does
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.860]   is it exacerbates, if you will, what you're previously like.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.520]   So it's not going to change you as a person.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.860]   But if you're ugonadal before you start testosterone-
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.940]   - Meaning?
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.020]   - Meaning you have normal testosterone
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:41.540]   and then you start TRT or self-administered TRT,
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.100]   steroids, however you want to look at it,
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.540]   then your risk of sleep apnea still goes up
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.140]   in a dose dependent fashion.
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.780]   So the higher the dose, the more risky.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.500]   With the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.180]   the sympathetic is the fight or flight nervous system.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.940]   The parasympathetic is the rest and digest.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.740]   So if you have too much fight or flight
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.260]   and stress can cause that too,
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.300]   then you're not going to rest as well at night.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.540]   - I want to touch on testosterone in women
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.100]   because there is testosterone in women.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.500]   I'd like to know where that testosterone comes from,
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.940]   which tissues.
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.680]   I'd like to know whether or not
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.520]   testosterone replacement therapy makes sense in women.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.300]   I'm hearing more and more about women using testosterone.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.080]   And I'd like to know whether or not
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.560]   knowing a woman's testosterone,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.860]   for her to know her testosterone is of equal,
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.860]   less than or more value than knowing, for instance,
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.280]   progesterone and estrogen levels,
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.840]   because I think there are a lot of misconceptions
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.780]   about the roles of testosterone in women.
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.220]   - For health optimization,
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.260]   testosterone is just as important to know.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.540]   For pathology prevention, for example,
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:50.600]   breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen and progesterone
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.380]   are more important to know.
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.820]   So when you're thinking about women,
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.680]   women think that they have
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.860]   such a tiny amount of testosterone because you test it.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.940]   Most people test a free testosterone.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.280]   So testosterone that's unbound,
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.880]   which is by far the smallest proportion of testosterone.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.340]   Any androgen is bound by lots of different
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.520]   steroid binding proteins,
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.560]   but the ones that are most pertinent are called SHBG
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.780]   or sex hormone binding globulin.
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.740]   And that binds the androgenic steroid,
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.580]   for example, DHT or dihydrotestosterone.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.660]   It's associated with prostate enlargement,
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.600]   associated with male pattern baldness.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.780]   It binds that the most strongly,
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.660]   and then it binds testosterone next most strongly.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.540]   And then it binds things like androstenedione
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:39.740]   or DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:44.360]   And then it binds the estrogens, the weakest, like estradiol.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.340]   So if you look at the total amount of testosterone,
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.940]   women actually have, almost all women, not all women,
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:55.940]   but almost all of them have significantly more testosterone
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.620]   than estradiol,
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.780]   but it's because it's in different measurements.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.700]   So estradiol a lot of time is, you know,
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.300]   P grams per mil as opposed to nanograms per deciliter.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.760]   So women have more testosterone than estrogen
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.100]   and significantly more DHEA than either.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.940]   - Interesting.
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.860]   Do women make dihydrotestosterone?
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.080]   - Yeah.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.500]   - And where does this testosterone come from?
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.140]   Because they don't have testes.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.660]   - Yeah, so most testosterone in women that are premenopausal
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.400]   can come from theca cells, T-H-E-C-A.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.480]   So theca cells are cells in the ovaries
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.380]   that can produce testosterone.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.060]   And a lot of people have actually heard about hyperthecosis,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.700]   not the term itself,
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.660]   but a lot of Olympians that are,
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.960]   their chromosomes are XY, they're females,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.220]   and they're not taking any-
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.780]   - Wait, they're XY, but they're females?
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.340]   - Oh, sorry, they're XX, yeah, thank you.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.300]   So they're XX, they're not XY,
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.860]   and they have never transitioned
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.580]   or been on any sort of hormone replacement or testosterone,
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.260]   but they naturally produce a huge amount of testosterone
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.100]   as much as many men.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.140]   And some of these women, I believe they were from Botswana,
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.640]   were banned from competing in the Olympics
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.440]   in certain distances.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.880]   I believe they were banned from the 400 meter and 800 meter
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.300]   because their natural testosterone was deemed to be too high.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.140]   - So they mistakenly thought that they were using steroids?
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.820]   - They actually knew they were not using steroids.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.380]   They knew it was their theca cells
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.900]   were just genetically gifted, I suppose,
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.520]   and they still made them change distances.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.880]   So one or two of these athletes changed to,
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.240]   I believe it was a 3K or the 5K,
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.860]   and they still did quite well,
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.580]   but it was not their best event.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.500]   - Interesting, yeah,
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.120]   that's turning out to be a very interesting
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.140]   and controversial area of this notion of hormone therapies
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.220]   and natural variation in hormones
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.880]   on different chromosomal backgrounds.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.860]   Fascinating, we should probably do a whole episode
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.360]   about that 'cause it's very much of the times.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:59.240]   So men and women both make DHT.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.260]   I'd like to ask about DHT in men.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.600]   So often we hear about testosterone in men
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.740]   and free testosterone being the unbound form, of course,
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:13.600]   but dihydrotestosterone, where does it come from in men?
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.400]   What is the cascade of events that takes testosterone
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.900]   to dihydrotestosterone?
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.180]   And what are some of the quote unquote
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.860]   positive and negative effects of,
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:28.180]   here I'm only referring to endogenous dihydrotestosterone.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.300]   And in fact, I'll make it very clear whether or not
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.220]   I'm talking about taking something
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.620]   or one's own natural production.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.940]   Here we're just, I think up until now
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.940]   we've just been talking about natural production.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.440]   So tell us about DHT in men,
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.700]   such a powerful hormone during development, obviously,
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.100]   but what is it doing?
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.700]   - DHT is a very androgenic hormone.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.380]   So whether you're talking about DHEA,
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.940]   which is a mild, a weak androgen,
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.420]   or testosterone, which is a relatively strong androgen,
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.300]   or DHT, which is a very strong androgen,
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.280]   they bind to the androgen receptor
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.340]   in both men and in women.
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.540]   So the effect of all three of those
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.160]   is mediated by the androgen receptor.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.900]   There's a couple of different beta estradiol receptors
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.820]   and alpha estradiol receptors,
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.300]   but there's only one androgen receptor.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.020]   Intriguingly, it is on the X chromosome.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.180]   So men get their androgen receptor gene from their mother.
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:29.720]   Women get one androgen receptor gene from their father,
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.000]   one from their mother.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.660]   Often the one that is more sensitive to androgens
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.540]   in people with PCOS, that's the one that's active.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.940]   The other one is methylated and inactive.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.060]   - Can I just pause you one second?
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.580]   Sorry to interrupt, but I have to ask this question
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.780]   before I forget.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.260]   And I know a number of people are probably wondering.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.340]   I've heard that whether or not
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.420]   one develops male pattern baldness,
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.700]   whether or not a male develops male pattern baldness,
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.200]   just to be very precise,
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.520]   you could get some information about that
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.780]   by looking at your mother's father.
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.180]   And that would be in keeping with what you just described,
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.060]   but the X chromosome,
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.620]   which of course is handed off through the mother,
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.300]   is carrying the genes that encode
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.060]   for the number and distribution
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.060]   of these androgen receptors that DHT will bind to.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.940]   'Cause of course, I think as you'll probably tell us,
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.260]   that DHT is responsible for male pattern baldness
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.080]   and beard growth.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:19.920]   Is that right?
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.980]   Should I look at my grandfather on my mother's side
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.740]   to determine what I'm likely to look like
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.000]   in terms of my DHT-ness?
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.840]   Is that a word?
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.660]   - Yeah.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.380]   It's the best guess that you can make
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.020]   purely from phenotypes.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.020]   And you can measure your genotype.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.940]   And get a better idea of that.
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.140]   Assuming that it's true male pattern baldness,
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.420]   it's related to the gene transcription
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.220]   of the androgen receptor.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.260]   So I like to think of it as
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:48.100]   how much of this androgen receptor gene
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.780]   is activated by any androgen.
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.020]   So if you have an extremely sensitive gene,
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.960]   which usually means you have very few CAG repeats,
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.420]   which is basically just a certain CAG encodes
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.180]   for a certain amino acid.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.740]   And if you have very few of the repeats,
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.460]   then your androgen receptor gene works better.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.300]   Think of it as a corollary to Huntington's disease,
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:14.260]   where if you have very few called trinucleotide repeats,
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.200]   then it's not as severe of a disease.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.140]   But after you get more and more CAG repeats,
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.540]   which by the way are in the population,
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.800]   you're getting more and more CAG repeats.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.960]   So it's a natural selection of process
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.680]   that has been ongoing for a variety of number of reasons.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.360]   But anyway, if you have more repeats,
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.040]   then that gene activates in the cytoplasm
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.360]   and moves to the nucleus
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.880]   and causes gene transcription more often
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.640]   and hair loss more often.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.360]   - Does that mean that we're seeing more hair loss now
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.980]   due to elevated levels of DHT than we were 50 years ago?
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.520]   - Probably not.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.640]   The hair loss 50 years ago,
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.960]   well, not 50 years ago, but 500 years ago
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.160]   was probably more significant
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.760]   because on average 500 years ago,
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.520]   people were more sensitive to androgens.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.360]   So there's a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome,
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:13.420]   AIS, and that syndrome was related to when men
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.640]   who have the copy from their mother who is a carrier,
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.840]   their AR gene or androgen receptor gene
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.800]   is completely insensitive.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.400]   So think of it, it doesn't have it,
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.280]   it's not related to the CAG repeats,
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:30.280]   but think of that receptor as just not working at all.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.940]   So there's a continuum.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.480]   So everybody's receptor works a little bit better
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.880]   or a little bit worse.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.080]   And the better your receptor works,
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.920]   the more likely you are to have male pattern baldness.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.080]   - To zoom out from this,
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.980]   but still keeping an eye on DHT,
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:51.980]   what do you like to see all women and all men do
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.360]   to optimize DHT?
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.280]   And here I'm talking about regardless of age.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.200]   So we're still in this from puberty onward phase.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.880]   We haven't yet micro dissected out decade by decade,
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.720]   which we will do.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.940]   But what do you like to see people do to keep DHT in check?
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.600]   But before you tell us that,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.920]   could you tell us what positive things DHT does
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.720]   when it's in the proper range?
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.440]   - Yeah, so DHT helps a lot for,
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.280]   it's the same reason why testosterone helps.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.560]   It activates the androgen receptor gene.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.500]   It helps effort feel good.
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.620]   So it can be motivating.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.220]   So that's how it's active in the CNS.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.420]   It also is active in cardiovascular tissue.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:34.640]   So if you look at someone that has heart failure,
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.400]   or if someone has cardiac hypertrophy,
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.280]   the level of DHT can matter
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.200]   because it's also binding to the androgen receptor
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.240]   in the myocardium or in the heart itself.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.640]   So you think of the classic bodybuilder heart.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.520]   That's an easy example to make.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.360]   They have very thickened muscle.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.620]   Their muscle is very strong because they're pumping blood,
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.760]   often with high blood pressure.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.660]   And that DHT and the testosterone
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.560]   and any DHT derivatives like masterone
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:08.120]   or oxandrolone, primaboulin, also bind to the heart.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.620]   And they cause even more hypertrophy
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.180]   or enlargement of that muscle tissue.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.040]   So then let's say the person stops and they're recovering
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.800]   and they're trying to have cardiac remodeling,
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.640]   which is where you take a very thick heart.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.240]   And cardiac remodeling is important
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:27.040]   in a lot of different cardiac pathologies.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.600]   But if you give them finasteride or dutasteride,
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.560]   which inhibit the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT,
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.240]   so making less activity at the androgen receptor gene,
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.240]   they have cardiac remodeling and their heart health improves.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.080]   - I see.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.280]   So for the non-bodybuilder,
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.520]   the typical woman or man or younger or older,
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:51.320]   what sorts of things support DHT and thereby heart health,
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.520]   presumably DHT is involved in some of the other things
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.280]   that testosterone is famous for in both men and women,
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.360]   things like libido, as you mentioned,
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.320]   making effort feel good.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.600]   So motivation drive and vitality is, I guess,
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.760]   could be the general phrase.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.960]   What sorts of things support DHT?
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.560]   What sorts of things create problems for DHT?
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.380]   - There's lots of dietary changes and supplementation
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.000]   that you're probably doing right now
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.560]   that's affecting your DHT.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.400]   - You mean me personally?
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.200]   Well, everybody, all of the listeners,
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:26.640]   because let's say you have a diet high in plant polyphenols.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.960]   Many of those inhibit the enzyme
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.000]   that converts testosterone to DHT.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.380]   - Could you give us an example of one of those,
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.360]   either in supplementation form or in food form?
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.760]   - Curcumin, certain curcuminoids,
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.460]   depending on the structure,
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.480]   will inhibit the enzyme called 5-alpha reductase
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.400]   that converts testosterone to DHT.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.240]   - Turmeric.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.440]   - Yeah, turmeric, black pepper extract.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.360]   So it's used often to increase bioavailability.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.500]   It's also called biopurine.
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.780]   It's also a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:04.800]   And on top of that, people have different genetics too.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.720]   So some people, there are 5-alpha reductase enzymes.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.800]   There's three of them.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.940]   They're on chromosome two, three, and four, I believe.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.380]   But some of them are active in the prostate.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.380]   Some of them are active in the brain.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.620]   And so it depends on which tissue.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.460]   They're tissue-specific enzymes
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.160]   that depend on how much DHT you convert.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.580]   - Do you recommend that people avoid curcumin and turmeric
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:29.940]   for that reason?
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.060]   And is there any specific recommendations
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.300]   for men versus women?
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.780]   - If a man or a woman, by the way, in women,
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.920]   a lot of times if you just ask your doctor for a DHT check,
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.380]   it's the same unit as in men.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.420]   So it's essentially undetectable.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.340]   So you have to, you know,
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.140]   especially if they're on oral contraceptives,
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.100]   which is a different topic,
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.700]   their DHT is very likely undetectable,
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.700]   especially if it's free DHT.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.180]   You can measure both a DHT and a free DHT.
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.480]   But if someone's DHT is already low,
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:04.220]   or if they have somewhat insensitive androgen receptor
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:07.400]   via genetics or via lifestyle,
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.140]   then I recommend they avoid bioavailable curcuminoids,
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.500]   like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract,
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.620]   and they might be a good candidate for creatine.
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.580]   Creatine, like creatine monohydrate,
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.140]   can significantly increase
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.140]   the conversion of testosterone to DHT.
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:23.980]   - Interesting.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.860]   There's also a lot of really interesting data coming out now
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:30.000]   about the role of creatine as a brain fuel
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.180]   and maybe even as a cognitive enhancer over time.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:34.160]   The data are still ongoing,
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.500]   but some of the studies in humans are pretty impressive,
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.620]   at least to me.
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:39.020]   I'm glad you mentioned this thing
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.360]   about curcumin and black pepper.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.640]   I wish we'd had this conversation six years ago
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.660]   because I had the experience of jumping on the bandwagon
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.040]   of the excitement around turmeric,
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:49.620]   and I took a turmeric supplement.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.760]   It was a couple of capsules of what I thought to be,
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.900]   and I think was high quality turmeric.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.960]   And I've never felt as poor as I did
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.580]   in the subsequent few days.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.300]   Flat line of, let's just say,
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.020]   everything that one would want to have in life,
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.500]   energy, vitality, just, it was a cliff.
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:11.120]   And a friend somehow knew
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.880]   that curcumin could inhibit 5-alpha reductase
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:17.040]   that converts testosterone to DHT, as you pointed out.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.020]   I stopped taking it.
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.200]   It was the only new addition to my diet and supplementation,
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.600]   and things bounced back within about three, four days,
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.880]   but it was remarkable.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.380]   I mean, I felt like garbage,
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:28.720]   and it was actually kind of frightening
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.540]   to experience the sharpness of that cliff.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.500]   But I know that some people like turmeric
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.440]   for its anti-inflammatory properties, et cetera.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:43.520]   Sounds like people either need to experiment or,
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.960]   and if they do, obviously to approach that with caution.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.460]   Anytime you add or remove something,
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.180]   you need to talk to your doctor.
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.840]   You're a doctor, and I'm guessing that
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.320]   if one were to experiment,
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.380]   would you say that most of these effects
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.240]   of things like curcumin are reversible as they were in me,
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.840]   or is there any potential of permanent damage
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.080]   if people have been taking them for a long time?
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.880]   - The effects are nearly always reversible.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.700]   When you're talking about five alpha reductase inhibition,
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.660]   so what turmeric does, but stronger,
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.280]   the most common story that we hear
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.500]   is regarding a supplement known as saw palmetto,
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.420]   which a lot of older men take for their prostate health,
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.120]   or finasteride, which you can take for your prostate,
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.240]   or your heart, or your hair, or dutasteride.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.760]   So if you're having side effects on these,
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.560]   then it's probably because of a couple different reasons.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:36.280]   One can be your ratio of androgens to estrogens is off,
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.720]   and that needs addressed.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.400]   Another one can be,
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.040]   it's inhibiting the conversion of your progesterone
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.200]   to that other type of progesterone,
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.280]   the five alpha, three alpha that we talked about earlier
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.720]   that's helping with your sleep,
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.060]   and your brain, and your calmness.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.960]   And that's definitely an effect.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.880]   Another one is depending on the type of supplement or med,
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.320]   they inhibit different isoenzymes
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.840]   of that five alpha reductase.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.660]   So if they're just inhibiting one and two,
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.280]   then that's gonna be a different effect
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.220]   than if they're inhibiting two and three.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.360]   So finasteride does two and three,
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.040]   saw palmetto does one and two,
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.900]   and then dutasteride does all three.
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.960]   The third one is active in the brain,
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.800]   and dutasteride inhibits that third one
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:23.820]   a little bit weaker in vivo, but strongly in vitro.
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:26.200]   So it's really hard to parse out.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.800]   You can use biofeedback and experimentation.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.400]   I do think with supplements, it's safe to experiment.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.300]   The time that it takes to set in
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.280]   is usually about three months.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.380]   So the risk of, and this is anecdotally,
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.160]   there's been lots of research published about
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:46.560]   if post finasteride syndrome is real or fake,
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.720]   and it is real, but it's one of those things
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.120]   that's a combination of organic and inorganic disease,
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.960]   almost kind of like fibromyalgia,
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.400]   where it's definitely real,
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.840]   and there's lots of things that you can do to help with it,
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.340]   but it's very unlikely to occur
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.360]   if you stop taking your supplement or medication
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.640]   after you have side effects.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.460]   - Interesting.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.800]   Well, I certainly feel better when I'm taking five grams
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.480]   of creatine monohydrate per day.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.600]   I know most people take it for muscle growth
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.020]   and tissue repair and things of that sort.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.360]   Mainly, I think, brings water
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.200]   into the muscle tissue, et cetera,
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.000]   but I take it for the brain effects,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.440]   and also because I like to think
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.360]   that it gives me a little bit of a DHT bump
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.360]   that I can actually see in my blood charts
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.200]   when I've done them.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.240]   I know many people want to avoid the hair loss
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.520]   that can sometimes be associated
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.520]   with DHT levels going too high,
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.160]   and so I've been asked many times,
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.780]   does creatine monohydrate cause hair loss?
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:44.980]   It would make sense that if creatine increases DHT and DHT,
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.840]   binding to the endocrine receptor on the scalp
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.280]   can induce hair loss, that that would be the case.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.280]   Is that true, or are people just overly concerned
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.900]   about something that's trivial or nonexistent?
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:01.180]   - Each male, so yes, it can potentially add it.
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.920]   I don't like to say it causes it,
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.200]   but it can be a little bit more fuel to the fire.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.840]   So just like everybody has a different sensitivity
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.180]   of their androgen receptor,
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:13.280]   they have a different amount of gene transcription
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.240]   that is going to cause death of the follicle.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.760]   That's an arbitrary threshold,
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.440]   so you don't really know until you start losing hair.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.480]   - And if somebody takes a little bit of creatine
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.280]   to increase their DHT,
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.840]   maybe for the cognitive enhancing effects
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.840]   or for whatever reason,
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.320]   and they notice a little bit more hair
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.040]   falling out in the sink and they stop taking it,
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.200]   you said death of the follicle, which sounds very dramatic.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.520]   Are those little stem cell niches
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.320]   that reside in the follicle, which hairs grow from,
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.920]   are those then abolished, like there's no going back,
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.380]   or can one rescue the hair?
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.560]   - It takes months.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.940]   If they're still there, the hair will come back.
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:53.100]   So the loss of the hair itself is a normal part
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:54.460]   of the hair cycle.
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.380]   So you have your androgen phase, your catagen phase,
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:00.060]   your telogen phase, and then your hair loss,
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:00.900]   and then a new follicle.
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.360]   - Of the stem cell niche in the hair follicle.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.220]   - Think of it like sharks have teeth.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.660]   So a shark loses a tooth
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.340]   and they have a new one that comes through,
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.160]   or losing your baby tooth and you have a new one,
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.000]   but your hair just always keeps coming through.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.180]   So it's natural for it to die and lose.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.740]   That's why when you start five alpha reductase inhibitors,
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.420]   often you have a big shed.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:22.520]   So what happens during that big shed
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:26.180]   is all of these cells that are unhealthy,
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:27.680]   they immediately jettison that hair
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.820]   and they start making a much healthier new follicle.
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:33.200]   So all of the hairs that are at the end
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.540]   of their telogen phase,
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.580]   then they have what's called telogen effluvium,
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.780]   which also happens after pregnancy,
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:44.740]   also happens in thyroid pathologies.
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.740]   So you shed it, a new one comes in place,
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.220]   and you think that you're having a horrible hair loss
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.980]   caused by your finasteride or whatever you're doing,
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.740]   and minoxidil does this too,
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.580]   but you're really just having a new, healthier follicle.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:00.280]   If you go a really long time, if you go a year,
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.100]   then those hairs might come back and they might not.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.180]   - So for simplicity's sake,
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.020]   if somebody is concerned about
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.440]   or is experiencing hair loss, male or female,
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:14.440]   what are their options of ways to offset that hair loss
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.340]   that are not going to negatively impact
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.140]   other tissues sensitive to DHT?
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.500]   And what I'm basically saying here is
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.460]   I could imagine taking a DHT inhibitor,
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.420]   a pill of some sort or an injection of some sort,
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.980]   and offsetting hair loss,
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.100]   maybe even stimulating more hair growth.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:35.540]   It's clear that I'm not doing that,
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.800]   but I know people that do,
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.300]   but then experience some of the other negative effects
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:41.880]   of blunting DHT, reduced affect, reduced libido,
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:45.840]   reduced drive, disruptions in prostate function
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.640]   or even sexual function generally.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.320]   So what can people do if they want to maintain
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.160]   or grow back hair,
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.320]   but they don't want all those other effects?
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.040]   What should they avoid?
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.080]   And what should they perhaps consider
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.680]   talking to their doctor about?
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.800]   - Yeah, there's a whole host of options.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:06.080]   I try to separate alopecia or hair loss
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.640]   into two different categories, male pattern baldness
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:13.440]   or androgenic alopecia, also known as androgenetic alopecia
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.720]   versus other types of alopecia, usually telogen effluviums.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.560]   And if it's androgenetic alopecia
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.760]   or male pattern baldness, even if they're female,
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.020]   perhaps say a PCOS, something like that,
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.560]   then you want some sort of strategy
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.680]   to decrease the activity of that androgen receptor.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.840]   - So women can get male pattern baldness?
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:34.680]   - Absolutely.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.520]   - Okay, I'm going to have to wrap my head around that one,
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.760]   but okay.
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:40.920]   So there's a lot of different things that you can do
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.760]   that are topical.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:45.080]   The most promising is called dutasteride mesotherapy.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:48.960]   Essentially what it is is it's very localized injections
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:52.040]   in areas that are prone to male pattern baldness,
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:57.040]   whether they're female or male, and it acts locally only,
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.960]   and you repeat these injections from time to time.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.020]   It decreases the conversion of testosterone to DHT
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.920]   just in the scalp.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.880]   - So that can avoid prostate effects.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.480]   And what are some of the negative effects
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:12.720]   of blocking DHT in females in the periphery,
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.080]   meaning not on the scalp or in the brain,
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.720]   but where is DHT doing its stuff?
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.260]   - Yeah, so it's both DHT
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:23.560]   and then also that 5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone,
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:27.520]   which is called THP or dihydroprogesterone
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.780]   or tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone.
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.560]   So they're active in the central nervous system,
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.240]   but it's also just active, again,
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:39.280]   binding to the androgen receptor in a female as well,
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.560]   causing them to have that effort feel good motivation.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.680]   A lot of women that are sensitive to DHT,
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.360]   'cause women can be sensitive to DHT as well,
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:52.480]   feel very different when they start an oral contraceptive,
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.840]   not because it alters their DHT to a huge amount.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.640]   It does to some degree,
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.700]   because of the negative feedback inhibition
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.340]   in the pituitary and less produced in the ovaries,
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:06.600]   but it increases SHBG really high.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.660]   So because their SHBGs are significantly higher,
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.500]   their free DHT is way lower.
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:16.260]   - How does a woman know if she has PCOS,
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:18.140]   polycystic ovarian syndrome?
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.860]   What are the issues with polycystic ovarian syndrome?
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:22.620]   What can be done about PCOS?
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.140]   I confess I was naive to PCOS.
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:28.860]   That wasn't supposed to rhyme, but since it does,
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.500]   I do confess I was completely naive to it.
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.900]   And I started getting a lot of questions about it
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.340]   in various forums.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.820]   And I think that's actually the reason
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.340]   why I initially approached you.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:42.300]   I know you have treated a lot of PCOS.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:46.600]   What age women should be thinking about PCOS?
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.140]   What's PCOS?
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:50.060]   Teach us about PCOS, please.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:54.140]   - So PCOS is polycystic ovarian syndrome.
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:58.640]   And this is one of those conditions which is underdiagnosed.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.580]   So its prevalence is much higher than we think it is.
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:04.820]   There's been a lot of studies and some studies
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:08.480]   say prevalence of 10%, some say 20%.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:10.840]   It's not completely clinically penetrant.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.120]   So most people don't know they have PCOS
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.220]   until they have infertility or subfertility.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:18.480]   - And is PCOS happening at this frequency
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.860]   in 20-year-old women and 30-year-old women
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:22.100]   and 40 and onward?
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.500]   - Most women find out they have PCOS in their 30s,
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.260]   especially because it's on a spectrum or a continuum
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:30.680]   like a lot of things where you can have a weaker version
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.060]   or a very severe version.
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.900]   - What are the symptoms?
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:37.520]   - There's a criteria called the Rotterdam criteria.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.060]   And in the Rotterdam criteria,
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:41.400]   there's a couple of different ways that you can diagnose it.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:45.940]   You're looking for androgen excess, insulin resistance,
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:47.900]   and you can also look for polycystic ovaries.
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.240]   You don't actually have to have polycystic ovaries
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.260]   or to get an ultrasound of your ovaries to be diagnosed.
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.780]   If you have androgen excess, for example,
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.500]   androgenic acne or hormonal acne.
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.660]   If you have hair growth, like a hair growth on the chin,
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.820]   it's called a hirsutism.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:06.540]   Or if you have, you know, like deepening of the voice,
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:11.540]   any symptom of too much male pattern baldness,
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.500]   if you're a female, that's a symptom of PCOS as well.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.220]   Then you can also have insulin resistance.
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:20.700]   So this is obesity, it's prediabetes,
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.660]   a high fasting insulin, a HOMA IR over two,
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.260]   a fasting insulin of over six.
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.520]   So if you have significant insulin resistance
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.780]   and also androgen dominance, that's a sign of it.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.380]   Androgen dominance often leads
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.700]   to what's called oligominorrhea.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:42.120]   So if you're having more than 35 day intervals
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.060]   in between a period,
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.740]   or if you have less than nine per year,
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.980]   then that can be a sign that you have oligo,
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.380]   which means too little, minorrhea, which means menses.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.020]   So that's a very common sign of PCOS.
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:01.460]   If you have infertility, so if you're under the age of 35
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:04.080]   and you've been trying for more than a year,
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.540]   or if you're over the age of 35
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.800]   and you've been trying for more than six months,
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.820]   then that can also be,
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.720]   it's a very common presenting complaint
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.840]   when somebody presents with PCOS.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.540]   - And assuming that a woman is doing all these other things,
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.180]   is paying attention to the six pillars
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.140]   that you talked about earlier, diet, exercise,
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.980]   caloric restriction, in some cases, right?
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.460]   Not everyone needs to be caloric restricted,
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:27.540]   stress, sleep and sunlight, spirit.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:30.100]   Assuming that they're doing all those things,
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.340]   what other things in the realm of diet or supplementation
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:37.460]   can help them avoid PCOS if they have subclinical PCOS
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.540]   or they have not developed it, but don't want to develop it?
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.800]   'Cause it doesn't sound like a good thing.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.540]   - Yeah, so depending on where they are,
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:49.340]   if they're very strong on the insulin resistance spectrum,
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.380]   then optimizing their body composition,
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:53.820]   decreasing their body fat
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.680]   and treating that metabolic syndrome can help.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.600]   So a lot of people ask, well, does everybody that's on,
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.160]   like does everybody need to be on metformin that has PCOS?
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.900]   Not necessarily, but metformin is one of the tools
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.080]   that can help with insulin sensitization.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.860]   Other tools that can help are inositol.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.220]   So myoinositol is an insulin sensitizer.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:21.220]   Its cousin, D-chiroinositol is a weak anti-androgen.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:26.800]   A lot of types of inositol have both of those in it.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.920]   So depending on if you're a female or a male
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.460]   and you're on inositol, the type of inositol does matter.
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:35.620]   - Yeah, this is a very important point.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:40.620]   Just today I said, I'm trying this new supplement inositol
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:45.460]   for its role in perhaps enhancing sleep even further.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.760]   My sleep's generally pretty good.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.620]   Lately it's been a little bit off for a number of reasons.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.620]   So I took it for the first time last night
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.480]   and I said, I thought it helped and just subjectively.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.980]   And you said, what kind of inositol is it?
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:00.180]   Because inositol is a very potent androgen inhibitor.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.600]   It turns out I was taking myoinositol,
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.160]   which is not an androgen inhibitor.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.000]   The other type that you mentioned,
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.300]   which is an androgen inhibitor is?
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.180]   - D-chiroinositol.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:15.380]   It's usually in a ratio of one to 25 or one to 40.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:18.500]   In a much lower amount compared to myoinositol.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.100]   - In a supplement or in the body?
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.340]   - In a supplement to help induce ovulation.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.740]   - But for women who have PCOS,
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.520]   who might want to try and reduce androgen,
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.580]   then they would perhaps want to take a form of inositol
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.060]   that reduce the androgen receptor activity, correct?
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:35.940]   - They want both.
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.300]   So if you're a woman and you've ever talked to your doctor
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.780]   about getting it on the oral contraceptive
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.640]   or spironolactone, which is also an anti-androgen,
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.120]   but it happens to be a potassium sparing
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.160]   diuretic blood pressure medicine as well.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.780]   D-chiroinositol might be a better option.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.720]   DIM or diindomethane is other,
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.960]   another kind of weak anti-estrogen, anti-androgen
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.220]   that a lot of women should consider as well.
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.660]   - You mentioned oral contraception.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:07.080]   I've done a few posts on these, let's just call them,
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.760]   they really are perceptual effects whereby
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.080]   it's been demonstrated in humans several times now
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.780]   in what appeared to me to be very solid studies
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:19.240]   where women that take oral contraceptives,
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:23.320]   there is both a shift in their perception of men,
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.920]   'cause these studies only looked at heterosexual,
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.780]   the sort of arrangements here,
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:32.740]   where women who are on oral contraception,
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.220]   because it blunts some of the peaks and valleys
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.820]   of hormone output,
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.500]   no longer experience the same peaks and valleys
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.680]   in their assessment of other men's attractiveness.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.800]   So it sort of flattens their perception, so to speak.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.520]   They still find certain men attractive
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.540]   and certain men unattractive,
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:55.540]   but the degree of difference is kind of mellowed out.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:05:00.220]   And likewise, these data say that
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:04.740]   men perceiving women's attractiveness,
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.900]   they still see women on oral contraceptives as attractive,
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.340]   but a woman taking oral contraception
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.500]   eliminates this kind of peak in her attractiveness
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.180]   that men would otherwise perceive.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.980]   In other words, oral contraceptives are changing
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.460]   the way that we perceive each other,
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:23.460]   at least in terms of these male-female experiments.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.520]   What is going on with that?
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.220]   Is that because oral contraceptives blunt
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:31.080]   the increase in testosterone that occurs
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.020]   just before ovulation?
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.020]   Or is it because of a complex cascade?
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:35.900]   What is going on?
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:37.240]   I find this fascinating.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:41.140]   - Yeah, so there's differences in how your,
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.760]   and I wouldn't use the word change necessarily,
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.760]   but alter the severity or alter the peak, as you said.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:53.580]   So it's just like TRT is not gonna change you as a person.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.500]   An oral contraceptive will not change you as a person.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:01.140]   It will just change your day-to-day peaks and troughs
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:06.140]   in libido and attractiveness.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:09.240]   So one of the main effects of oral contraceptives,
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.620]   almost all of them have a synthetic estrogen
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:14.220]   and a synthetic progestogen in them.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.120]   One common type of synthetic estrogen is ethyl estradiol.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.440]   There is another new synthetic estrogen
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.580]   that's out there as well, but anecdotally,
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.840]   that seems to have even more side effects.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.240]   So this ethyl estradiol is 100 times more potent
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.320]   than endogenous or bioidentical estradiol in the liver.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.560]   So it binds to the estrogen receptor in the liver
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.720]   and it's going to increase sex hormone binding globulin,
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.680]   which secondarily, as you mentioned,
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.760]   decreases your free testosterone
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.380]   and especially your free DHT.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:49.260]   So that little testosterone hump that you get
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.280]   when you're a female that's ovulating,
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.920]   that's really flatlined and it's already,
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.920]   it's a pretty insignificant difference.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.800]   It's not negligible, but it's a little bit of a hump
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.180]   and you have significantly less of that
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.800]   when you're on oral contraceptive.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.320]   - And does that blunt the associated increase in libido
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.040]   that normally would occur from that increase in androgen?
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.480]   - Yes. - Interesting.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.820]   And what about other forms of contraception, right?
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.160]   'Cause there are, there's copper IUD,
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.800]   there's various implants, there's rings,
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.420]   there's a huge number of different forms of these.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:26.240]   So what we're talking about is, as I understand it,
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.480]   is only the effect of oral contraception
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.960]   that impacts hormone output, is that correct?
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.820]   - Yeah, there's a lot of other effects as well.
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:39.360]   For example, your choice of synthetic progestin
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.020]   will alter how high your platelets and SHBG go.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:46.520]   It appears to be the higher your platelets
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.180]   and the higher your SHBG, the higher risk of a blood clot.
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:51.900]   So a lot of women know that
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.460]   if they're on an oral contraceptive
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:56.100]   and they're already predisposed to a blood clot
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:58.940]   or a venous thromboembolism in their vein,
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:01.580]   they have a blood clot in either their leg or their lung,
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.900]   then it can increase that chance.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.980]   So you can choose a synthetic progestin
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:10.320]   that is not going to have as high of a response.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.060]   But there's various pros and cons.
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.900]   Some synthetic progestins are weak anti-androgens as well.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:19.280]   For example, there's one known as Slind,
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.700]   which is made from spironolactone.
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:26.160]   So some women are on spironolactone and that as well,
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.380]   which is made from spironolactone,
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.660]   which probably isn't particularly necessary
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:32.340]   unless they need it for a diuretic or hypertensive effect.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.180]   - I see.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.080]   I'm just going to intentionally interrupt and I apologize,
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.460]   but specifically because I wanted to ask about,
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:44.020]   there is this notion that, you know,
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:46.860]   that oral contraception taken over long periods of time
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:50.060]   can disrupt fertility in ways that are independent
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:54.580]   of just the age-related decrease in fertility.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.140]   Is that true?
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.100]   - It depends on what you mean by a long time.
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.460]   Six to 12 months, it's possible.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:03.580]   Past that, it seems very unlikely.
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.980]   However, the persistently elevated SHBG
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:08.780]   can be present for quite some time.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:11.300]   - Wait, so if a woman takes oral contraception
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:13.780]   for six to 12 months and then stops,
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:17.440]   will she essentially be where she would have been anyway
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.820]   in terms of her fertility at that age?
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.920]   Or are you saying that it can cause permanent damage?
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.360]   - Her fertility would be equitable
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.880]   as if she had never taken it,
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.920]   if she's certainly 12 months, but probably six months off.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.960]   - And what if she,
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.840]   I know of women that have taken an oral contraception
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.720]   for many years.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.040]   In addition to the age-related decline in fertility
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.320]   that occurs, that's inevitable.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:40.800]   Of course, the slope is going to be different
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.640]   depending on the individual,
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   but are they quickening the transition to infertility?
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.780]   - Probably not.
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:55.580]   You could make a case that because they've been an oral
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:59.820]   contraceptive, they may have been slightly more predisposed
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:04.820]   to insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass,
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:08.860]   but that's probably going to be a negligible difference
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.500]   compared to their resistance training
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.780]   and also their caloric restriction or caloric maintenance.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:16.080]   - So of course, there are also effects of having children.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.920]   I mean, on all these parameters, right?
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.860]   'Cause it's a major lifestyle shift, right?
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:26.020]   That obviously people contend with and have first
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:29.120]   since the beginning of human time anyway.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.180]   I want to ask some questions about male hormone therapy
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:35.340]   and male hormones generally.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.340]   But before I do that,
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.840]   I have a couple of burning questions that I get very often
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.540]   that I'm just going to insert now.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.940]   Marijuana.
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:47.660]   I've heard that it can decrease testosterone
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.820]   in men and women.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:51.260]   I've heard that it can increase testosterone.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:53.340]   Alcohol.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:57.980]   I think there's general consensus that high alcohol intake,
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:01.740]   high barbiturate intake does in fact reduce testosterone.
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.700]   What about modest increase of alcohol?
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:04.520]   I'm not a drinker,
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.980]   so I'm not asking these questions for me.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.420]   I don't smoke pot and quite over.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:10.020]   I just never really liked marijuana or alcohol.
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.140]   They're not my thing.
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:14.140]   But many people want to know the answers to these.
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:17.100]   And the data that I've seen are very confused
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.320]   and conflicting.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.260]   So what about marijuana?
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:23.420]   Does it reduce testosterone to a significant degree or not?
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:27.220]   - Cannabinoids itself, whether it's THC or CBD,
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.700]   are not going to reduce testosterone by themselves.
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.940]   If it's smoked marijuana,
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:36.620]   then it's very likely to increase your aromatase,
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:39.300]   which increases your estrogen.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:43.340]   And it's aromatizing from testosterone.
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:45.740]   So that is going to decrease testosterone.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:49.260]   When you have an increased estrogen, like estradiol,
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.060]   that's going to work on your pituitary
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:55.260]   to make less hormones that cause the release of testosterone.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.900]   So you're going to have less LH and less FSH.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.940]   So it's almost kind of like, you know,
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:04.960]   opiates are well known to opiate agonists.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.380]   They're going to decrease LH and FSH
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:09.900]   and subsequently testosterone.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.580]   Smoked marijuana will as well.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:15.860]   As far as alcohol, high alcohol will decrease testosterone
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:19.200]   as will any very potent GABA agonist,
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.380]   whether it's a barbiturate or benzodiazepine
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:24.440]   or a non-benzo or alcohol, they're definitely going to.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.980]   Moderate alcohol, I guess it depends
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.700]   on what your definition of that is.
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:31.340]   The American- - I guess I'm thinking like,
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.980]   some people I know that don't seem to be alcoholics,
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.700]   at least by my, you know, assessment,
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:40.900]   will have a glass or two of wine four nights a week,
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.620]   which to me seems like a tremendous amount
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:46.060]   only because I don't like alcohol.
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:48.100]   I don't have a problem with other people liking alcohol,
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.320]   but I think for many people,
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.780]   that would be considered low or moderate intake.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.580]   - Yeah, I would consider that low intake.
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:59.400]   The American Heart Association for men recommends
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.220]   between one and two drinks a day on average.
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:03.300]   - They recommend it?
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:04.740]   - Yeah, so around one per week.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.380]   - Wait, so I'm making my heart less healthy
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.740]   by not drinking alcohol?
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:11.540]   - Yeah, they recommend a very low amount of alcohol intake
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.360]   for men.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.760]   For women, they recommend zero to one.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.220]   So that's kind of hard to interpret, zero to one.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.460]   But the protective effect of alcohol,
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:25.360]   especially if it's a red wine with polyphenols in it,
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.460]   outweighs the deleterious effect.
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:29.820]   - Interesting, 'cause I've seen some studies
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:34.540]   that point to the idea that even low intake of alcohol
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.660]   over a prolonged period of time
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:37.940]   might actually decrease brain volume
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.860]   or at least volume of particular brain areas.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:41.160]   But of course, we don't know the consequence
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.460]   of decreasing the volume of a given brain area either.
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:45.860]   I mean, one could imagine it's decreasing
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.900]   the size of one's amygdala and making them less stressed,
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.660]   although there's no evidence to support that.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:52.160]   I've been told that I need a drink many, many times,
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.620]   but I always reply to I don't need to drink anything
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.820]   in order to speak my mind.
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:59.020]   So again, individual differences.
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.720]   Very interesting, so it sounds like smoked marijuana
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.260]   may in fact reduce testosterone
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.020]   or at least increase the conversion
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.420]   of testosterone to estrogen, correct?
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.260]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.060]   - And with alcohol and GABA agonist,
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:12.780]   it's important to remember that it shouldn't be daily.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.820]   So one drink of alcohol a day
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.540]   is actually very mildly immunosuppressive.
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:20.820]   So it's better to have two drinks of alcohol
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:21.680]   one day of the week,
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.700]   and then two more drinks of alcohol another day of the week,
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.920]   and then no alcohol the rest of the time.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.060]   The same could be said even for supplements
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.340]   that have GABA in them.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.460]   A lot of sleep supplements have immunobutyric acid,
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.700]   which is GABA, so. - I occasionally take,
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.540]   oh, sorry to interrupt.
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:39.100]   I occasionally take 100 to 200 milligrams of GABA
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.100]   in order to enhance sleep,
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.740]   but I do it maybe every third or four nights,
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.900]   no more than three or four nights a week.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:45.820]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.940]   - That's perfect. - Okay.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.780]   - So there's a lot of sleep supplements
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:52.640]   that should not be taken daily, and GABA is one of them.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.520]   Another one of them is trazodone,
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.620]   and melatonin is kind of arguable,
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.600]   and it depends on the situation.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.860]   But in general, if you're taking a sleep supplement,
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:05.020]   it should not be taken every night.
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.520]   - The sleep supplements that I understand are okay
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.080]   to take every night or nearly every night
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.400]   are things like magnesium threonate, apigenin.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.680]   If that's not true, correct me.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.940]   I certainly take them every night
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.140]   unless I forget them back home when I'm traveling.
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:21.900]   - Magnesium is one of the exceptions.
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.680]   L-theanine is also another exception.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.420]   - Great, well then at least I haven't put anything
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:31.220]   into the world that's wrong in that category yet,
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:32.140]   and hopefully I won't.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.340]   But if I do, I'll correct myself.
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:37.220]   So let's talk about testosterone in males.
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:40.540]   You see these headlines all the times
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.980]   now that testosterone levels are dropping,
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:45.460]   sperm counts are dropping,
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:48.980]   phenotypes of men are changing over time,
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:51.700]   and I can't quite follow the literature on that
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.740]   because obviously those are hard controlled experiments
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:58.660]   to do because techniques change over time
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.120]   and sensitivity of techniques change over time.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.020]   But regardless, I'm aware that a lot of people
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:08.180]   are considering increasing their testosterone
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:09.780]   by taking testosterone.
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:12.260]   A few years ago, that was considered steroid use
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:14.740]   and it was really extreme kind of stance.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.480]   Nowadays, it seems like there's more discussion about it.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.880]   First off, I'd like to know,
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.740]   does testosterone supplementation,
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:25.540]   and here I'm talking about prescription from a doctor,
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:28.700]   does it make one more prone to prostate cancer?
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:31.780]   That seems to always be the first question that comes out.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.480]   - Yeah, and there is a huge amount of misinformation
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.840]   about this too.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.160]   So testosterone is not going to cause a prostate cancer.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.820]   However, normal aging causes prostate cancer
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:47.380]   and testosterone will grow your prostate cancer.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:52.840]   So if you're a 80 year old male and you have an autopsy
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.820]   and there's at least a 50% chance
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.480]   that you have a prostate cancer,
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.180]   if you're 90 or a hundred years old,
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.580]   there's at least a 90% chance.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:04.140]   So for humans with a prostate,
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.660]   it's only a matter of time until you get a prostate cancer.
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:08.860]   So that begs the question,
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:11.140]   do you want to take something that's going to grow it
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.840]   for sure once you have it?
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.980]   So it's an individual assessment
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.840]   and it's important to follow things like PSAs as well.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.820]   - So a PSA of four or less,
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.160]   I mean, ideally you wouldn't be at four
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.740]   'cause that's kind of the upper threshold,
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.200]   is the simplest readout of whether or not
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.800]   there's excessive prostate growth.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.500]   There's benign prostate hyperplasia
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.320]   where the prostate is growing,
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.720]   but it's non-cancerous, correct?
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.640]   And then of course there are the symptomologies,
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.640]   like people have challenges of urination,
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.080]   they have sexual difficulties, et cetera.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.180]   I'm always struck by the correlation
[01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:48.440]   that people draw between testosterone and prostate health.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.760]   And the fact that, or I should say the claim
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.640]   that testosterone makes prostate health worse,
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.920]   because if you think about it,
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.320]   young males have high testosterone often,
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.120]   if not always, certainly often,
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.100]   and you don't see a lot of prostate overgrowth
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:05.840]   and cancer in young males.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.600]   So something's going on here.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.000]   How should we conceptualize this?
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.800]   - So if you have a PSA of 3.9
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.800]   and you're a 25 year old male versus a 75 year old male,
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.480]   and you have a PSA of 5.9,
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:25.260]   the 3.9 PSA is significantly more concerning.
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:29.400]   So think of your prostate as taking cumulative damage
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.380]   from not only testosterone,
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:34.920]   but also estrogen and also growth hormone.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:37.160]   So that's why obese individuals
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.880]   have higher incidences of prostate cancer as well.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.920]   It's because they don't have those cell checkpoints
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:46.560]   where your immune system takes a second and says,
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.480]   "All right, stop replicating as fast prostate cells.
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.080]   Let's see if there's any atypical ones."
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.600]   And then it finds those
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:56.080]   and it prevents them from reproducing.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.480]   That's why immunotherapy and cancer is so promising
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.600]   is because they can target these certain things.
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:05.000]   So the older male is going to have
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.840]   that cumulative damage happen already.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.980]   And arguably prostate cancer is a normal,
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:18.880]   with aging, fast aging is abnormal,
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.760]   very slow aging is normal.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.200]   There's a fine line to walk between those two,
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.260]   but there's a lot of things that can be done
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:30.160]   to decrease the turnover, decrease the inflammation,
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.880]   and decrease the congestion of the prostate over time.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.240]   There's also a lot more than just PSAs that can be done.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.400]   There's prostate MRIs and things like that
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.000]   that can look at the structure
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.260]   and the function of the prostate.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.560]   - So what should every male do
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.260]   to maintain the health of their prostate?
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.440]   And I realized that younger males
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.640]   probably aren't thinking about it at all.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.880]   Although it seems like nowadays,
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.480]   I get these kind of what I call cryptic questions.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.760]   I think women are more comfortable
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.580]   talking about their hormone and sexual health
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:59.040]   because of menstrual cycles.
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.160]   They're used to fluctuations that sort of give them
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.160]   the experience of what it's like to have different levels
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.600]   of progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.480]   But I get these kind of cryptic questions
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.040]   often in my direct messages
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.680]   where what I think people are asking is,
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:16.160]   is there something wrong with my prostate?
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.560]   What should I do for my prostate?
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.720]   These are often indirect questions
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.560]   for other aspects of their life where they're suffering.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.280]   And I don't say that in jest.
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.760]   I think more direct discussion would be great.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:31.760]   So what should all males do to maintain prostate health
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.240]   throughout the lifespan?
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:37.120]   - Maintaining prostate health can be looked at similarly
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:40.960]   how you can maintain a good, natural, optimal testosterone.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.720]   So you look for things that can hurt it.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.000]   You don't necessarily look for one thing
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.320]   that can improve it or boost it.
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:51.000]   So for young males, those are prostatitis.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.120]   So it goes hand in hand with epididymitis.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.920]   So different infections of the prostate.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.640]   The younger the male is, the more likely it is related
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.940]   to something that could be sexually transmitted.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.960]   But another very common cause is what we call
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.920]   gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:13.920]   The prostate is right by the end of the colon.
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:18.880]   So if you have chronic constipation or if you have colitis,
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:22.480]   or if you have, you know, even just an E. coli overgrowth
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.920]   in the colon is very likely to cause an infection
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.580]   of the prostate as well.
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:30.140]   - What should males do to prevent that?
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:34.460]   - Have a diet that has good, healthy prebiotic fiber,
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.940]   probiotics as well.
[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:39.260]   Make sure that they're having regular bowel movements,
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.580]   that they don't have chronic constipation.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.500]   Have good sources of dietary fiber,
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.320]   which is also known as soluble fiber
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.000]   and enough insoluble fiber.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.600]   Most people get enough insoluble or non-dietary fiber.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.880]   So that can help prevent the chance of diverticulitis,
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:57.360]   which is another type of infection.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.800]   It can also decrease the chance of colitis
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.840]   and decrease the chance of prostate infections as well.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.260]   - Are there any foods and/or supplements
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.400]   that men should take or avoid?
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.520]   What about, you hear about salt palmetto.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:16.160]   Yeah, supplements for, or supplements that support
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.520]   or cause issues for the prostate.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.340]   - Yeah, if there's a strong genetic predisposition
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.560]   to enlarged prostates,
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.320]   or even just really early prostate cancers that grow fast,
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.920]   then they could consider taking salt palmetto
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:32.160]   or even curcumin as an anti-androgen,
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.920]   as long as they're able to tolerate it.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:37.260]   It's an individualized basis and depends on their history.
[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:41.880]   As far as making sure that their prostate
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.700]   is not congested, there's an interesting correlation
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:49.120]   between having girls and having prostate cancer.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.360]   - Having girls offspring.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.240]   - So if your offspring are females,
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.880]   then you're slightly more likely to have prostate cancer.
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.320]   There is some, there's hypotheses that link estrogen
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.440]   to prostate cancer rather than testosterone.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.840]   So if you have hyper-estrogenism,
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:10.760]   your prostate has more atypical cells.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.720]   In general, the higher your C-reactive protein,
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.060]   which is the general marker of inflammation in your body,
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:20.480]   we call it CRP, and the test order is HS-CRP,
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.920]   or high sensitivity CRP.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:26.300]   If your CRP raises up very high,
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:27.960]   if you have an autoimmune disease,
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.840]   like if you have a Crohn's flare,
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.040]   or if you have a lupus or an infection
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.580]   or a sexually transmitted infection,
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:38.180]   or even a colitis or even the flu,
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.480]   your CRP is gonna raise significantly.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.160]   - That you would detect in a blood test, of course.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.000]   - Correct, yeah.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.640]   So you wanna get a baseline CRP
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.980]   when you haven't had any of those things recently.
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:49.980]   And if your CRP is higher,
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:52.720]   you also have more female offspring.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:56.820]   If your CRP is higher, then your reactive oxygen species,
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:00.200]   which are causing mutations and atypical cell turnover
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.760]   in the prostate, are also likely higher.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:05.440]   So you wanna keep a very low CRP.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.280]   - Interesting.
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.360]   And what about blood flow and pelvic floor in general?
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.540]   - We should probably do a whole episode on pelvic floor.
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:14.160]   There's so much interesting data
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:17.640]   coming out of the fields of clinical and research urology.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.140]   I realize it's kind of the Netherlands
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.780]   of biology and medicine.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.460]   People probably aren't thinking so much about this,
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:26.280]   but pelvic floor is obviously a confluence
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:29.360]   of a ton of vasculature, of nerves,
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.100]   and of course the prostate resides there,
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.820]   and of course the genitals reside there as well.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:38.120]   So I would imagine that one of the six pillars,
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.400]   you know, exercise,
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.320]   being able to maintain adequate blood flow
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.960]   to those regions is key.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.220]   What about just postural things?
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:49.380]   People sitting too much, not hydrating well enough.
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:51.580]   You mentioned avoiding constipation.
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:52.720]   What are some other things,
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.640]   including medications that can serve
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.780]   to support the prostate over time,
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.360]   and maybe even support pelvic floor in general,
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.640]   both in males and females over time?
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.480]   - Absolutely.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.920]   And this is something that's rightfully
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.460]   getting more and more attention.
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:09.520]   The way I explain the pelvic floor is your abdominal cavity,
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.080]   which includes your peritoneum,
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.760]   or where most of your organs are,
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.460]   your retroperitoneum, your pelvic space.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:16.660]   Think of it as a box,
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:18.760]   and your abs are the front of the box.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.320]   Your back muscles are the back.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.600]   Your diaphragm is the top of the box,
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.080]   and your pelvic floor,
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.760]   that's where your port is to the outside world.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:29.680]   Especially important, it has muscles as well,
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:31.040]   and you can do exercises.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.620]   Pelvic floor physical therapists are becoming more
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:35.800]   and more utilized, especially after childbirth,
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.560]   but in other situations as well,
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.480]   including by men getting care from urologists.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.720]   So you want to both strengthen that pelvic floor,
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:48.480]   and make sure that the tubes that are docked
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.780]   to the outside world are working well enough,
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:54.680]   but they're not too loose, they're not working too well.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:59.420]   So there's a lot of medications that can be positives
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.820]   or negatives for your pelvic floor.
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:05.080]   We kind of talked about your gut and colon health in general.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.040]   As far as your prostate health,
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.380]   and as far as your bladder and urinary system health,
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:13.160]   you think about a couple of different classes.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.940]   So you have your phosphodiesterases,
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.340]   you have your Tidalofil.
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:20.860]   Basically, this is going to help decrease congestion
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:22.620]   in the prostate.
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.020]   A lot of people take it for ED,
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:26.760]   but it can actually help you decrease your-
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:27.680]   - Do you define that?
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:31.600]   - A lot of men take Tidalofil, it's generic as Cialis,
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.160]   as a much longer half-life than Viagra or Levitra.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.120]   It's half-life is almost a day.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.640]   So you can take a very low dose of it.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.080]   Instead of taking 20 milligrams,
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.040]   you take two or two and a half milligrams.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.960]   - So they're taking, you're saying that a lot of men
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.600]   take it for erectile dysfunction,
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.640]   but that at lower doses, it may have served purposes
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.300]   for prostate health independent of erection.
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:54.140]   - Correct.
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:57.960]   The most common scenario is if a male is waking up twice
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.420]   at night to pee, on average, it'll cut that down to once.
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:03.600]   So if they're waking up at four times at night,
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.800]   then it can cut that down to twice at night,
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.480]   just because you have easier blood flow.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:09.820]   We used to use other medications like Flomax,
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:11.520]   which is Tamsulosin.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.000]   That's an alpha antagonist.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.400]   So it basically binds to a receptor in smooth muscle
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.920]   and it helps relax that.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.720]   There's several other alpha antagonists.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.000]   And then you also have your medications that are hormonal,
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.340]   like finasteride, that a lot of people take
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:28.620]   for prostate health to decrease the enlargement
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:29.840]   of the prostate.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.360]   The periurethral area or periurethral lobe,
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.960]   there are several lobes of the prostate,
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.820]   that tends to be especially enlarged in cases of BPH.
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:41.540]   - And BPH?
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:45.060]   - Prostate hyperplasia or an enlarged prostate.
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:48.060]   And if you are able to shrink that area,
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:51.240]   then at that point it's just a plumbing problem
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:53.700]   and the urine is able to get by easier.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:57.240]   - Yeah, my understanding is that now there's a growing,
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.640]   I don't want to say a movement, but take,
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:03.160]   the idea of taking very low dose,
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:06.560]   like 2.5 milligram or five milligram to Dallafil,
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.440]   even daily is becoming pretty common for many men
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.620]   who do not have erectile dysfunction,
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.040]   simply to either maintain or enhance prostate health.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.240]   Is that correct?
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.080]   - Yeah, that's correct.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:18.920]   - And are there,
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.880]   do you see any negative effects of doing that?
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.320]   - There can be negative effects.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.760]   It can lower blood pressure.
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.320]   So theoretically it can increase your chance
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.400]   of vasovagal syncope.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:32.300]   A lot of people take it as a alternative to pump
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:35.180]   because it kind of works similarly to citrulline
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:38.760]   or a different pump products in pre-workout.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.220]   And it can certainly help with that.
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:42.400]   But if you're about to go do a deadlift
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.000]   where you might pass that anyway,
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.660]   it can certainly increase the chance that that happens
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:48.640]   because you don't have that compensatory
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:51.400]   exercise hypertension response.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.560]   - Could someone just take it away from exercise?
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.760]   - They could.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.120]   If you took to Dallafil then that's gonna be,
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.960]   has a long half-life.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.760]   Whereas Viagra and Levitra is just a few hours.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.480]   Dallafil is almost a day.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:09.520]   Some interesting studies on Viagra have been done as well.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.600]   It can potentially alter your rays and cones in your eye.
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.400]   So the usual recommendation for pilots
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.920]   that need to have red-green discrimination
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.600]   from very long distances with very small indicator lights
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.400]   is to not take Viagra.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.640]   So I usually say, if you're a pilot
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.800]   and that's your profession,
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.940]   perhaps hold off from that for a while.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:34.960]   There's also studies with Viagra that significantly,
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:38.560]   which is also known as sildenafil as the generic now,
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.080]   it can increase eyebrow hair growth.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.380]   So potentially what it does is it helps vasodilate
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.320]   and relax the veins, especially in older men.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.080]   And when those veins are relaxed,
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.960]   you have better blood flow.
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.660]   That's one of the proposals or theories
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:59.280]   behind why older men get the androgenetic alopecia more.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.440]   You're having less blood flow in the scalp.
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.200]   So theoretically it can also help prevent that.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.180]   - So in theory increasing blood,
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:08.000]   oh, because it increases blood flow
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.600]   systemically throughout the body,
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:12.560]   not just in specific tissues.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.960]   Well, I find it incredibly interesting that, yeah,
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.760]   there are these online forums building up now
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.500]   around low dose to Dallafil,
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.640]   daily use of low dose to Dallafil.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.000]   Again, not for sexual or erectile dysfunction,
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.220]   but for sake of long-term prostate health.
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:31.280]   Is there any reason why women might want
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:33.300]   to take low dose to Dallafil?
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:39.920]   - To Dallafil is also a weak androgen receptor sensitizer,
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:43.040]   kind of like L-carnitine where the density
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.140]   of the available androgen receptors to bind
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:48.120]   increases slightly.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:52.520]   So there could potentially be a benefit from that,
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:55.080]   but most of the time it's used in men.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:55.980]   - Very interesting.
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:59.600]   We haven't really talked about testosterone
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.760]   and optimizing testosterone in males.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:05.760]   Assuming someone is paying attention to the six pillars,
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:10.880]   there's a kind of a gap as I see it between
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:15.800]   doing all those things and TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:18.960]   And again, the R, the replacement in TRT
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.980]   is a little bit of a, in quotes nowadays,
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:24.980]   because a lot of people who have testosterone
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.700]   in that 300 to 900 nanogram per deciliter range
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:30.920]   opt to take low dose testosterone anyway.
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:34.600]   My understanding is that there've been
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:38.080]   new kind of movements in this area toward, for instance,
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:43.080]   not doing big, large doses injected infrequently,
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:46.380]   but rather low doses quite frequently,
[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:47.640]   obviously prescribed by a doctor,
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.960]   monitored by a doctor, et cetera.
[01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.240]   Is that generally what you like to see in your patients
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.360]   if they're going to take this route?
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.120]   - If they're a hypogonadal patient
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.800]   whose benefits outweigh risks of TRT,
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:05.100]   then you want to have a nice, even steady state.
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.720]   It's not going to be exactly the same as producing
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:11.480]   pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:12.840]   from your own body.
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.740]   When you have a steady state,
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:16.320]   you don't have a peak or a trough.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.720]   And when you have a peak,
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.840]   that's when the androgen receptor gene is overactive.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.200]   That's when you get more erythropoietin or EPO release.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:27.560]   And that leads to a lot of the side effects of thick blood,
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:30.000]   so higher hemoglobins and hematocrits.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.920]   And then when you have a crash, you don't feel good.
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:37.040]   So it's definitely not optimal.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.960]   There's a lot of ways to get around this.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.560]   So when you're doing testosterone replacement,
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.440]   if you're someone that needs it,
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:46.000]   you can have different types of esters
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.560]   or you could do topical testosterone.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:52.160]   So the ester is basically something that's attached
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.760]   to increase the biological half-life.
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:57.300]   The most common ones are cipunate and anthate.
[01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:59.320]   There's also a very short-acting propionate,
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.720]   which has almost no clinical relevance.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.780]   And there's also very long-acting ones,
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.980]   decanoate and undecanoate,
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:08.660]   and different mixtures of all those.
[01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:12.580]   So if you're someone who has a very, very low SHBG,
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:14.180]   you're going to have trouble
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:17.540]   of regulating your serum testosterone in the long run.
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:20.180]   If you do it topically, then the testosterone is absorbed,
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:22.260]   hopefully bound to SHBG.
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:24.140]   And then a lot of times you reapply twice daily
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:26.940]   or once daily, but you have lots of variations.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.540]   So for most people,
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:31.580]   especially for people who can absorb it well,
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:33.060]   that's not going to be a great option.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:34.740]   - So injections would be preferred.
[01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.660]   - Most people end up injecting
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:39.980]   because they have either side effects from too high, too low,
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:43.300]   or just too much of a varied dose when they do topical.
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:47.620]   There's also a capsule with a special lymphatic absorption.
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:49.540]   So it's not being absorbed through the liver.
[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:51.000]   It's not hepatically metabolized,
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.960]   but it's absorbed through the lymph.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:56.260]   And it's essentially testosterone undecanoate
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:58.380]   and then put into a capsule.
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:01.260]   So, and that's taken twice daily.
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:03.100]   It has fairly steady half-lives,
[01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:05.780]   but you have to take it at specific times of the day.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.420]   So that being said,
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:09.780]   and it's new enough to where there isn't a huge amount
[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:12.500]   of data on it, but it is FTA approved.
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:14.920]   So it is brand name now.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:19.520]   It's called Jotenzo, but the injectables in general,
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:23.260]   the lower your SHBG, the longer of an ester you want,
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:24.900]   because when you inject it,
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:26.940]   whether it's intramuscular or subcutaneous,
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:28.620]   just talk to your doctor about the risks
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:29.540]   and the benefits of those.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:32.100]   Subcutaneous has slightly longer active half-life
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:34.340]   because the esterases take longer to reach
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:37.780]   that cipunate or an ester to cleave it.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:40.940]   So most men, a lot of people ask me about
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.520]   like what a usual dose is.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:47.100]   For most people, it would be a total of about 100 to 120
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:49.560]   per week for an actual replacement dose.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.020]   - Milligrams. - Milligrams.
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:53.940]   120 to 100 milligrams per week,
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.180]   administered two to three times per week.
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:58.280]   - And you're not, so you're saying dividing that
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.620]   into two or three, right?
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:00.540]   'Cause I'm sure there are a bunch of people
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:02.640]   out there thinking, oh yeah, 100 three times a week,
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.720]   which is actually quite, quite high dose.
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:07.220]   Yeah, there really does seem to be a shift
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:10.800]   toward spreading these dosages out into,
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.560]   dividing them into two or three smaller doses.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:18.440]   And then along those lines, five, 10 years ago,
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:21.020]   it was common to hear about inhibiting estrogen
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.460]   through aromatase inhibitors.
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:25.180]   Nowadays you hear, and I think it's true,
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:27.120]   at least by my read of the literature,
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:30.280]   that that inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function,
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:32.160]   can cause connective tissue issues,
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:35.160]   and even can cause reductions in libido.
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:38.560]   So a lot of people think that estrogen,
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:42.040]   if you crash estrogen, that basically libido goes up,
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:43.680]   but actually the opposite is often true.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.720]   You don't want estrogen too high or too low.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:46.560]   Is that correct?
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:47.420]   And for that reason,
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:53.640]   do you shy away from people taking aromatase inhibitors?
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.800]   - Yeah, very few people truly need an aromatase inhibitor.
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.800]   There's almost always lifestyle interventions.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:04.160]   It can just depend on which gene,
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.280]   how active your aromatase gene is.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.200]   Some people's aromatase gene is very active.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.920]   A lot of times these individuals
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.760]   have pubertal gynecomastia,
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.240]   which is breast tissue growth in males,
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:18.360]   even despite no other risk factor.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:19.600]   - Even if they're lean?
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:22.320]   - Some people get it if they're lean.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.120]   - I remember growing up, there were a few kids
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:27.800]   that got mild cases of gynecomastia that were transient.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.960]   Like it's sort of like they developed gynecomastia
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.320]   and then it went away.
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.880]   Often it's unilateral on one side too.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.080]   So growth hormone a lot of times is the fuel to that fire.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.240]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.360]   Yeah, there were a couple of kids.
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.640]   I mean, they took some teasing 'cause back then
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:45.680]   there wasn't online discussions about hormones
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.060]   and things like that, but then it would seem transient.
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:49.760]   And they were, the people I'm thinking of
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.520]   were actually lean individuals.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.640]   So they weren't overweight,
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.880]   which of course can cause gynecomastia
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.440]   because adipose fat tissue
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.380]   can convert testosterone into estrogen.
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.440]   - So it sounds like, except in special cases,
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.200]   that avoiding aromatase inhibitors
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.240]   is probably gonna be a good idea.
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:08.120]   - There's several other ways
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:09.640]   that you can control your estrogen
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.120]   and keep it at a healthy level,
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.200]   which you do have to check.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.980]   There's a lot of patients who assure me
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:16.920]   that their estrogen is going to be sky high
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:20.020]   and it's actually very low and vice versa.
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.600]   But calcium D-glucarate is a supplement
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.480]   that can help with estrogen control.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.920]   - What's a typical dosage of calcium D-glucarate?
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.960]   - 500 to 1000 milligrams.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.160]   - But is there the risk that if someone's estrogen
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.920]   is in normal range and they take the supplement
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.600]   that their estrogen will go too low?
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.460]   Is it that potent?
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:38.360]   - It's not that potent.
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:40.640]   It's not near as potent as an aromatase inhibitor.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:42.440]   So it helps with excretion
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:46.100]   and also the sensitivity of the estrogen receptor itself.
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:48.760]   It kind of like helps out-compete it.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.720]   Some people will also take DIM
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.900]   or different cruciferous vegetable.
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:57.960]   They get them from cruciferous vegetables like kale,
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.840]   but, or broccoli.
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:04.680]   And that is both an anti-estrogen and an anti-androgen.
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.000]   So if you're on TRT and you're on that,
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.240]   then you're probably just on too much TRT.
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:10.840]   - Yeah, I remember a few years ago I had a friend
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:13.800]   and it truly is, it's not like I have a friend's thing.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.840]   'Cause I'm very cautious about which supplements I take.
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.520]   I think people might get the impression
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.640]   that I'm very cavalier about this, but I'm not.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.240]   I always alter one thing at a time.
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:22.360]   I talk to physicians.
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:24.400]   What I suggest other people do,
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.760]   I actually do and have done for a long period of time.
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:30.160]   And I recall wanting to take DIM
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.820]   'cause I thought, well, back then you hear,
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:34.120]   okay, reduce estrogen.
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:36.560]   My estrogen levels weren't out of range, so they were fine.
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.160]   But I thought, well, what would the experience be
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.000]   of bringing those down?
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.640]   But someone I know is quite informed in this area said,
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:42.880]   yeah, exactly what you said,
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.520]   which is that DIM can reduce estrogen,
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:45.560]   but also testosterone.
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.140]   So I just never opted to try and take it.
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:50.400]   I do want, we're sort of erring in this direction,
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:54.240]   but we went straight from the six pillars to TRT
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.820]   or to what some people now call sports TRT,
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:59.960]   which is basically code language for saying,
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:02.440]   taking exogenous testosterone,
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:03.680]   even though one doesn't need it
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:07.080]   to get into a semi-super physiological range
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:12.080]   or a high-end like 900 to 1000 nanogram per deciliter range.
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.780]   And people always point out, I should mention that,
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:16.000]   oh, well, in certain countries,
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.680]   the high-end range is 1200 nanograms per deciliter.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:19.840]   In the US, it's 900.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.680]   And so if you're 1200, are you really super physiological?
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:27.480]   All that aside, I neglected to ask about that gap in between
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:30.920]   where individuals could think about supplementation,
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:32.480]   meaning non-prescription approaches
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.880]   to increasing testosterone.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:36.600]   And here, we should probably also talk about things like,
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:40.520]   is it true that ice baths increase testosterone or not?
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:43.160]   Lifestyle factors that go beyond the six pillars
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:44.560]   for increasing testosterone.
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.520]   If you could comment on those, that would be terrific,
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:47.920]   supplements that are useful.
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:50.320]   And it'd be wonderful if you could mention
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.600]   where some of these same practices and supplements
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:55.100]   might be useful for women as well as men
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:56.340]   to increase testosterone
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:58.160]   for all the reasons we talked about earlier.
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.000]   - Yeah.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.660]   So this is where a true individualized approach comes in.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:06.480]   When you're talking about what dose of TRT you should be on,
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.520]   one thing to keep in mind
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:09.280]   is the law of diminishing returns.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.880]   Quality of life is a subjective thing
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.480]   and it's different for each person.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:17.520]   So some people are more willing to give up
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.160]   a little bit of athleticism or body composition.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.960]   Some people are more willing to give up
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:26.600]   or not willing to give up libido or sexual health.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.520]   And as we mentioned earlier,
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:32.560]   everybody's androgen receptor is less or more sensitive.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.120]   So you can make a case that if somebody's androgen receptor
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:40.480]   is half as sensitive as somebody else,
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.680]   the person with the less sensitive receptor
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:46.620]   does need a level of 1000 or 1200.
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:47.980]   There's no great way to know that.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:50.240]   And you can alter the sensitivity of your androgen receptor
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:53.080]   with things like L-carnitine and Tidalofil as mentioned.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.720]   - And we'll definitely come back to L-carnitine
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:58.240]   because I'm really intrigued by the data on L-carnitine,
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:01.000]   both for women and men in terms of egg quality,
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.200]   sperm quality, fertility,
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.840]   and a bunch of other interesting effects.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.440]   So we'll come back to L-carnitine.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:09.960]   - But a lot of how you feel the biofeedback or subjective,
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:13.400]   I feel like this comes from the ratio of your androgens
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:14.920]   to your estrogens.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.640]   And a lot of that is lifestyle.
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:18.280]   So if someone's also an HCG,
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.720]   that could upregulate aromatase as well.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.200]   - HCG, you might want to just,
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.040]   human chorionic gonadotropin used to be found in pregnant,
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.560]   is still found in pregnant women's urine.
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.400]   - Still found in pregnant women's.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.280]   - But used to be, believe it or not,
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.540]   there was a black market for pregnant women's urine
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:36.920]   before this stuff was developed synthetically.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:37.760]   So in other words,
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.080]   what we're saying is men typically
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.400]   would buy pregnant women's urine through black markets
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:46.280]   in order to get the HCG,
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:49.960]   in order to get the testosterone enhancing effects of HCG.
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:50.800]   So in other words,
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:52.720]   men were using pregnant women's urine for HCG.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:55.200]   I do not want to know how they got it into their body.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.760]   Let's just skip to what you were going to say next instead.
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:59.940]   - Yeah, so that's HCG.
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:03.200]   There's a lot of other things that upregulate estrogen.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:06.680]   Alcohol significantly increases aromatase.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.260]   So if you're very sensitive to estrogen,
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:11.520]   then you probably shouldn't even consume the two glasses
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:12.560]   three times a week.
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.880]   High fat meals also upregulate aromatase.
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.960]   So if you're on a ketogenic diet,
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.160]   but you have hyper estrogenism,
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.280]   then you should take care with that as well.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:25.720]   - All kinds of fats or just saturated fats?
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.600]   - I'm not sure if it's just saturated fats,
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:31.240]   but fat definitely increases both fat in your body
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.200]   and consumption of a high amount of calories
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.240]   increases aromatase.
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:37.120]   - So it's the ratio of testosterone to estrogen.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.040]   I don't want to break your flow,
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.520]   but since we're talking about fat,
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.640]   I have to ask since estrogen and testosterone
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:44.200]   are both synthesized from the cholesterol molecule,
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:49.580]   I've heard that ingesting some amount of saturated fat
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.840]   can be useful because of the way that cholesterol
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:55.240]   can serve as a precursor to these molecules.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:58.360]   Now, I once said on a podcast that I like butter so much
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.080]   that I occasionally eat pats of butter.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:03.960]   Somehow that got misinterpreted to mean that I eat entire,
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:05.120]   the many pats of butter.
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.460]   I'm talking like one or two pats of butter here and there,
[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:08.780]   and I have no guilt or shame about it.
[01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:11.560]   My blood lipids are in great shape also, so I feel good.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:16.560]   But is it possible that people who are ingesting too little
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.800]   of saturated fats could directly or indirectly reduce
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:24.640]   or somehow disrupt the proper ratio
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:27.080]   of testosterone to estrogen in men and women?
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:28.560]   - It's theoretically possible,
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:31.920]   but it probably doesn't happen in developed countries,
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:33.600]   just like it's theoretically possible
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.320]   to have not enough omega-6 fatty acids,
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.560]   but that probably does not happen in developed countries.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.040]   - So I don't need the butter pats,
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.660]   but I'm going to do it anyway.
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:42.500]   I'm just curious.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:43.340]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:46.500]   - Grass-fed butter has good omega-3 content as well.
[01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:49.800]   So grass-fed foods in general,
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.080]   it's not the end all be all,
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:53.580]   and everybody doesn't need grass-fed foods,
[01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:57.360]   but they are one of the only sources of healthy trans fat.
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:01.300]   So a naturally occurring trans fat comes from ruminants.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:04.440]   So ruminants that I think of like cows
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:09.440]   and the rumination in the different stomachs
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.480]   can change your omega-3 and omega-6
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.840]   to trans linolenic and trans linoleic fatty acids.
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:17.680]   - Which are healthy for us.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.720]   - Yeah, so it's actually omega-3s and omega-6s
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:24.440]   that just happened to have a trans instead of a cis isomer.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:28.240]   - So, and these healthy trans fats would be found
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:32.320]   in ruminant cheese and milk and butter from ruminants
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:35.460]   and the meats? - And the meats, yes.
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:36.800]   - So, and for people who are following
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:40.960]   a purely plant-based diet or mostly plant-based diet,
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:43.540]   are they at risk of not getting enough
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:45.340]   of certain types of fats or other nutrients
[01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:46.800]   to maintain that healthy ratio
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:49.320]   of testosterone to estrogen or not?
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:51.580]   - If they're a vegetarian, they're probably not at risk.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:54.760]   If they're a vegan, they very well could be at risk.
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:59.040]   Most vegans are aware of this very acutely,
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:03.520]   and they'll supplement with, you know, algae,
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:07.700]   or they'll supplement with other sources of healthy fats.
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:08.540]   - I see.
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:10.960]   So the takeaway that I'm drawing from this
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:14.860]   is that less so than getting saturated fat,
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:18.360]   it's key to get these healthy trans fats from ruminants
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:21.040]   or the food products of those ruminants,
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:26.000]   as well as to get proper amounts of omega-3s.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.240]   - And to be clear, you don't need any trans fats.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.560]   It just happens that those omega-3s and omega-6s
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.560]   are in a trans isomer.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.400]   - I see.
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:35.320]   Okay, so that's nutrition.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:38.100]   What other supplements can support healthy testosterone
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:39.680]   to estrogen ratios?
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.540]   - Anything that alters aromatase
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:45.340]   can support healthy testosterone to estrogen.
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:50.340]   And your testosterone to estrogen ratio,
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:53.800]   think about it as how much estrogen activity
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:55.880]   do you have at the beta estradiol receptor
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:57.720]   and your alpha estradiol receptor.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:58.560]   - How would I know that?
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:01.800]   - So it's hard to tell,
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.480]   but depending on what you're eating,
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:06.400]   if you have a lot of plant-based diets or polyphenols,
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:09.540]   many of these are beta estradiol receptors.
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:13.320]   People know about turkestrone and also beta-ectisterone,
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:14.880]   which are two ectisteroids
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:17.680]   that are beta estradiol receptor agonists.
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:20.600]   So they activate the beta estradiol receptor.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.160]   So if you have a very low amount of estrogen naturally,
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:24.800]   you're probably a better candidate for it.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.720]   - For taking to turkestrone or ectisterone.
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:30.800]   - I've never tried them, but I know my understanding
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:34.000]   is that they work tremendously well for some people
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.280]   and not at all for others.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:37.040]   And so one just simply has to try.
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:41.400]   But in promoting the activity of this estrogen receptor,
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.800]   is there a risk that turkestrone or ectisterone
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:46.840]   could cause some of the quote-unquote problems
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:49.800]   associated with increasing estrogen activity,
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.840]   like reduced libido, water retention?
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.440]   - Water retention?
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:58.360]   Yes. Reduced libido, probably not.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.880]   Closing growth plates in the bone?
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.140]   No, because that's the alpha estradiol receptor.
[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:05.600]   - I've talked before on a couple of podcasts
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:09.920]   about tonga ali, which is this Indonesian herb.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.220]   I guess it's also made and found in Malaysia,
[01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:16.480]   but it seems to be the Indonesian variety of tonga ali
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:20.200]   that's most effective for potentially for reducing
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:21.740]   sex hormone and binding globulin
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:24.240]   and thereby freeing up testosterone.
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:26.400]   Whether or not the effects are through that pathway,
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:27.760]   through another pathway,
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:31.560]   a lot of people report improvements in things like libido
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:36.160]   and maybe androgen-like phenotypes, right?
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.680]   Feeling more vital, et cetera.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.560]   And of course, some of that could be placebo, correct?
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:42.600]   But what are your thoughts on tonga ali?
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:45.120]   And please challenge my statements about tonga ali
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:45.940]   if they're incorrect.
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:48.160]   I'm not looking for validation here.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.480]   I just really want to know what your thoughts are on it.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:53.000]   Do you ever recommend it to patients?
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.560]   When men, women, one or the other?
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.360]   - Yeah, so tongkat ali or long jack,
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:02.440]   it has multiple mechanisms of action
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:06.840]   and there have been several placebo-controlled studies on it.
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:09.080]   Some of them show decrease in SHBG.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:12.360]   At least one of them did not show any change in SHBG.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:16.380]   However it is, it does act on aromatase very weakly,
[01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:17.760]   probably not so strongly
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:20.720]   that you would have to be concerned of hypoestrogenism.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.800]   - So it reduces aromatase and thereby can reduce estrogen?
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:25.640]   - Correct. - Okay.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:28.560]   - It's also a weak, it's not a CIRM,
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:31.640]   so it's not a selective estrogen receptor modifier,
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:34.960]   but it's probably a weak, it's probably an ERM as well,
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:38.360]   or a non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.360]   And that should help with decreasing
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:44.280]   negative feedback inhibition of estradiol
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:47.820]   in various locations and also increasing testosterone.
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:48.660]   - Interesting.
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:50.520]   Yeah, the dosage that I've been using for years now
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.080]   is, I think it's 400 milligrams taken once a day,
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.180]   typically early in the day,
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:58.740]   'cause it can kind of have a mild stimulant effect,
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:48:59.580]   very mild.
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:02.560]   And I know that some of the products out there
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:04.360]   recommend dosages that are much higher.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:07.960]   Anytime I've taken more than 400, I don't feel very good.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.440]   I don't know how to describe it
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:11.760]   other than it's just a little over stimulatory
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.920]   in terms of makes me kind of,
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:16.360]   it's like drinking too much coffee.
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.480]   So that's interesting.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.800]   And so would women ever want to take Tonga Ali
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:23.680]   for any reason?
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:25.040]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.760]   So there's a lot of women that have hyper-estrogenism
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.600]   and unlike adrenal fatigue or andropause,
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:35.040]   there's actually ICD-10 codes for hyper-estrogenism.
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.160]   - ICD-10 codes?
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.000]   - Yeah.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:37.820]   - That's doctor speak, right?
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:40.080]   - Yeah, so there's codes to where your doctor
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:41.480]   can actually diagnose you with something.
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.080]   So if you go to your doctor and you say,
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.860]   I have adrenal fatigue, they can't diagnose you with that.
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:47.240]   Or if you say, I have andropause,
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:49.280]   they also can't diagnose you with that.
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:52.860]   But if you say you have hyper-estrogenism,
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:55.040]   the most common complaint that comes with it
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:56.240]   is endometriosis,
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.340]   which is overgrowth of the lining of the uterus.
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:03.360]   And those people could potentially,
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.440]   I think that's one area where we might see
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:09.560]   Tongkat supplementation more and more
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.960]   because not only does it decrease aromatase,
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.660]   like we mentioned, testosterone in females
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:15.800]   is higher than estrogen in females.
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:19.580]   So a lot of females get estrogen from aromatization as well.
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.920]   Peripheral estrogen is sometimes what we call it
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:25.000]   because it's not directly produced in the ovaries,
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.740]   but they could be good candidates for Tongkat
[01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:27.800]   if that's the case.
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:28.640]   - Very interesting.
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.440]   And my understanding is that people should be looking
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:33.460]   for sources of Indonesian Tongkat in particular.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.300]   - Correct.
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:38.120]   Another interesting application is essentially a,
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.080]   I'll call it a PCT, but essentially what that means is,
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:44.400]   PCT means how defined it is, post-cycle therapy.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.460]   - Physicians love acronyms, scientists love acronyms,
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:49.640]   military love acronyms, but yeah, PCT, post-cycle therapy.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.640]   So this would be people coming off hormone therapy
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:52.480]   or steroids.
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.780]   - This would actually be for women that are coming off
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:56.240]   of their birth control pill,
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:59.200]   because perhaps it can help lower that SHBG back to normal,
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.160]   which is sometimes persistently elevated,
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:02.800]   and then it can help prevent
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:05.820]   the subsequent hyper-estrogenism that happens.
[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:07.640]   - Does Tongkat Ali need to be cycled?
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.620]   When I first started taking it, I would cycle it.
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:11.220]   I would do a few, three, four months,
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:12.180]   and I would take some time off.
[01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:14.960]   Now I've just been taking it continuously for years.
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:18.100]   And I should say, I do blood work to check my liver enzymes
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:18.940]   and everything else.
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:23.660]   And I don't see any reason for me to cease taking it.
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:25.820]   - Yeah, probably not.
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:28.620]   There's been human studies on both Tongkat and Fidoja,
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:32.220]   and full disclosure, I did help design Derek's new
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:34.180]   testosterone optimization supplement,
[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:38.140]   which has both Fidoja arrestris and also Tongkat Ali in it.
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:40.400]   - Yeah, let's talk about Fidoja separately in a moment,
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:44.700]   but let's say someone is only taking Tongkat Ali
[01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:48.260]   for whatever reason, but do they need to cycle off?
[01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:51.000]   - Likely not, but I would just to be safe
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.100]   because it does both affect your aromatase
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:57.860]   and it's an estrogen receptor modifier.
[01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:00.980]   - And what would be a reasonable cycle off?
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:03.820]   So how long to take and how long to stop
[01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:04.960]   before taking again?
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:07.860]   - Yeah, there's a couple different protocols
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:10.420]   that you can do, but 11 months on,
[01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:13.180]   one month off for Tongkat is pretty reasonable.
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:15.880]   Now, I guess this is, we'll talk about this later too,
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:17.980]   but if it's combined with Fidoja,
[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:21.300]   the protocol that I would do is three weeks on,
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:23.060]   one week off.
[01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:25.840]   - So that's Tongkat Ali, but I'm curious
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:28.360]   what your thoughts are on Fidoja aggressis,
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:32.740]   this Nigerian shrub or this extract from Nigerian shrubs
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:34.340]   that at least in my experience,
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:36.980]   in my read of the literature has the potential
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:40.680]   to increase testosterone and probably other hormones as well
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:42.860]   by way of increasing luteinizing hormone,
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:44.780]   something that we haven't really talked about much
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:45.880]   up until now.
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:48.380]   What are your thoughts about Fidoja aggressis?
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:51.240]   What are your ideas about the proposed mechanism
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:55.060]   or mechanisms and where might this be useful
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:53:00.060]   for people on or off hormone replacement therapy?
[01:53:00.060 --> 01:53:04.460]   - Yeah, Fidoja aggressis has just reached a point
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:06.660]   where we have enough evidence to we know
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:10.340]   it probably helps both with luteinizing hormone release,
[01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:12.340]   which stimulates latex cells in the testes
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:14.140]   to produce more testosterone
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:18.900]   and probably with LH receptor sensitivity as well,
[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:20.860]   which is a good combination of the two.
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:24.480]   It does come from the Nigerian shrub,
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:27.860]   but there is not quite enough evidence
[01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:30.620]   for me to be able to say,
[01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:33.340]   it's safe for somebody to take this all the time,
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:35.040]   which again, full disclosure,
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.020]   that's why I recommended that we,
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:41.700]   recommended for people to cycle this supplement.
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:46.480]   So three weeks on, one week off, that's likely safe.
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:49.640]   The only toxicity studies in general are in rats
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:51.620]   and in humans, it looks quite safe.
[01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:55.340]   - My understanding is that the toxicity studies in rats
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:59.780]   showed toxicity to the testicular cells.
[01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:01.180]   So that's certainly concerning,
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:04.140]   but that the dosages that were used
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:07.500]   or translating the dosages used to humans
[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:09.900]   would lead to a situation where the dosages
[01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:12.460]   that humans would have to take would be very, very large.
[01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:15.780]   So the amount of, I no longer take Fidogia,
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:19.080]   but I took it at 600 milligrams per day for a long time.
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:22.300]   And I ceased taking it because I was experimenting
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:25.500]   with other things and I didn't want to confound those things,
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.800]   not because I had any negative side effects.
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:29.360]   In fact, I was monitoring blood work
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:33.180]   and other biological parameters that would have told me
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:35.820]   if there was testicular toxicity and there wasn't,
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:36.900]   let's put it that way.
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:38.440]   - Yeah, I think it's extremely safe.
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:41.820]   And I'm just not convinced
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:44.220]   that there's enough overwhelming evidence
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:48.780]   for long-term consistent administration.
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:50.940]   - So do you recommend this to people
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:53.380]   who are not taking TRT?
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:55.540]   And do you recommend to men and women?
[01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:58.660]   - Yeah, so if you have a really high LH,
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:01.300]   then there's probably a gonadal issue,
[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:05.240]   whether it's heat damage to the testes, a varicocele,
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:06.740]   a history of testicular cancer,
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.200]   where your LH is gonna be higher.
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:11.260]   So if your LH is already very high,
[01:55:11.260 --> 01:55:14.020]   increasing it even more is probably not gonna help.
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:16.100]   However, if your LH is low,
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:18.300]   then obviously try to find out if it is low.
[01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:20.940]   Is it deficient or is it just a little bit low?
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:23.340]   If it's low and you don't have an issue with prolactin,
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:26.880]   you don't have an issue with opioid receptor antagonism,
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:29.660]   then naltrexone can actually potentially help antagonize
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:31.260]   that to increase LH as well,
[01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:34.380]   especially in people recovering from opiates
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:36.380]   or likely even alcohol.
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:39.540]   So you're looking for a subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
[01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:41.960]   which is essentially, just think of that as low LH.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:45.820]   So in people with that lower LH and their estrogen is fine
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:48.120]   and their prolactin is fine,
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.660]   then Fidogia is a particularly good option.
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:54.500]   - Interesting, so three weeks on, one week off,
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.860]   for 600 milligrams Fidogia,
[01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:00.900]   400 milligrams Tonga Ali, Indonesian Tonga Ali,
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:03.220]   could potentially be good.
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:04.400]   And of course, everyone should always check
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:07.120]   with their physician, clear this, do blood work, et cetera.
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:09.120]   I would say, we don't just say that to protect us.
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:11.100]   We say that to protect you,
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:15.460]   meaning that the consumer is very, very important.
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:16.740]   You don't want to get,
[01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:18.860]   you don't want to fly blind with any of this stuff.
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:20.300]   You want to do blood work, right?
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:21.980]   - That's the catch-22 with supplements
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:24.160]   is most of them are safer than medications,
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:26.500]   but the only difference between them and a medication
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.700]   is one's prescribed and one's not.
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:30.100]   - And oftentimes with supplements,
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:32.420]   it's unclear whether or not what's listed on the bottle
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:33.700]   is actually what's in the bottle.
[01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:37.140]   But I think there are a number of reputable brands now.
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:41.360]   The other supplement I want to talk about
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:44.620]   in terms of testosterone augmentation is Boron.
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:46.580]   What is Boron thought to do?
[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:47.920]   Does it actually do that?
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:50.400]   And do you ever recommend Boron?
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:53.300]   - Yeah, so Boron is actually an element
[01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:55.880]   and you can find it on the periodic table.
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:59.100]   It's more plentiful in rich soils.
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:03.120]   So frequent farming can deplete the soils of Boron.
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:04.960]   It's very plentiful in the Mediterranean area,
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:06.440]   like Greece and Turkey.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:09.420]   So a lot of people will just eat dates or raisins
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:10.260]   that are grown there.
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:11.460]   - I thought you were going to tell me people eat dirt,
[01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:12.580]   but there are people who eat dirt.
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:13.420]   - There are people who eat dirt.
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:15.880]   - There's a phenomenon called pica, right?
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:19.240]   Where people in a, and that's not a good thing.
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:21.100]   - Often a sign of iron deficiency.
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:23.340]   - Okay, but they're eating grapes and dates
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:26.360]   that were grown in soil that has high amounts of Boron.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:30.300]   - Yeah, so Boron can help regulate SHBG,
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.680]   but its effect is mostly acute.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:36.040]   So it's unlikely to have a bad effect.
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:37.320]   So a lot of people take Boron
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:39.520]   because it's probably not going to hurt
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:42.120]   and it will lower SHBG,
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:45.400]   even if it is for a short period of time.
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:46.440]   So I guess you can make a case
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:48.800]   that maybe cycling Boron can help too.
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:51.280]   - What sorts of dosages are useful
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:52.860]   for Boron supplementation?
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:55.140]   - Three to six milligrams, once to twice a day.
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:55.980]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:58.600]   So that's higher than the amounts that I've been taking.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:02.040]   I've long been doing this cocktail of Tonga Ali.
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:03.560]   Again, I stopped taking Fidogia,
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:07.120]   but for a long time with Fidogia and Boron,
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:08.880]   I think it was two to four milligrams per day,
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:10.440]   but maybe I could afford to go higher.
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:13.500]   Although my blood work is where I want it, thankfully.
[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:15.920]   Sort of circling back to Fidogia.
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:19.140]   Fidogia was attractive to me as a supplement
[01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:21.420]   because I saw increases in LH,
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:23.520]   testosterone and free testosterone.
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:25.360]   My estrogen stayed in check,
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:29.600]   but I also did not see a downregulation of LH
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:31.640]   when I would cycle off.
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:35.600]   Whereas with HCG, human cortionic gonadotropin,
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:39.880]   which does now arrive in forms
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:41.740]   not from pregnant women's urine only,
[01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:43.980]   but the synthetic forms that people inject,
[01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:45.040]   that, as I understand it,
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:49.100]   can actually suppress endogenous hormone output
[01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:50.580]   if one takes it for a long period of time.
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:54.080]   So why would a man or woman want to take HCG
[01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:58.280]   and what are the potential risks and benefits of taking HCG?
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:01.800]   - Yeah, so HCG or human cortionic gonadotropin
[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:04.660]   is actually very similar to TSH.
[01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:06.100]   - Thyroid-stimulating hormone.
[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:07.100]   - Correct.
[01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:11.980]   So when a woman is pregnant, she produces more HCG,
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:14.120]   especially in the first trimester.
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:15.440]   When you take a pregnancy test,
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:17.860]   whether it's qualitative or quantitative,
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:19.880]   you see the HCG rise
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:22.720]   and it actually doubles every 48 hours.
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:26.260]   So if you're five weeks pregnant, you can get an HCG level.
[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:29.040]   And then two days later, five weeks and two days,
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.200]   you can see your HCG
[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:33.220]   and maybe it went from 500 to 1,000.
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:36.020]   So it precipitously increases.
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:39.060]   It does a few things.
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:42.040]   One thing is it prevents hypothyroidism
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:44.820]   or hypothyroxemia of pregnancy,
[01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:48.260]   which is one of the most common causes of miscarriage.
[01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:52.740]   It's also why if you have hypothyroidism
[01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:54.920]   and you get pregnant in the first trimester,
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:58.840]   you wanna increase your dose from 25 to 40%
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:02.200]   to keep your free T4 high as much as possible.
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:04.060]   And the reason why you have to do that
[02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:07.360]   as opposed to somebody who does not have hypothyroidism
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:08.860]   is if you have hypothyroidism,
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:11.780]   then likely your thyroid will not respond
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:15.480]   to either TSH or HCG.
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:18.780]   So the increased HCG does not compensate for that.
[02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:20.820]   So if you take HCG,
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:23.580]   then it can potentially improve your thyroid function.
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:26.920]   So that along with selenium are likely the two best things
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:28.500]   that you can do for thyroid health.
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:30.200]   - HCG and selenium?
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:33.020]   Well, I definitely make sure I get enough selenium
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:36.980]   by eating three to five Brazil nuts per day,
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:39.160]   which I very much enjoy the taste of also.
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:42.380]   Who should take HCG
[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:47.020]   and can HCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output?
[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:51.060]   - Yeah, it suppresses LH in a dose dependent manner.
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:53.940]   So the higher the dose of HCG you take,
[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:55.500]   the more it suppresses LH.
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:57.500]   A common dose for fertility,
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:00.100]   fertility is usually why HCG is prescribed.
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:01.060]   - In men or women?
[02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:06.060]   - In both, is 10,000 IUs all at one time,
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:07.580]   which is quite a bit.
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:10.040]   - That's a tremendous dose.
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:11.860]   - Yeah, in fact, some formulation,
[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:15.820]   some brand names of HCG come in auto-injector pins
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:17.320]   to where you cannot even dose
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:19.660]   lower than 5,000 units at a time.
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:22.740]   - Wow, but I know a number of people who take HCG
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:26.700]   to maintain testicular function while on testosterone therapy
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:28.340]   or augmentation of some sort.
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:30.580]   Does it work to do that?
[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:34.460]   - Yeah, some people are on HCG monotherapy.
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:39.460]   It can be slightly better on your lipids than being on TRT.
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:44.980]   - So people are using HCG alone as a kind of neither,
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:48.260]   sort of a hormone augment, indirect hormone augmentation.
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:53.260]   - Some clinics advertise it as a non-suppressive
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:56.500]   alternative to TRT, but it is suppressive of LH.
[02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:58.940]   - But it could also increase estrogen pretty potently.
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:01:59.780]   - Yeah.
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:04.500]   - And is it true that increasing LH and or HCG
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:08.340]   can improve sensitivity of the genitals?
[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:09.900]   And is that true for men and women?
[02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:11.060]   I've heard this anecdotally.
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:14.200]   People say HCG makes sexual activity
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:17.060]   more pleasurable for people because of some,
[02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:20.300]   is it a direct effect on some of the nerve cells
[02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:21.860]   in the genitals?
[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:26.380]   - Yeah, so LH is also an agonist in the prostate
[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:29.140]   and in genital tissue in general.
[02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:32.400]   So it's a very common treatment
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:36.220]   for post-phenasteride syndrome or post-5-alpha reductase.
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:39.660]   When you've blocked the conversion of DHT for a long time,
[02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:42.580]   it helps re-upregulate DHT.
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:44.420]   - So someone who's been taking phenasteride
[02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:46.420]   to prevent hair loss comes off,
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:49.100]   it feels maybe because they felt lousy,
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:50.540]   but then feels even lousier
[02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:52.060]   for reasons that you talked about earlier.
[02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:55.560]   And then they might use HCG as a transition treatment
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:58.980]   to transition back to normal hormone health.
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:02:59.820]   Is that right?
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:02.240]   - It's extremely helpful in many cases.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:03.580]   Now, when you come off the HCG,
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:06.160]   then you need to have a strategy of how to return
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:08.600]   to your normal as fast as possible as well,
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:11.540]   but it will upregulate those 5-alpha reductase enzymes.
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:13.120]   You have in your genital skin,
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:17.180]   both scretal skin and penile skin and perineum in general,
[02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:20.260]   you have, I believe what's called stratum lucidum.
[02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:24.020]   It's a skin layer that is very, very thin,
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:28.420]   but it has the highest concentration of 5-alpha reductase.
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:30.820]   So you have a lot of activity
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:35.800]   and after you've been on something that inhibits the enzyme,
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:38.220]   the 5-AR enzyme in those tissues,
[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:41.460]   then you do something else to upregulate those enzymes,
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:43.620]   whether it's waiting and taking time,
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:45.420]   whether it's trying Tidalafil,
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:47.960]   whether it's trying creatine even,
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:50.300]   or whether it's trying HCG,
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:51.700]   a lot of times those are the go-tos
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:53.400]   for post-fenasteride syndrome.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:56.080]   - Any risks for women taking HCG
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:01.980]   on their ability to get pregnant or risk generally?
[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:05.240]   - Yeah, obviously it'll make any pregnancy test positive.
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:07.720]   So that's a risk that some women don't know.
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:09.900]   - So one could in theory fake a pregnancy test
[02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:10.980]   by injecting HCG?
[02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:11.860]   - Absolutely.
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:12.700]   - Interesting.
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:13.520]   - Yeah.
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:15.660]   - I have no motivation to do that.
[02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:16.700]   I was just curious.
[02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:19.300]   - Yeah.
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:21.540]   - What about prolactin?
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:24.660]   You know, the simple version of this that I was taught
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:26.020]   because I was taught mainly
[02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:28.820]   from the neuroendocrine perspective was, you know,
[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:31.140]   dopamine is a kind of close cousin of testosterone
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:34.260]   and also estrogen for that matter drives a repetitive
[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:38.400]   behaviors, including pursuit of sexual partner sex itself,
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:40.160]   motivated behaviors generally.
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:45.160]   Then post-copulatory, post-orgasmic states are accompanied
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:46.960]   by a prolactin increase.
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:48.920]   That's the refractory period for mating in males
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:51.520]   and maybe even in females as well,
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:54.000]   involved in milk letdown, et cetera.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.280]   What are sort of the general contours of syndromes
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:59.360]   or things that people could be on the lookout for
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:03.280]   of having too much prolactin or too little prolactin?
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:06.460]   And I'm aware of a number of people who take
[02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:10.120]   a dopamine agonist, L-tyrosine, cabergoline,
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:13.060]   things like that to really boost their dopamine levels.
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:15.540]   And that isn't always a good thing as it turns out.
[02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:18.260]   Oftentimes people will become kind of hyper dopaminergic.
[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:20.280]   And so they have the drive to do all these
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:23.020]   repetitive things, you know, fill in the blanks,
[02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:26.180]   but they don't always have the ability because it seems
[02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:27.960]   just as testosterone and estrogen need to be
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:30.320]   in the proper ratios, dopamine and prolactin
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:32.320]   need to be in the appropriate ratios.
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:35.440]   How should we think about and perhaps act
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:37.520]   on our prolactin systems?
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:38.760]   - Absolutely.
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:41.480]   The way I describe it is the dopamine wave pool.
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:44.200]   So if you're increasing your dopamine too much,
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:46.260]   you're going to overflow and then you're going to have
[02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:47.960]   that wave crash too much.
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:50.920]   So you want to have nice even waves that are not going
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:53.200]   too far above the pool of dopamine
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:55.040]   and prolactin will follow.
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:58.180]   So prolactin and estrogen are quite close cousins.
[02:05:58.180 --> 02:06:01.560]   Estrogen upregulates a gene called the PRL gene
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:04.760]   or prolactin gene that directly increases
[02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:06.840]   prolactin synthesis.
[02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:11.840]   So prolactin is going to also inhibit the release
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:14.880]   of testosterone from the pituitary.
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:17.480]   So if you're using a dopamine agonist,
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:21.660]   then you're going to help decrease the prolactin producing
[02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:23.960]   cells, including if you have a prolactin producing
[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:26.200]   micro adenoma in the pituitary.
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:27.100]   - How common are those?
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:29.720]   Because I mean, I hear a lot about these, you know,
[02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:32.880]   hypogonadism or, and of course that can be due to an issue
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:37.880]   at the testicles or hypogonadism could also be of course,
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:40.560]   in like ovarian syndromes.
[02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:42.200]   And then there's of course the brain side of it,
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:43.720]   where the signals aren't coming from the brain.
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:45.720]   You're not enough gonadotropin,
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:47.160]   not enough luteinizing hormone.
[02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:49.300]   And there are ways of teasing this apart through with an
[02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:51.360]   endocrinologist that are quite elegant in fact, right?
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:54.000]   Using stimulating hormones, too much to dive into here,
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.160]   but how often does one actually have one of these pituitary
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:06:59.240]   tumors?
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:03.180]   I have heard that people that play a lot of high contact
[02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:05.680]   sports, so boxing, football,
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:08.240]   people that head headed the soccer ball quite a lot.
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:13.960]   Sadly, people whose jobs forced them to take head blows for,
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:15.260]   you know, it could be military.
[02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:16.460]   And so they were firing, you know,
[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:19.200]   50 caliber guns and the kind of woodpeckering of the brain
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:22.760]   inside of the skull and construction workers,
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:26.020]   or just a concussion can cause the pituitary to go
[02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:30.100]   malfunctional, is that really common or is this something
[02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:33.340]   that, you know, is, is a rare, like 1%?
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:34.920]   - Yeah, it's extremely common.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.580]   It's another one of those conditions where a lot of people
[02:07:37.580 --> 02:07:39.020]   never know they have it.
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:40.940]   They just feel a little bit more fatigued.
[02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:44.660]   They have that high prolactin feeling all the time,
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:47.880]   but pituitary micro adenomas can be non-producing as well.
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:49.960]   So your prolactin can be totally normal.
[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:52.180]   Your growth hormone and IGF-1 can be totally normal.
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.920]   That's the second most common producing micro adenomas
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:57.440]   growth hormone, causing either acromegaly,
[02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:59.840]   which is growth of cartilage or gigantism.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:02.880]   - This is the big brow, yeah.
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:05.720]   - So those are fairly common causes of adenomas,
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:09.600]   but a lot of people that have a very small adenoma,
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:11.960]   you know, much less than one centimeter,
[02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:13.520]   it's hard to see on imaging,
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:16.960]   even if you have a contrast that specifically looks
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:20.720]   at the pituitary and many people aren't symptomatic.
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:25.720]   So it's one of those things along with PCOS and prediabetes
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:29.960]   that are much more frequent when it comes to prevalence,
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:32.720]   which is the amount, the percentage of people
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:35.120]   that have it in the general population.
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:37.020]   - I'm glad you mentioned the dopamine wave pool.
[02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:39.240]   I know nowadays there's a lot of interest
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:40.720]   in augmenting dopamine.
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:42.880]   I know a number of people that do this
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:46.160]   through prescription drugs, Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil,
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:48.300]   and those drugs of course hit many transmitter systems,
[02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:49.840]   but dopamine is certainly involved.
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:53.040]   People taking antidepressants like wellbutrin,
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:55.000]   tap into that system.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.440]   And of course, people are trying to inhibit prolactin
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:01.140]   and promote serotonin or reduce serotonin.
[02:09:01.140 --> 02:09:04.460]   To me, it all seems like a very delicate dance, right?
[02:09:04.460 --> 02:09:07.560]   I mean, to just imagine the arousal arc
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:10.600]   for mating behavior, for sexual reproduction
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:14.000]   is such an elaborate dance between sympathetic drive
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.120]   and parasympathetic drive,
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.660]   even with across the span of minutes, right?
[02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:19.320]   I mean, I've talked about this before in the podcast
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:23.100]   that the arousal is kind of more parasympathetic.
[02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:26.240]   Orgasm in itself is a sympathetic response,
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:28.080]   a completely different set of neurons.
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:31.520]   And so where do you see people getting into trouble
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:34.600]   just trying to hit the gas pedal on dopamine?
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:37.040]   And where do you think there is a place for people
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:39.840]   who perhaps are experiencing low drive and motivation,
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:42.360]   not just sexual, but in general,
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:44.760]   to increase the amount of dopamine circulating
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:45.960]   in their brain and body?
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:49.440]   How do you think about that given this wave pool analogy?
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:51.420]   - Yeah, so it's important to parse it out
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:55.220]   and start with the least powerful interventions.
[02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:57.340]   So if someone's concerned about dopamine,
[02:09:57.340 --> 02:09:59.960]   or maybe they have a slightly higher prolactin,
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:01.000]   then they eliminate things
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.540]   that could be increasing that prolactin.
[02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:06.640]   So casein or gluten,
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:09.360]   which are mu opioid receptor agonists,
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:12.480]   or any mu opioid receptor agonist in the gut.
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:14.360]   - So casein, so milk protein?
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:16.100]   - Correct. - Can increase prolactin?
[02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:17.200]   - Correct.
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:18.040]   - Interesting.
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:20.000]   - In addition to that, they should,
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.200]   if they need a pituitary MRI,
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:23.840]   then they should get a pituitary MRI.
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:25.200]   If they don't have an adenoma,
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:27.480]   or if they don't have a high enough prolactin level
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:29.640]   to where they need an MRI,
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:31.060]   if they're having visual symptoms,
[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:33.920]   or if they're having olfactory symptoms with the nose,
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:36.800]   then it's more likely that they do.
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:39.680]   But if they don't, a lot of times a prolactin
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:42.720]   under about 40 is not too big of a deal.
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:44.760]   They can take dopamine agonists
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:47.840]   that agonize that D2 receptor, like P5P,
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.020]   which is essentially vitamin B6.
[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:53.400]   It's pyridoxine, five pyrophosphate,
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:55.720]   and pyridoxine is vitamin B6.
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:59.480]   So that can help, 50 milligrams once to twice a day.
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:01.460]   Vitamin E can also help,
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:03.660]   especially if it's mixed to Cofarols.
[02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:07.540]   A lot of people have the high levels of vitamin E,
[02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:11.060]   but low levels of the gamma form of vitamin E.
[02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:12.200]   So that can also help.
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:13.040]   - Fascinating.
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:16.020]   I'm so glad you mentioned vitamin B6 and P5P.
[02:11:16.020 --> 02:11:21.580]   I have heard that one can shorten the refractory period
[02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:26.580]   after orgasm, essentially to be able to have sex again,
[02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:27.960]   to be quite direct about it,
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:32.880]   by way of vitamin B6 blunting of the prolactin response,
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:35.440]   which turns out to be quite potent.
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:38.320]   But I've also heard that vitamin B6 can be neurotoxic,
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:39.600]   especially in the periphery,
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:41.160]   that it can cause peripheral neuropathies
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:42.760]   if it's taken at high doses,
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:45.600]   but that P5P is the safer form.
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.000]   Is that true?
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.960]   - It's pre-activated, so it does not build up.
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:55.320]   Think of it as a allegory to how folate can build up.
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:59.320]   It's not a methyl folate, but it builds up
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:01.700]   and it can increase levels of homocysteine.
[02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:03.600]   Or if you have too much vitamin B12,
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:05.600]   another water-soluble B vitamin,
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:08.820]   you can have too much methylmalonic acid or MMA.
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:11.520]   So depending on what your enzymatic conversion is
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.460]   to the active form of the enzyme,
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:17.200]   often it's just safer to take the active form of the enzyme.
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:18.240]   - Very interesting.
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:22.180]   Okay, well, at risk of going down every hormonal pathway
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:24.800]   and talking about supplementation lifestyle factors,
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:26.620]   I think touching on, as we have,
[02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:29.300]   testosterone and estrogen and now prolactin,
[02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:32.120]   I'd love to chat a little bit about L-carnitine.
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:33.860]   We talked about this earlier,
[02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:37.040]   but I want to raise this discussion about L-carnitine,
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:39.340]   not in the context of L-carnitine itself,
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:42.060]   but in the context of fertility.
[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:45.300]   Because my read of the literature is that L-carnitine
[02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:48.680]   can be very beneficial for enhancing sperm quality
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:51.700]   and egg quality and even rates of conception.
[02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:55.220]   What forms does L-carnitine come in
[02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:57.900]   that people can reasonably consider?
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:00.580]   Again, talk to your doctor folks.
[02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:03.580]   What is it doing and do we know how it's doing it?
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:06.540]   And do you often use this in your patients?
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:10.340]   - Yeah, so the way I think about L-carnitine,
[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:12.380]   and I'll try to tie this in with creatine
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:14.000]   and other things as well,
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.400]   is if your cell is an energy factory or a car,
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:22.400]   then L-carnitine is the shuttle that helps get the fuel
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:24.260]   into the motor to use the motor.
[02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:27.240]   The motor is mostly due to lifestyle factors,
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:30.600]   so like your diet and your exercise.
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:34.600]   And the type of fuel itself is NAD+.
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:36.860]   We don't need to get into NAD precursors or NMN
[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:38.480]   or NR or anything.
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:42.020]   And then the accessory fuel tank is your creatine phosphate.
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:44.560]   So creatine is your accessory fuel tank.
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:47.080]   Your NAD status, which is largely determined
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:50.000]   by your REM sleep and quality sleep and exercise,
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.320]   along with supplementation is the fuel.
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:57.320]   The carnitine shuttle is carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A,
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:59.760]   and that takes medium chain fatty acids.
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:01.840]   It takes different molecules of fat.
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:04.520]   You have two main energy sources other than ketones.
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:06.120]   You have your glucose or carbs.
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:08.360]   You have your fat or fatty acids.
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:12.380]   And that takes it across the layer of the mitochondria
[02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:13.960]   so that it can be utilized.
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:15.700]   So upregulates that.
[02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:18.880]   That's why things that have flagella in general,
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:21.240]   the flagella are going to work better, like sperm.
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:22.320]   - Flagella being anything,
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:24.960]   sort of the wavy little tendrils on cell types,
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:27.120]   of which they're everywhere, right, in the gut too, right?
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:27.960]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:30.240]   - So those are going to work significantly better.
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:32.880]   And in general, your mitochondria are going to work better.
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:35.440]   So the worse your mitochondria are off the bat,
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:38.500]   the better they're going to be helped by the shuttle
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:40.320]   that shuttles them across.
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:42.700]   It also slightly increases the density
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:45.000]   of the androgen receptor as well.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.020]   - Is that a local effect?
[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:48.540]   So if L-carnitine is injected into a particular muscle,
[02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:50.360]   will it increase the density of androgen receptors
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:51.480]   in that muscle?
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:52.480]   - Likely so.
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:54.160]   - So how are people taking L-carnitine?
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:56.600]   Their capsule forms and their injectable forms?
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:59.020]   Most people are going to be taking the capsule forms
[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:01.000]   because that's all they're going to have access to.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.960]   And then we should also ask, can you get L-carnitine
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:04.020]   from food?
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:04.860]   - Yeah.
[02:15:04.860 --> 02:15:08.600]   So L-carnitine is just a combination of,
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.380]   it's actually a very small peptide.
[02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:13.960]   So glutathione is just three amino acids.
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:16.840]   L-carnitine is the smallest peptide, two.
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:19.460]   So peptide is just a protein that has amino acids
[02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:21.680]   between two and about 200.
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:24.560]   And L-carnitine is just two amino acids.
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:25.400]   - Amazing.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:27.240]   So it's like a micropeptide.
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:29.480]   - Yeah, so your body synthesizes enough.
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:32.120]   It likes to absorb the amino acids by themselves.
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:35.800]   And then if it puts them together, there it makes L-carnitine.
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:38.480]   It's not very bioavailable if you take it.
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:40.620]   A lot of people will take L-carnitine L-tartrate
[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:45.220]   or acyl L-carnitine, and that's about 10% bioavailable.
[02:15:45.220 --> 02:15:48.040]   So if you want one gram or a thousand milligrams
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:51.640]   of L-carnitine, you can take 10 grams of oral L-carnitine.
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:54.580]   - Is the one gram, the typical dose you recommend,
[02:15:54.580 --> 02:15:56.000]   one gram per day?
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.720]   - For fertility and androgen receptor upregulation.
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:01.480]   So that means taking 10 grams of the capsule form.
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:05.760]   - Yeah, so that's about 15 to 20 capsules, which is a lot.
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:06.600]   - That is a lot.
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:08.500]   - It can also potentially increase TMAO.
[02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:09.600]   - Yeah, I wanted to ask about that
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:14.360]   because TMAO on your blood chart, when that's elevated,
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:16.280]   that's going to cause some concern.
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:17.880]   You taught me a trick, however,
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:22.880]   that one can take 600 milligrams of garlic capsule
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:24.600]   for the allicin, is that what it's called?
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:25.440]   - Allicin is in it, yeah.
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:27.280]   - It's like the name allicin, but with two Ls?
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:28.120]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:33.360]   And that had a remarkable effect in reducing TMAO.
[02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:34.680]   So that's quite potent.
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:38.440]   And also, was it just coincidence
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:41.940]   that it really brought my LDL down as well?
[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:45.240]   - I'm not sure if the LDL is a coincidence,
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:49.880]   but depending on your gut microbiome or your microbiota,
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:54.160]   some microbiome beneficial bacteria
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:57.620]   will convert carnitine and also choline.
[02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:00.000]   So any choline precursor like alpha GPC
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.580]   or phosphatidylserine,
[02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:04.500]   it will convert them more or less to TMAO.
[02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:06.280]   So TMAO is something that you can get measured
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:08.600]   in a blood test and see if it's high or low.
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:11.100]   Some people might not even need allicin.
[02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:11.940]   - Interesting. - Some people
[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:12.840]   do benefit from it.
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:13.680]   - Interesting.
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:16.800]   Although I think it was you that also told me
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:19.220]   that allicin and garlic can have positive effects
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:22.400]   on cardiovascular tone and blood flow generally.
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.600]   Is that right? - Yeah.
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:26.500]   - Okay, so maybe, so it's 600 milligrams garlic
[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:29.640]   in excessive amount, or can I just eat garlic?
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:30.480]   - You can just eat. - I mean,
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:31.760]   I like eating garlic. - Yeah.
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:34.600]   - Yeah, so, okay, so one could also just eat garlic.
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:37.640]   If one were going to take allicin in injectable form,
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:39.920]   how much of that is bioavailable?
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:41.960]   - 100% if you inject it.
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:44.040]   It is in an aqueous solution.
[02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:47.040]   So it's a bacteriostatic water essentially.
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:49.400]   So it's not in a carrier oil.
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:51.400]   So it really, it's going to burn a lot
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:53.480]   if you inject it subcutaneously.
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:57.460]   So it's going to be absorbed faster and more evenly
[02:17:57.460 --> 02:17:59.360]   and also just hurt a lot less
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:01.360]   if you inject it into a muscle.
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:05.420]   - But one could then just take one gram per day injected
[02:18:05.420 --> 02:18:07.060]   or divide it up into a couple of doses.
[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:07.980]   - Yeah, or 500.
[02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:10.700]   The minimally efficacious dose for injectables,
[02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:14.700]   probably around 200 when it comes to sperm motility
[02:18:14.700 --> 02:18:16.940]   and the androgen receptor upregulation.
[02:18:16.940 --> 02:18:19.580]   So it really depends on why you're taking it.
[02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:21.620]   - In terms of fertility and in terms of blood tests,
[02:18:21.620 --> 02:18:26.620]   generally, you know, I always say that if possible,
[02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:32.260]   either by way of insurance or by way of some other way,
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:34.580]   affording it, it would be great for people
[02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:37.360]   to have blood tests to know what their hormone levels
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:39.820]   and other levels of other things like metabolic markers
[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:43.120]   and lipids were in their 20s, also in their 30s,
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:43.960]   also in their 40s.
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:46.220]   I think there's this idea that you only take a blood test
[02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:47.420]   when you have a problem.
[02:18:47.420 --> 02:18:51.700]   But then of course, one can't actually do the comparison
[02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:53.700]   that you mentioned earlier or state the comparison
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:57.580]   to one's physician that things are changing over time.
[02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:00.620]   And it seems to me that basically everyone should get
[02:19:00.620 --> 02:19:02.540]   at least a once a year blood test.
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:05.620]   Is there the hope that insurance will someday just cover it
[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:07.280]   for everybody, this will be standard care?
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:10.500]   I would think that everybody should know what sorts
[02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:12.140]   of things are floating around in their bloodstream
[02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:14.740]   and what they need more of and less of in life.
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:17.940]   I doubt it will ever be covered by insurance.
[02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:21.300]   In many cases, you could make an argument that it's indicated
[02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:24.640]   as insurance begins to cover more of the population
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:29.640]   for pathologies, the things like FSAs or HSAs,
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:34.420]   your care credit will likely cover this advanced testing,
[02:19:34.420 --> 02:19:37.500]   which it continues to come down and down in price.
[02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:40.020]   So it'll be affordable, but it won't be free.
[02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:41.400]   - Got it. - Yeah.
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:42.640]   - I'd like to shift gears slightly
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:46.220]   and talk about social interactions
[02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:48.900]   and relational effects on hormones.
[02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:50.660]   Something that I just find fascinating.
[02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:52.040]   We touched on this a little bit earlier
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:53.480]   with in terms of oral contraception,
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:55.360]   but now that we have the backdrop
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:57.280]   of what these various hormones do,
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:19:59.320]   some involvement in neurotransmitter systems
[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:02.640]   like dopamine and prolactin and associated pathways,
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:04.840]   prolactin of course being a hormone, not a neurotransmitter,
[02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:09.800]   but there's a phenomenon in human beings
[02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:13.260]   where people get very excited about a new partner
[02:20:13.260 --> 02:20:16.700]   and that excitement no doubt is related
[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:18.980]   to the dopamine system among other systems.
[02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:21.100]   And that excitement can be maintained
[02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:22.340]   or can wane over time.
[02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:23.620]   And here I'm talking about attraction,
[02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:25.460]   but I'm also talking about just general excitement
[02:20:25.460 --> 02:20:26.440]   in the sense of novelty,
[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:29.380]   because that's what dopamine is associated with.
[02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:33.500]   Given that you work with human beings
[02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:36.560]   and they have lives and relationships and lifestyles,
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:39.260]   and they have hormones and all these things interact,
[02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:41.040]   what are some of the ways that we could think
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:45.920]   about adjusting our relationships
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:48.100]   in order to optimize hormones,
[02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:51.500]   as opposed to just thinking about how to optimize hormones
[02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:52.620]   for sake of our relationship?
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:55.080]   Because it's bi-directional, of course.
[02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:57.900]   And this assumes, I should say,
[02:20:57.900 --> 02:20:59.900]   that one is already paying attention
[02:20:59.900 --> 02:21:02.340]   to the six pillars talked about earlier
[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:04.460]   that people are doing most things right.
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:07.140]   How should we think about relationships and hormones?
[02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:08.740]   Friendships, romantic relationships,
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:11.100]   new partners, long-term partners.
[02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:15.100]   How do you think about this kind of stuff?
[02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:18.460]   - Yeah, so if you have a new partner,
[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:22.180]   then it is largely regulated by the dopaminergic system,
[02:21:22.180 --> 02:21:23.500]   which changes over time.
[02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:25.380]   So people may have heard the saying
[02:21:25.380 --> 02:21:28.200]   that you have to go through a full calendar year
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:29.900]   with someone that you're in a relationship so that you-
[02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:30.740]   - Very good advice, by the way.
[02:21:30.740 --> 02:21:34.780]   - So that you really know what to do and what not to do.
[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:37.940]   But because you experience both of your families
[02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:40.220]   and the holidays and all the different situations,
[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:44.460]   but I would argue until you have moved in together,
[02:21:44.460 --> 02:21:46.780]   had a baby, and then raised that baby,
[02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:48.740]   preferably breastfeeding,
[02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:50.780]   because that's when you get the prolactin spikes,
[02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:54.100]   you aren't really gone through every stage in life yet.
[02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:55.020]   Now, you can't really do that
[02:21:55.020 --> 02:21:56.560]   with every person that you're considering.
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:57.460]   - Well, some people do,
[02:21:57.460 --> 02:22:01.500]   but it can be quite costly in terms of time and finances
[02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:02.880]   and emotionally costly.
[02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:05.360]   And then here, I'm definitely not referring
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:07.960]   to any personal experience of having done all that
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:08.800]   many times over,
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:13.800]   but what would you suggest people do or think about
[02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:16.220]   as they enter relationship,
[02:22:16.220 --> 02:22:18.500]   or for people that are in long-term relationships
[02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:21.200]   where they feel like something has shifted,
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:24.840]   and indeed, those shifts may reflect the output
[02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:27.120]   of different hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems.
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:28.960]   It almost certainly has to be the case, right?
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:29.860]   - Yeah.
[02:22:29.860 --> 02:22:33.580]   So just like women who spend a lot of time together,
[02:22:33.580 --> 02:22:35.040]   whether they're coworkers or whatever,
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:38.440]   a lot of times their menstrual cycles will align.
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:42.040]   There is a lot of pheromoneal and hormonal crosstalk,
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:44.800]   including prolactin between men and women.
[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:48.280]   So spending 100% of the time together,
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:51.080]   this is why people think it's so hard to work together
[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:51.960]   and live together.
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:54.240]   They're around each other 24/7.
[02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:55.600]   You don't have the reprieve
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:58.300]   where you let that dopamine settle down,
[02:22:58.300 --> 02:23:00.760]   and then you're excited when you see them again.
[02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:03.720]   A lot of guys know that if they've gone on a hunting trip
[02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:05.140]   or if they've gone on a trip for a long time,
[02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:07.860]   they come back and they see their partner,
[02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:10.120]   and it's like a new, not quite like a new relationship,
[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:11.960]   but almost like a new relationship,
[02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:13.660]   and they have that excitement again.
[02:23:13.660 --> 02:23:16.440]   And purposely building that into every relationship
[02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:18.180]   can help significantly,
[02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:21.760]   especially if you choose to have a child or get pregnant
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:23.080]   or be breastfeeding,
[02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:24.760]   because you just plan ahead
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:26.720]   for both of your prolactins to be high
[02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:28.840]   and both of your dopamines to be low
[02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:31.800]   and both of your testosterone to be low.
[02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:36.680]   So there's a lot of planning that you can do.
[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:41.680]   Essentially, every relationship goes through a crisis,
[02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:46.600]   and that crisis is personal between the two of you,
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:51.160]   and you can plan ahead and figure out a way,
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:52.660]   maybe it's not supplementation,
[02:23:52.660 --> 02:23:55.080]   maybe it's not even the amount of time
[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:56.880]   you spend away from each other,
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:24:00.400]   but plan ahead to have good times
[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:02.600]   if you know you're about to go into a crisis.
[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:03.440]   - Got it.
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:05.280]   And so it sounds like time apart and time together,
[02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:07.480]   which is actually built into a number of cultures
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:10.360]   where men and women will purposefully avoid each other
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:11.400]   for some period of time,
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:13.640]   avoid physical touch and maybe in proximity,
[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:14.660]   and then we'll reconvene,
[02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:16.360]   and yet those are very stable relationships
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:17.480]   over time often.
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:21.020]   Is the inverse also true?
[02:24:21.020 --> 02:24:21.860]   For instance, for people
[02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:24.160]   that are in long distance relationships,
[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:25.440]   where they're only seeing each other
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:27.640]   three or four days a week or two days a week,
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:32.080]   does this explain the fact that some of those relationships
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:33.640]   can go on for a very long period of time
[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:36.240]   without ever actually entering the,
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:38.040]   let's call it the hyperprolactin phase
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:40.960]   of actually moving in together and et cetera, et cetera?
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:42.120]   Like in other words,
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:46.000]   is that a way in which people are spiking
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.340]   and troughing dopamine that keeps them attached?
[02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:52.520]   This kind of elusive, this sort of, what is it called?
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:54.320]   I think it's called like a cat string.
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:56.580]   Like if you play with a cat and you move the string away,
[02:24:56.580 --> 02:24:57.420]   they'll keep reaching,
[02:24:57.420 --> 02:24:58.440]   but you throw the string on the ground,
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:24:59.880]   and they're like, they're totally uninterested in it.
[02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:01.240]   Is that what's going on?
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:02.960]   'Cause that's a dopaminergic phenomenon,
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.480]   the cat string example.
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:06.140]   We know this experimentally.
[02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:09.440]   - In those cases, the relationship hasn't really progressed,
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:13.440]   in many of those cases, past the dopamine spike,
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:15.840]   the fun initial stage, honeymoon stage,
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.080]   whatever you want to call it.
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:19.360]   So it's almost kind of like a roommate.
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:20.600]   If you're looking for a roommate,
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:23.360]   if it was for college or after college or whatever,
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:26.320]   you can fill out forms and look for common interests,
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:28.900]   but until you're actually together
[02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:31.320]   a significant proportion of the time,
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:32.160]   you're not really going to know
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:34.480]   if you're going to be compatible or not.
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:39.480]   - And is there evidence that the appearance of an infant
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:43.400]   changes, obviously there are going to be hormonal shifts.
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:47.460]   We know actually that for, in both women and in men,
[02:25:47.460 --> 02:25:49.360]   there's a prolactin increase
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:53.020]   when couples are expecting a child.
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:55.260]   This is the, it's almost like a brooding phenomenon.
[02:25:55.260 --> 02:25:58.400]   You see this in birds where it's actually called brooding
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:00.360]   and it's caused by prolactin increase,
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:03.180]   but it turns out this also occurs in humans.
[02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:05.020]   And some people would argue this causes
[02:26:05.020 --> 02:26:06.960]   the dad bod phenomenon because it actually,
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:08.720]   prolactin's involved in laying down a body fat,
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:10.460]   preparing for sleepless nights.
[02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:12.420]   And presumably that spike in prolactin
[02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:15.100]   is there also to suppress sexual activity
[02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:17.460]   because there are periods of time immediately
[02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:22.200]   near childbirth where sexual activity is not advantageous.
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:25.860]   - Yeah, you see a prolactin spike right after breastfeeding.
[02:26:25.860 --> 02:26:28.660]   So if you think about it, often when you have an infant,
[02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:33.120]   you'll breastfeed, put the infant to bed
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:35.040]   and then immediately go to bed with your partner,
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:36.780]   which is not particularly conducive.
[02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:40.000]   It's almost like trying to have intercourse back to back.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.320]   And it's very difficult.
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:43.240]   - Because of the, in the prolactin sense.
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:46.220]   - Yeah, low dopamine, high prolactin.
[02:26:46.220 --> 02:26:48.880]   Oxytocin is also increased significantly
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:51.380]   to help with milk let down as well.
[02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:54.380]   So yeah, as far as brooding,
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:58.740]   there's definitely a human equivalent of brooding.
[02:26:58.740 --> 02:27:03.280]   Some humans call it nesting instinct, which is both helpful,
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:07.440]   but it's not necessarily a bad change in relationship.
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:09.020]   It's just a change.
[02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:11.240]   And as long as you know that it's coming,
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:14.240]   you're gonna do better with it, just like any medication.
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:16.280]   If you are aware of the side effect
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:19.300]   and then it might happen, then when it happens,
[02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:24.300]   it's not only less severe, it also happens less often.
[02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:26.800]   - Very interesting. - You tell the patient.
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:28.320]   - Well, as a neuroscientist,
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:30.360]   I come from the framework that,
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:32.720]   of course hormones impact perception and behavior,
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:35.080]   but perception and behavior also impact hormones.
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:36.000]   I find this fascinating.
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.920]   I also really liked the example you gave
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:40.000]   of people taking time apart,
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:43.800]   but also these affiliative bonds that are non-romantic bonds
[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:47.740]   can serve as kind of a reservoir to replenish dopamine
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:51.560]   that is then released upon experience,
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:52.880]   going back to one's partner
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:54.840]   or some sort of regular feature of home.
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:57.260]   Very interesting.
[02:27:57.260 --> 02:27:59.020]   And of course this should exist on both sides.
[02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:02.560]   I'm guessing that from both the male side and female side,
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:05.240]   there's an interest in kind of separation and reunion
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:06.240]   as the theme.
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:09.000]   And I guess the frequency will vary for different couples
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.400]   in different situations.
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:12.320]   - Yeah, and I don't want to make it seem
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:13.600]   like prolactin is all bad.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:16.520]   So prolactin does help with the nesting instinct.
[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:19.120]   It helps with breastfeeding as well.
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:22.540]   A lot of women are diagnosed with luteal phase defects,
[02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:25.120]   which is basically the phase after ovulation,
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:26.960]   but before a period or giving birth.
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:29.840]   The pregnancy is kind of a prolonged luteal phase.
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:33.040]   And a lot of them will go on progesterone for this.
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:35.920]   Progesterone can also decrease prolactin.
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:38.040]   And prolactin is also helpful
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:40.320]   for the maturity of the lungs and infants.
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:43.360]   So it helps the sphingomyelin to lechithin ratio.
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:44.320]   So it can decrease,
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:46.700]   if your prolactin is too low through pregnancy,
[02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:49.360]   it spikes up very high during pregnancy,
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:51.400]   then it can lead to increased risk
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:54.120]   of respiratory distress of the newborn.
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:54.960]   - Really interesting.
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:56.680]   Yeah, so we certainly don't want to paint a picture
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:59.840]   where prolactin is the bad, bad hormone to avoid.
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:04.680]   It's without prolactin, none of us would be here, of course.
[02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:05.940]   It's so vital.
[02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:07.680]   I realized that earlier I raised the question
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:09.940]   about whether or not cold exposure
[02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:11.900]   could modify hormone output.
[02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:13.800]   In particular, whether or not ice baths
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:16.280]   or ice applied to specific tissues of the body,
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:19.520]   as people are doing one way or the other,
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:24.040]   can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels.
[02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:26.360]   In other words, does taking ice baths in cold showers
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:28.800]   increase testosterone and/or estrogen?
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:32.560]   - Yeah, so taking an ice bath or a cold shower
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:34.440]   or cold exposure in general,
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:36.800]   it's not going to correct a vitamin D deficiency
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:38.440]   or a metabolic syndrome.
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:40.760]   So there's a lot of things that it will not correct
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:44.720]   that are causes of hypogonadism or low testosterone,
[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:47.120]   but it will help acutely,
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:50.160]   specifically the application of cold
[02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:52.560]   to testes that are too warm.
[02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:55.040]   So if you have a varicocele
[02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:58.720]   or if you have a little bit of a primary hypogonadism,
[02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:02.780]   which is where testosterone is not released by the testes,
[02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:06.720]   but your LH and FSH signals are sufficiently high,
[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:11.080]   then you'll likely respond to cold exposure better.
[02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:12.380]   And there's actually undergarments
[02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:15.840]   that are designed specifically to help with fertility.
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:17.080]   And there's probably going to be more and more
[02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:18.120]   of that in the future.
[02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:20.280]   You just need to be careful not to get frostbite
[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:23.680]   because it's a particularly bad spot to get frostbite.
[02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:24.520]   - Noted.
[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:26.840]   Could you define varicocele?
[02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:28.320]   You mentioned it a few times.
[02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:30.440]   That's a varicose vein?
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:33.120]   - Yeah, so it's essentially a varicose vein.
[02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:36.920]   It brings warm blood and the venous flow
[02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:39.420]   or the flow back to the heart is not as good.
[02:30:39.420 --> 02:30:42.080]   Just like in the legs, it can happen in the scrotum.
[02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:44.360]   Usually about 20 to 25% of people
[02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:46.480]   have one grade of varicocele.
[02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:49.160]   There's grades one through four, one through five.
[02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:51.460]   And most people just have a very mild one,
[02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:53.000]   usually on the left side,
[02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.060]   because the blood has to go through further
[02:30:55.060 --> 02:30:56.680]   to get back to the heart.
[02:30:56.680 --> 02:31:00.120]   And it raises the temperature of the testes.
[02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:01.980]   Temperature is the enemy of testes.
[02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:04.640]   So they like to be five to 10 degrees cooler
[02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:06.000]   than the rest of the body.
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:09.180]   - So are saunas particularly bad for sperm production?
[02:31:09.180 --> 02:31:10.800]   - They can be, yeah.
[02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:11.820]   - When you say can be,
[02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:13.920]   how long could one safely be in the sauna?
[02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:16.100]   Would you want to go back and forth
[02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:18.620]   between the cold and sauna?
[02:31:18.620 --> 02:31:22.000]   Are there any data?
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.720]   - If someone is having infertility,
[02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:28.140]   then I tell them to avoid all saunas empirically.
[02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:32.040]   If someone has, if they're not infertile,
[02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:33.320]   but they have a low sperm count,
[02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:35.480]   I also tell them to avoid.
[02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:38.920]   However, it's mostly warmed water
[02:31:38.920 --> 02:31:42.100]   that can raise the temperature of the testes
[02:31:42.100 --> 02:31:43.600]   faster than the sauna.
[02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:45.000]   - So hot tubs and things of that sort.
[02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.040]   - Yeah, so hot tub and a jacuzzi,
[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:50.000]   those are enemies number one and number two of sperm.
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:54.220]   - What about ice baths and cold showers for women?
[02:31:54.220 --> 02:31:57.560]   Any evidence that it can shift hormone output in women?
[02:31:57.560 --> 02:31:58.720]   - Yeah, it can.
[02:31:58.720 --> 02:32:03.720]   It increases the activity of the beta adrenergic receptors,
[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:06.700]   even in the central nervous system
[02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:08.620]   and the astrocytes as well.
[02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:10.020]   So it can do a few things.
[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:15.020]   It can slightly decrease the drive for food,
[02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:17.420]   which astrocytes and beta adrenergic receptors
[02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:20.000]   have some medications that are weight loss medicines
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.540]   also do similar things.
[02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:26.900]   But it can be beneficial in women too.
[02:32:26.900 --> 02:32:28.360]   - But no evidence that it changes
[02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:30.980]   estrogen output in women, correct?
[02:32:30.980 --> 02:32:33.300]   - Not that I know of.
[02:32:33.300 --> 02:32:34.140]   - Me either.
[02:32:34.140 --> 02:32:38.960]   Peptides, lot of discussion these days about peptides.
[02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:41.020]   Peptides, of course, just being strings of amino acids,
[02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:42.940]   as you mentioned, very small ones,
[02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:45.060]   like two amino acids, like L-carnitine,
[02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:46.660]   all the way up to polypeptides,
[02:32:46.660 --> 02:32:49.720]   which just mean many, many, many amino acids.
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:52.800]   There are so many peptides that there's,
[02:32:52.800 --> 02:32:54.940]   we should probably just do an entire episode about peptides.
[02:32:54.940 --> 02:32:57.140]   But I think one of the reasons I'm hearing so much
[02:32:57.140 --> 02:32:58.480]   about peptides these days
[02:32:58.480 --> 02:33:00.860]   is that they are not called steroids.
[02:33:00.860 --> 02:33:03.480]   You know, the name steroids, I think,
[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:07.580]   has come to be associated with anabolic steroids
[02:33:07.580 --> 02:33:12.120]   in the context of acne, testosterone rage, et cetera.
[02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:16.420]   But of course, estrogen is a steroid hormone, right?
[02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:19.540]   There are other steroid hormones, as we both know.
[02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:23.440]   But peptides are gaining increasing popularity.
[02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:25.940]   I am willing to go on record saying that you can be sure
[02:33:25.940 --> 02:33:28.180]   that many of the incredible transformations
[02:33:28.180 --> 02:33:29.340]   that you see in Hollywood
[02:33:29.340 --> 02:33:32.380]   are the consequence of peptide use.
[02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:35.940]   And I put my name behind that
[02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:37.540]   because I'm well aware of people
[02:33:37.540 --> 02:33:40.660]   that use these to prepare for roles, but athletes use them.
[02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:42.460]   And then everyday people are using them too.
[02:33:42.460 --> 02:33:46.780]   For instance, sermorelin, tesemorelin, ipomorlin,
[02:33:46.780 --> 02:33:50.260]   to stimulate the release of growth hormone
[02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:52.260]   rather than taking growth hormone.
[02:33:52.260 --> 02:33:56.460]   PPC 157, which is essentially a synthetic gastric juice
[02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:58.840]   that normally repairs the gut.
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:01.100]   They're being used to treat injuries.
[02:34:01.100 --> 02:34:03.520]   And there are other ones as well.
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:05.300]   What can we say generally about peptides?
[02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:06.640]   Are they safe? Are they not safe?
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:08.020]   What about sourcing?
[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:09.220]   And are there any peptides
[02:34:09.220 --> 02:34:12.820]   that you think could be of particular use for people?
[02:34:12.820 --> 02:34:14.420]   And we should probably also touch on peptides
[02:34:14.420 --> 02:34:17.380]   that people shouldn't go anywhere near with a 10-foot pole.
[02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:18.420]   - Yeah, definitely.
[02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:20.560]   So peptides are very heterogeneous.
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:24.120]   There's very dangerous ones and very safe ones.
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:27.440]   My favorite peptide is the original peptide,
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:28.800]   which is insulin.
[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:31.360]   So insulin is a peptide.
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:34.960]   And less than a hundred years ago,
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:38.360]   there was a scientist studying insulin.
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:39.360]   And at some point,
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:43.280]   they saw that an animal had its diabetes cured
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:46.440]   by insulin injection.
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:47.680]   Less than a year later,
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:50.920]   they were injecting insulin into every type one diabetic
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:52.240]   because it was saving their lives.
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:54.640]   - And yet insulin can kill you
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:57.040]   if you take it at the incorrect dose.
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:59.400]   - Yeah, so just like insulin
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:01.200]   should be prescribed by a doctor,
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:04.160]   there is over-the-counter insulin rely on or NPH,
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:08.000]   but ideally your insulin is prescribed by your doctor
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:11.680]   for your diabetes as it's life-saving.
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:14.080]   Peptides should be prescribed by doctors as well.
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:16.580]   And there are several that are FDA approved.
[02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:19.220]   So you mentioned a lot of different ones.
[02:35:19.220 --> 02:35:21.300]   Let's start with tesamorylin.
[02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:24.300]   So tesamorylin was recently FDA approved
[02:35:24.300 --> 02:35:26.800]   for something called lipodystrophy.
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:31.160]   It happens where body fat is displaced into abnormal areas,
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:34.740]   often as part of AIDS or severe burns, things like that.
[02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:36.840]   And it helps redistribute this body fat
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:39.120]   and give people their quality of life back.
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:41.880]   Tesamorylin is a GHRH,
[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:44.600]   which I kind of loop into the category of GHRPs,
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:47.640]   so growth hormone releasing peptides.
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:49.660]   So it's only a couple amino acids different
[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:53.800]   from endogenously produced growth hormone releasing hormone.
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:57.460]   So growth hormone itself is also a peptide.
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:36:01.160]   It's a peptide hormone, not a steroid hormone.
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:05.620]   So you have different somatotrophs,
[02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:09.040]   which are very similar to growth hormone.
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:11.780]   Another fun fact is that HPL,
[02:36:11.780 --> 02:36:13.860]   which is human placental lactogen,
[02:36:13.860 --> 02:36:15.460]   we love acronyms, right?
[02:36:15.460 --> 02:36:18.560]   Human placental lactogen is nearly identical
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:19.640]   to growth hormone.
[02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:24.260]   The growth hormone in pregnancy is not what causes
[02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:26.600]   the sugar spike and gestational diabetes.
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:29.100]   It's the human placental lactogen.
[02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:31.220]   So if you look at twin pregnancies,
[02:36:31.220 --> 02:36:35.100]   if they have two placentas or more placental tissue
[02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:37.520]   making more human placental lactogen,
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:42.320]   the risk of gestational diabetes is exponentially higher.
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:46.920]   So this HPL is only a couple molecules different
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:48.520]   from growth hormone.
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:52.680]   It is interesting that these different GHRHs and GHRPs
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:55.360]   actually have pretty different mechanisms of action.
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:58.420]   Grelin is also a hormone that's released
[02:36:58.420 --> 02:36:59.780]   when you're hungry.
[02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:01.400]   This is probably one of the reasons
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:04.360]   why you have more growth hormone release overnight.
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:05.560]   And there's a lot of peptides
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:07.620]   that are very similar to ghrelin.
[02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:11.480]   So these peptides are not bio-identical peptides,
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:14.480]   but they just have a couple different amino acids changed.
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:16.880]   So they're almost identical.
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:19.220]   And they're probably going to be used in the future
[02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:21.000]   for growth hormone deficiencies,
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.020]   including in kids they've been studied.
[02:37:23.020 --> 02:37:24.400]   - So if somebody wants to increase
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:25.600]   their growth hormone output,
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:29.600]   in addition to not eating within two hours of sleep,
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:31.080]   getting good, deep sleep,
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:34.480]   doing all the other things in the six pillars
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:35.400]   that you mentioned earlier,
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:39.120]   especially resistance exercise at some point
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:40.180]   earlier in the day,
[02:37:41.340 --> 02:37:43.280]   what are the risks and benefits
[02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:46.400]   of taking a growth hormone releasing hormone peptide
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:50.100]   like sirloin, prescribed by a doctor, of course?
[02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:53.420]   What should one be concerned about?
[02:37:53.420 --> 02:37:54.780]   How long could one take these?
[02:37:54.780 --> 02:37:57.280]   I've even heard that they can modify gene expression
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:38:00.380]   so that they really are changing your hypothalamus
[02:38:00.380 --> 02:38:02.800]   in very long lasting ways.
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:05.340]   - Yeah, there's definitely a lot of risk,
[02:38:05.340 --> 02:38:07.600]   tumor growth and cancer.
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:10.360]   So you look at a type one diabetic,
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:14.540]   they have very high incidences of various types of cancer.
[02:38:14.540 --> 02:38:16.060]   They have very high growth hormone,
[02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:18.960]   but low IGF-1 paradoxically.
[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:21.760]   So they would likely give you a similar cancer risk
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:26.620]   to a type one diabetic that has very high growth hormone.
[02:38:26.620 --> 02:38:29.480]   However, there are the benefits of it.
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:33.260]   You think of lipolysis, decreased body fat,
[02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:34.940]   increased lean body mass.
[02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:38.460]   A lot of those you can use other things
[02:38:38.460 --> 02:38:40.300]   to get those benefits.
[02:38:40.300 --> 02:38:45.300]   So then you don't need growth hormone for those benefits.
[02:38:45.300 --> 02:38:48.260]   It just leaves cosmetic benefit
[02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:49.900]   to which you can usually use topicals
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:52.820]   to get your hair and your skin and your nails.
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:55.180]   There's a lot of other things that you can do
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:57.020]   other than growth hormone.
[02:38:57.020 --> 02:39:00.860]   So a lot of people just don't need these GHRPs
[02:39:00.860 --> 02:39:02.860]   if they don't have lipodystrophy
[02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:05.080]   or if they don't have growth hormone deficiency.
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:09.040]   There is other uses of them specifically in injuries.
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:11.280]   So I know that they've been studied.
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:12.620]   I'm not sure if it's in the military.
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:16.060]   We mentioned the woodpecker or the coup contrecoup injury.
[02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:17.020]   So that can obviously-
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:17.860]   - Head resulting back and forth.
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:19.120]   Then the brain basically slamming up
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:20.340]   against the front of the skull.
[02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:24.020]   Yeah, football, heading the ball in soccer.
[02:39:24.020 --> 02:39:26.980]   Definitely people who use the 50 caliber in military,
[02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:29.800]   although that's a fairly small population.
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:33.340]   And I think anyone that's hit their head hard
[02:39:33.340 --> 02:39:34.240]   more than once.
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:35.080]   - Yeah.
[02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:38.340]   We can talk about BPC-157 for a bit.
[02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:40.260]   GHK copper peptide for a bit.
[02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:44.520]   TB-500 or a thymosin beta-4 analog.
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:48.060]   And then we can also talk about bromelanotide,
[02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:49.760]   which is melanotan-3.
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:51.960]   They have melanotan-1 and 2.
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:54.040]   And then they also have melanotan-3 and 4.
[02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:56.980]   - Yeah, let's talk about BPC-157 and melanotan.
[02:39:56.980 --> 02:39:57.940]   'Cause I think those are the ones
[02:39:57.940 --> 02:40:01.860]   that most people are eyeing, so to speak.
[02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:06.300]   - So BPC-157 is body protective compound, 157.
[02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:09.860]   It's identical or bio-identical
[02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:13.080]   to gastric protective compound, 157,
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:14.860]   that's produced in the stomach.
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:19.860]   So as you age, you get atrophic gastritis very often.
[02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:22.620]   That's why you have less intrinsic factor,
[02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:25.740]   which is kind of another peptide that binds to vitamin B12.
[02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:28.980]   That's why you can get age-related B12 deficiencies.
[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:32.420]   So that's one reason why you have more colitis,
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:34.040]   more diverticulitis as you age.
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:36.640]   You don't have that gastric protective compound.
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:41.600]   It increases VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor,
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:45.360]   which basically makes your blood vessels grow more.
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:49.520]   So that's what causes your body to form a blood vessel.
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:53.020]   So another medication known as Avastin,
[02:40:53.020 --> 02:40:57.660]   it's on the WHO's list of essential medications for cancer.
[02:40:57.660 --> 02:41:00.980]   So many different types of cancer, including colon cancer,
[02:41:00.980 --> 02:41:04.240]   you treat it with Avastin, which is a VEGF inhibitor.
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:06.380]   So if you have cancer or a high cancer risk,
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:08.680]   you probably don't want to be taking a medication
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:11.300]   that's the exact opposite mechanism of action
[02:41:11.300 --> 02:41:14.200]   as your essential anti-cancer med.
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:15.940]   - In other words, if you have cancer,
[02:41:15.940 --> 02:41:18.440]   you're at risk of cancer, avoid BPC-157.
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:19.380]   - Correct.
[02:41:19.380 --> 02:41:21.900]   A lot of people prescribe it for six weeks.
[02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:25.980]   And BPC-157, so bremelanotide, that is FDA approved
[02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:29.380]   for a hypoactive sexual disorder.
[02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:32.440]   Tessamoralin, that's also approved for lipodystrophy.
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:35.600]   Interestingly, another one of the melanotans
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:38.160]   is also approved for lipodystrophy
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:41.840]   and also deficiency in the melanocorticoid receptor.
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:43.760]   So the receptor that receives
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:47.280]   the alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone,
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:48.700]   it's a very rare condition.
[02:41:48.700 --> 02:41:52.560]   It's also approved for that because if you don't take it,
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:54.480]   then you get obesity.
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:58.080]   But BPC-157 is not FDA approved,
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:01.080]   but it is essentially standard of care at this point.
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:04.860]   I would say if you're not counting insulin
[02:42:04.860 --> 02:42:06.880]   or growth hormone as peptides,
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:09.440]   it's one of the most commonly used peptides.
[02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:12.360]   And anecdotally and in some clinical literature,
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:15.680]   it's fairly well tolerated for short periods of time.
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:17.720]   I'm not in the camp that everybody needs to do it
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:20.360]   two to three times a week or even daily
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:22.760]   for six weeks no matter what.
[02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:26.900]   The major benefit is when you're gonna take it early on
[02:42:26.900 --> 02:42:31.000]   because it's gonna allow your body to increase blood flow
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:34.080]   to the injured area and the less blood flow it has,
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:36.800]   for example, cartilage ligaments have horrible blood flow,
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:38.460]   especially as people age.
[02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:40.040]   It's gonna make a significant difference.
[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:42.120]   So I would wager that that Russian gymnast
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:44.020]   that Achilles healed in one month
[02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:46.120]   and completely from a full rupture
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:49.280]   was likely taking BPC-157 or something very similar.
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:51.240]   - Yeah, I'm willing to wager on that as well.
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:52.760]   A remarkable recovery.
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:55.760]   And so because it is prescription,
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:57.180]   there are non-prescription forms.
[02:42:57.180 --> 02:42:59.120]   My understanding of the non-prescription forms
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:02.180]   and the danger of going after non-prescription forms
[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:04.780]   is that oftentimes they will contain
[02:43:04.780 --> 02:43:08.000]   what they claim they contain, BPC-157 in this case,
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:11.280]   but they are not adequately cleaning out the LPS,
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:14.040]   the lipopolysaccharide, which can cause inflammation.
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:14.960]   In fact, in the laboratory,
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:18.480]   we use LPS to deliberately induce fever and inflammation
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:20.680]   to study systemic inflammation.
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:22.280]   So this is a warning to people
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:23.380]   if you're interested in peptides,
[02:43:23.380 --> 02:43:26.340]   you absolutely need to work with a physician, in my opinion.
[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:28.340]   Get it from a really good compounding pharmacy
[02:43:28.340 --> 02:43:31.660]   who will clean out, that cleans out the LPS.
[02:43:31.660 --> 02:43:34.340]   Because if you're buying it through a source that,
[02:43:34.340 --> 02:43:36.080]   you know, a lot of people, I don't want to name sources,
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:37.700]   but there are these common sources on the internet
[02:43:37.700 --> 02:43:38.540]   that everyone knows about.
[02:43:38.540 --> 02:43:39.540]   They're buying these sources.
[02:43:39.540 --> 02:43:41.340]   They'll ship it to anyone essentially.
[02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:45.680]   But then the LPS is really causing inflammation.
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:48.140]   And many people experience a kind of mild fever
[02:43:48.140 --> 02:43:50.260]   or tingling from that when they inject it.
[02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:51.540]   And they're like, "Oh, I can feel it working."
[02:43:51.540 --> 02:43:55.940]   That's probably LPS action, which is not good for the brain.
[02:43:55.940 --> 02:43:58.940]   I don't know about the, on other peripheral tissues.
[02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:01.020]   I haven't heard of people dropping dead from this stuff yet,
[02:44:01.020 --> 02:44:03.020]   but I certainly wouldn't want to be ingesting
[02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:04.620]   any LPS unnecessarily.
[02:44:04.620 --> 02:44:07.340]   So would you agree that you should work with a doctor?
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:08.180]   After all, you are a doctor.
[02:44:08.180 --> 02:44:10.800]   - Yeah, definitely talk to your doctor about this
[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:12.940]   and talk to them about the dosing regimen as well.
[02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:15.100]   So if they have you doing it for six weeks,
[02:44:15.100 --> 02:44:17.260]   ask them, "Why am I doing it for six weeks?
[02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:19.940]   Why not two weeks or why not as soon as I feel better,
[02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:21.360]   can I just stop it?"
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:22.960]   - Yeah, there's a lot of good questions like that
[02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:24.300]   that you should ask your doctor.
[02:44:24.300 --> 02:44:25.760]   And if somebody is trying to prescribe you
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:28.940]   a bunch of different things, then see,
[02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:30.580]   is this what they prescribe everybody
[02:44:30.580 --> 02:44:32.620]   or is this individualized for me?
[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:35.020]   There are peptides like GHK copper peptide,
[02:44:35.020 --> 02:44:37.060]   which is produced endogenously in the liver
[02:44:37.060 --> 02:44:38.700]   more at younger ages.
[02:44:38.700 --> 02:44:40.440]   That's why the liver can regenerate fully
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:43.180]   is this a GHK copper peptide helps.
[02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:44.460]   And if you're copper deficient,
[02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:45.720]   which not a whole lot of people are,
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:47.600]   but a lot of people that have had bariatric surgery
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:49.260]   are copper deficient.
[02:44:49.260 --> 02:44:51.740]   GHK copper peptide can help significantly
[02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:53.280]   with your nervous system.
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:54.580]   And it's also synergistic.
[02:44:54.580 --> 02:44:57.400]   So any growth agonists like thymus and beta-4
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:00.120]   made in kids in the thymus, which shrinks,
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:03.080]   that's another reason why kids heal really well.
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:06.580]   That and GHK is somewhat synergistic with BPC,
[02:45:06.580 --> 02:45:08.840]   but if you don't need all three, you don't want them.
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:10.420]   And if you don't need it for more than a week,
[02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:13.000]   you don't want it for more than a week.
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:14.440]   - I really appreciate you saying that.
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:16.580]   I often say that sometimes the best dose
[02:45:16.580 --> 02:45:18.580]   of something to take is zero.
[02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:21.580]   That's often the case that the best dosage is zero.
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:22.640]   You mentioned melanotan.
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:24.700]   There are several kinds of melanotan.
[02:45:24.700 --> 02:45:26.760]   I find it a little bit of a funny conversation
[02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:29.120]   because I first learned about melanotan
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:31.780]   from reading about peptides and discovering
[02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:35.320]   that people were taking, injecting melanotan to get tan
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:38.580]   because it's in the melanin synthesis pathway.
[02:45:38.580 --> 02:45:41.380]   They also discovered, this isn't an individual,
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:44.120]   this is reading about this in various manuscripts
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:47.100]   and peer-reviewed papers that it could cause things
[02:45:47.100 --> 02:45:49.620]   like pre-opism, like sustained erection
[02:45:49.620 --> 02:45:52.340]   that might be the last one that anyone would ever have
[02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:55.060]   because of damage to the vasculature.
[02:45:55.060 --> 02:45:59.260]   Also women taking melanotan as a way to get tan
[02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:00.820]   and lose body fat.
[02:46:00.820 --> 02:46:02.540]   So this sounds all very recreational.
[02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:07.020]   Are there any clinical usage of melanotan?
[02:46:07.020 --> 02:46:09.520]   So separate from the kind of extreme biohacking
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:12.140]   cosmetic world, which is really not the main focus
[02:46:12.140 --> 02:46:15.620]   of this podcast ever, but more in terms of, you know,
[02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:18.060]   pursuing health optimization.
[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:21.480]   - Yeah, there's actually three FDA approved indications,
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:22.320]   believe it or not.
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:23.320]   Not many people know about this,
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:26.820]   but there's three well-accepted indications.
[02:46:26.820 --> 02:46:29.500]   One of them is the hypoactive sexual disorder
[02:46:29.500 --> 02:46:30.400]   and more in women.
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:31.960]   That's for brimelanotide.
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:33.900]   - So those are women that have essentially
[02:46:33.900 --> 02:46:38.380]   no libido whatsoever, but other hormones are in check.
[02:46:38.380 --> 02:46:42.360]   - Classically, it's before menopause.
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:45.700]   So those hormonal issues are not contributing.
[02:46:45.700 --> 02:46:48.420]   And when you give them this peptide,
[02:46:48.420 --> 02:46:51.860]   it's also known as PT-141, it helps significantly.
[02:46:51.860 --> 02:46:53.940]   A lot of times you use it in a nasal spray.
[02:46:53.940 --> 02:46:55.520]   It goes straight into the central nervous system
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:46:56.360]   and acts centrally.
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:46:59.320]   You can also inject it and you can also take it via trochee.
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:00.600]   - Men and women take it?
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:01.460]   - Correct.
[02:47:01.460 --> 02:47:05.340]   It's approved for women, but it can also help men.
[02:47:05.340 --> 02:47:07.380]   And it's relatively safe.
[02:47:07.380 --> 02:47:10.020]   The only relative contraindication that I tell people,
[02:47:10.020 --> 02:47:11.640]   and a lot of people say, oh, there's no side effects
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:15.560]   that I know of, but if you have a family history of melanoma
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:18.380]   or potentially have a melanoma and don't know about it,
[02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:20.700]   that's why I'm a big advocate of germoscopy as well
[02:47:20.700 --> 02:47:23.120]   and regular skin checks, then theoretically,
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:27.120]   it's gonna increase that alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:28.420]   and it can grow that.
[02:47:28.420 --> 02:47:31.340]   So that's definitely not a good thing.
[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:33.680]   So be very careful about long-term administration of it.
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:35.880]   It's also approved for lipodystrophy,
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:39.300]   which is the same exact thing as tesamoralin,
[02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:44.300]   which I believe is also known as Evista or Agrifta.
[02:47:44.300 --> 02:47:47.740]   And then it's also approved for the rare genetic condition
[02:47:47.740 --> 02:47:50.980]   where your receptors or your melanocytes
[02:47:50.980 --> 02:47:52.200]   don't proliferate as well.
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:53.900]   So you usually have hypopigmentation.
[02:47:53.900 --> 02:47:55.540]   It's not true albinism,
[02:47:55.540 --> 02:47:59.740]   but it's associated with morbid morbid obesity
[02:47:59.740 --> 02:48:02.420]   and very poor outcomes from that in childhood.
[02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:04.180]   So it's used in kids actually.
[02:48:04.180 --> 02:48:05.620]   - Interesting.
[02:48:05.620 --> 02:48:08.140]   - Well, peptides are a fascinating landscape,
[02:48:08.140 --> 02:48:12.700]   but thank you for that deep dive into several of them.
[02:48:12.700 --> 02:48:15.200]   We will probably return to you
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:17.540]   to talk about peptides again in the near future,
[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:19.040]   because I know there's a lot more there
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:20.140]   and a lot of interest.
[02:48:20.140 --> 02:48:23.460]   I want to talk about the sixth pillar, all right?
[02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:27.820]   So just to remind people, you said diet, exercise,
[02:48:27.820 --> 02:48:31.500]   where appropriate caloric restriction, managing stress,
[02:48:31.500 --> 02:48:35.580]   sleep and sunlight are critical for everyone at all ages
[02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:38.160]   to manage and optimize hormone health.
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:39.360]   Then you have the sixth category,
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:42.600]   which is a really intriguing one, which is spirit,
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:44.900]   which is a kind of unusual thing to hear coming
[02:48:44.900 --> 02:48:48.260]   from a medical doctor, except that I have many colleagues
[02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:51.740]   and indeed our former director
[02:48:51.740 --> 02:48:53.840]   of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins,
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:55.780]   has talked about this notion of spirit.
[02:48:55.780 --> 02:48:58.040]   We've talked about belief effects on this podcast
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:59.540]   before with Ali Krum.
[02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:02.600]   How one's understanding of the things that they do
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:06.840]   and their world in general really creates an important effect
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:09.720]   on everything at the level of physiology,
[02:49:09.720 --> 02:49:11.000]   not just psychology.
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:14.360]   So as a physician, how do you conceptualize
[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:16.780]   the spiritual aspect and how do you talk to patients
[02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:19.360]   about this given that people walking into your clinic
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:21.360]   presumably have a bunch of different religious
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:22.720]   and not a religious backgrounds?
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:23.840]   I'm sure some are atheists,
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:25.960]   some are probably strong believers.
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:28.080]   How do you deal with that
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:30.520]   and how should people think about this?
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:34.820]   - Yeah, I believe it is surprisingly well-received.
[02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:36.820]   You wouldn't think at first glance
[02:49:36.820 --> 02:49:38.200]   that a patient really wants to talk
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:41.040]   about their spiritual health with their doctor.
[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:43.260]   But the way I think about it and the way that it really is,
[02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:44.680]   is it's like a Venn diagram
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:47.040]   and you have a body and a mind and a soul
[02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:49.440]   and you can't have one healthy without the other healthy.
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:52.480]   Even if your mental health is phenomenal
[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:54.740]   and even if your physical health is phenomenal,
[02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:57.240]   the mental aspect of spirituality,
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:49:59.420]   if that piece is not there,
[02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:03.920]   then that's gonna affect your body physiologically as well.
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:06.400]   And Ali Crum's done some excellent work.
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:09.680]   There's also been a lot of other studies regarding prayer.
[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:11.540]   And I'm a Christian, I believe in God,
[02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:15.300]   and that gives me a lot of that resilience and motivation.
[02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:18.140]   It gives me the cornerstone or the groundwork,
[02:50:18.140 --> 02:50:20.560]   how I can interact with life.
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:22.420]   And regardless if someone's an atheist
[02:50:22.420 --> 02:50:25.440]   or regardless of what someone believes
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:29.560]   as far as religion or the origin of the species,
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:32.620]   they can know that their spirituality
[02:50:32.620 --> 02:50:34.340]   is going to have a profound effect
[02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:37.600]   on their mental and physical health as well.
[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:39.280]   People like to compartmentalize it.
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:41.640]   So they like to talk to their doctor
[02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:42.960]   only about the physical health
[02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:44.280]   'cause it's comfortable to do that.
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:46.760]   They only talk to their pastor or a mom
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:50.160]   or a reiki healer for their spiritual health.
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:52.860]   And they just talk to their therapist or psychiatrist
[02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:55.080]   about their mental health.
[02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:58.280]   But you need to bring all three of those things together.
[02:50:58.280 --> 02:51:00.560]   It's well known that interdisciplinary clinics
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:02.860]   lead to improved patient outcomes,
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:04.700]   and that's just disciplines within medicine.
[02:51:04.700 --> 02:51:08.900]   So that's just doctors that are specializing in this or this.
[02:51:08.900 --> 02:51:13.320]   So this takes a step back in the upper part of that tree
[02:51:13.320 --> 02:51:16.160]   before you've reached those dichotomies or the split offs.
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:18.840]   You have your body and your mind and your soul,
[02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:20.680]   so your spiritual health and your mental health
[02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:21.880]   and your physical health.
[02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:26.840]   So if you're in line in all three of those things,
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:29.160]   that builds the cornerstone for the rest of your health
[02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:30.620]   and the rest of your life.
[02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:33.200]   - So if someone comes into your clinic and they say,
[02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:35.160]   they're feeling one way in their body,
[02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:37.300]   they're feeling one way in their emotional life,
[02:51:37.300 --> 02:51:39.600]   you run their charts, you get their blood work,
[02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:44.520]   and they're an atheist or they're agnostic,
[02:51:44.520 --> 02:51:48.780]   what are some of the six pillar practices
[02:51:48.780 --> 02:51:51.520]   that they can consider that are in keeping
[02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:54.800]   with their atheism or agnosticism?
[02:51:54.800 --> 02:51:58.680]   Because I have to assume that people who participate
[02:51:58.680 --> 02:52:02.000]   or feel that they belong to a particular religious sect
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:03.960]   will have particular prescriptives
[02:52:03.960 --> 02:52:07.500]   from those religious sects that will direct them
[02:52:07.500 --> 02:52:08.880]   towards particular types of prayer.
[02:52:08.880 --> 02:52:13.160]   But how would somebody who doesn't have a prescriptive
[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:15.000]   coming to them from some other source,
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.680]   what could they do or would they do?
[02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:19.900]   - Yeah, so I certainly don't force prayer on anybody
[02:52:19.900 --> 02:52:21.300]   or anything like that.
[02:52:21.300 --> 02:52:25.780]   But it's my belief that especially being an agnostic,
[02:52:25.780 --> 02:52:29.540]   it's almost the hardest thing because if you're an atheist,
[02:52:29.540 --> 02:52:32.460]   then you have some groundwork and you have some spirituality
[02:52:32.460 --> 02:52:36.780]   even if it has to do with the human spirit's interaction
[02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:38.000]   with the environment,
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.220]   things that can't be physically explained well,
[02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:42.640]   phenomenon like the work that Ali Krum does.
[02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:45.760]   But if you're agnostic, you're still trying to find that.
[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:50.080]   So I hope that everybody does find what they truly believe in
[02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:52.760]   as far as their own spirituality.
[02:52:52.760 --> 02:52:55.880]   But yeah, that's a personal journey
[02:52:55.880 --> 02:52:58.440]   from a physician standpoint.
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:52:59.900]   And even if I'm friends with him as well
[02:52:59.900 --> 02:53:01.020]   from a friend standpoint,
[02:53:01.020 --> 02:53:04.720]   I don't like to push anybody in any specific direction.
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:07.160]   So I don't think that everybody should believe
[02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:08.380]   what I believe.
[02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:11.640]   And I don't feel like there should be any pressure
[02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:14.380]   for them to believe something different.
[02:53:14.380 --> 02:53:17.160]   So I think that there can be excellent physician,
[02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:20.600]   patient rapport, regardless of what we believe
[02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:22.280]   and what our backgrounds are.
[02:53:22.280 --> 02:53:23.120]   - Yeah.
[02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:24.960]   That's wonderful to hear.
[02:53:24.960 --> 02:53:27.300]   I can say without revealing any names
[02:53:27.300 --> 02:53:30.760]   that I have close colleagues that in every bin
[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:34.000]   of this spectrum, like hardcore atheists,
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:38.280]   hardcore religious in different domains, different religions.
[02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:40.840]   I don't know if I know many,
[02:53:40.840 --> 02:53:43.080]   I'm agnostic as to whether or not I know any agnostics,
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:44.360]   I should say.
[02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:46.300]   It's not something that people commonly discuss,
[02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:48.620]   but in the context of science and medicine,
[02:53:48.620 --> 02:53:50.780]   but it's starting to happen more and more.
[02:53:50.780 --> 02:53:52.740]   And certainly this issue of spirituality
[02:53:52.740 --> 02:53:54.680]   is one of the areas in which neuroscience
[02:53:54.680 --> 02:53:55.840]   is asking a lot of questions,
[02:53:55.840 --> 02:53:59.080]   like what spiritual experiences really are
[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:00.760]   in terms of how they're grounded in the brain
[02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:02.040]   or not grounded in the brain.
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:04.520]   I think it's a really interesting area for discovery.
[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:06.940]   And I appreciate that you bring it up
[02:54:06.940 --> 02:54:09.680]   and you bring it up in the non-pressured way that you do.
[02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:11.840]   I think that it will stimulate a lot of thinking,
[02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:14.960]   which is ultimately the goal of this podcast.
[02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:19.360]   - Well, I have one final question
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:23.000]   that a listener insisted I ask,
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.880]   and it's a very straightforward one.
[02:54:25.880 --> 02:54:28.720]   It's not at all a curve ball and not at all related
[02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:30.340]   to what we were just talking about,
[02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:32.000]   but it was the most common question
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.340]   when I told people that I was going to be talking to you,
[02:54:34.340 --> 02:54:38.880]   which is, is caffeine problematic for hormones?
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:39.720]   It's amazing.
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:43.360]   I received hundreds of the same question about caffeine.
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:45.860]   And since it's probably the most commonly used drug
[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:48.900]   on the planet, I know it's taking us back
[02:54:48.900 --> 02:54:52.920]   into the very practical, but in closing,
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:53.760]   we're not quite there yet,
[02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:57.620]   but in closing, is caffeine having an effect one way
[02:54:57.620 --> 02:54:59.800]   or the other on testosterone, estrogen,
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:04.520]   or other hormones that is positive, negative, or neutral?
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:05.800]   - Only if it affects your sleep.
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:07.080]   So it works on adenosine,
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:10.200]   and it can actually slightly improve allergies as well,
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:13.060]   but negligible effect otherwise.
[02:55:13.060 --> 02:55:13.900]   - Great.
[02:55:13.900 --> 02:55:16.280]   Well, sorry to end on such a practical brass tacks
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:19.640]   type of question, but I did promise to the listeners
[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:21.560]   that I would ask that question.
[02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:24.080]   Listen, I want to sincerely thank you.
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:27.140]   We covered basically an endocrinology textbook,
[02:55:27.140 --> 02:55:29.680]   a neuroendocrinology textbook's worth of information,
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:32.160]   a ton of practical tips in there.
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:33.600]   Where can people find out more about you?
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:35.440]   We will certainly provide links.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:38.520]   And I guess the other question is, are you taking patients?
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:40.560]   I'm sure you'll hear that in the various venues
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:41.600]   where people can contact you,
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:45.240]   but where are you active in terms of public facing work?
[02:55:45.240 --> 02:55:48.120]   - I'm active on Instagram, KyleJilletteMD.
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:52.020]   I'm also active on the social medias of my brand new clinic,
[02:55:52.020 --> 02:55:53.580]   which is Gillette Health.
[02:55:53.580 --> 02:55:57.040]   That's @JilletteHealth on Instagram or jillettehealth.com.
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:58.540]   - Great. We'll provide links to those.
[02:55:58.540 --> 02:56:01.380]   And I should say that the content you've been putting out
[02:56:01.380 --> 02:56:02.480]   on Instagram is terrific
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:04.680]   because you actually point to specific studies
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:06.820]   and you put things into actionable context,
[02:56:06.820 --> 02:56:09.720]   which is very meaningful for me.
[02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:13.120]   Kyle, Dr. Gillette, I should say,
[02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:14.420]   thanks so much for your time.
[02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:15.260]   I really appreciate it.
[02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:16.680]   I know the listeners will too.
[02:56:16.680 --> 02:56:18.440]   - Thank you. My pleasure.
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:20.120]   - Thank you for joining me for my discussion
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:24.080]   about hormone health and optimization with Dr. Kyle Gillette.
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:25.240]   As you just heard,
[02:56:25.240 --> 02:56:29.920]   he is a treasure trove of actionable, clear information.
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:32.680]   And again, you can find him teaching more about hormones
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:35.960]   and other aspects of health on Instagram @KyleJillette.
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:39.520]   That's Gillette with two T's and two L's, but no E.
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:42.080]   Kyle Gillette MD on Instagram
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:44.900]   and Gillette Health on all other platforms.
[02:56:44.900 --> 02:56:47.480]   And if you would like more information about his practice,
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:50.240]   you can find that at jillettehealth.com.

[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:25.760]   We also have a Patreon.
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:28.760]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:30.400]   And there you can support the podcast
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:31.760]   at any level that you like.
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:34.040]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:36.860]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:39.440]   While supplements certainly aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:41.760]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:44.240]   for things like optimizing sleep and focus
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:45.840]   and indeed hormone health.
[02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:47.920]   Anytime you're considering taking a supplement,
[02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:49.680]   you want to make sure that the supplements
[02:57:49.680 --> 02:57:51.420]   are of the very highest quality.
[02:57:51.420 --> 02:57:55.380]   For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:57:55.380 --> 02:57:56.800]   because Thorne supplements are known
[02:57:56.800 --> 02:57:58.480]   to have the highest levels of stringency
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:00.480]   in terms of the quality of their ingredients
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:02.920]   and precision about the amounts of the ingredients
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:03.920]   that they put in each bottle.
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:05.900]   Meaning what is listed on the packaging
[02:58:05.900 --> 02:58:07.800]   is actually what's contained in those supplements,
[02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:11.220]   which is not true for many supplement companies out there.
[02:58:11.220 --> 02:58:13.160]   If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,
[02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:16.160]   you can go to Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E dot com
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:18.800]   slash the letter U slash Huberman,
[02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:21.600]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:24.240]   Also, if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site,
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:27.000]   so go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.200]   but then pass into thorne.com.
[02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:31.820]   You can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[02:58:31.820 --> 02:58:33.160]   in the Thorne catalog.
[02:58:33.160 --> 02:58:36.260]   If you're not already following us on Instagram and Twitter,
[02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:37.100]   please do so.
[02:58:37.100 --> 02:58:39.340]   It's Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter.
[02:58:39.340 --> 02:58:41.800]   And there I cover science and science-based tools,
[02:58:41.800 --> 02:58:43.420]   some of which overlap with the contents
[02:58:43.420 --> 02:58:44.600]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:58:44.600 --> 02:58:46.380]   but much of which is distinct
[02:58:46.380 --> 02:58:48.740]   from the contents of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:58:48.740 --> 02:58:50.520]   And again, we are hosting two live events,
[02:58:50.520 --> 02:58:53.080]   one in Seattle on May 17th,
[02:58:53.080 --> 02:58:55.640]   another in Portland on May 18th.
[02:58:55.640 --> 02:58:57.860]   That series is called the Brain Body Contract,
[02:58:57.860 --> 02:59:00.240]   where I'll talk about science and science-based tools,
[02:59:00.240 --> 02:59:01.920]   some of which I have never talked about
[02:59:01.920 --> 02:59:03.280]   in a public forum before.
[02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:05.880]   And there'll be an open question and answer format
[02:59:05.880 --> 02:59:07.640]   for you to ask me your questions,
[02:59:07.640 --> 02:59:10.340]   and I will do my best to answer them in real time.
[02:59:10.340 --> 02:59:11.800]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:59:11.800 --> 02:59:14.240]   for today's discussion with Dr. Kyle Gillette.
[02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:17.380]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[02:59:17.380 --> 02:59:19.960]   [upbeat music]
[02:59:19.960 --> 02:59:22.540]   (upbeat music)
