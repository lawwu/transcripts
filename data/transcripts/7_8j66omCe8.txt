[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Now, before you launched FTX, you gave detailed instructions to the existing
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.860]   exchanges about how to improve their system, how to remove clawbacks, and so
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.560]   on. Looking back, they left billions of dollars of value on the table.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.880]   Why do you think that was? Why didn't they just fix what you told them to fix?
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.560]   One piece of this is just like they didn't have a lot of market structure
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.760]   experts. They just did not have the talent in-house to be able to think
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.600]   really well and deeply about risk engines.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.480]   And also there are cultural barriers between myself and some of them, which I
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.960]   think probably meant that they were less inclined than they otherwise would
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.200]   have been to sort of take it very seriously.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.240]   But ignoring those factors, I think there's something much bigger at play
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.560]   there, where many of these exchanges had hired a lot of people.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.720]   They'd gotten very large.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.120]   And you might think that that meant that they got more able to do things because
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.240]   they had more sort of like horsepower.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.320]   But in practice, most of the times that we see a company grow really fast, really
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.080]   quickly, and get really big in terms of number of people, it becomes an absolute
