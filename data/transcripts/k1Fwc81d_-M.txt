[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   - We are in the middle of the holiday season
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.240]   between Thanksgiving and Christmas,
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.020]   so it is probably unfair to ask this question now,
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.280]   but a podcast listener named Jan writes in to ask it,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.080]   and so I will pass it on to you, Pastor John.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.720]   I was wondering, how would you define the sin of gluttony?
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.200]   - I think it's helpful in talking about gluttony
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200]   to compare it to other sins and why it is
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.360]   that something good, like food and the enjoyment of it,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.360]   becomes sinful.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.780]   For example, the existence of sexual desires
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.060]   and the experience of them per se is not evil,
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.220]   but there is such a thing as the sin of lust.
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.340]   The enjoyment of someone's praising you
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.960]   is not necessarily evil,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.460]   but it can become the sin of vainglory.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.420]   The enjoyment of God-given rest is not evil,
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.020]   but it can become the sin of sloth or laziness.
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.640]   The enjoyment of proper self-respect
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.380]   can become the sin of pride,
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.640]   and the desire to have something innocent,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.960]   home, car, computer, can become the sin of covetousness,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.360]   or even worse, the sin of envy,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.320]   if you're resentful that somebody else has it
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.320]   and you don't, and the legitimate desire
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.880]   and enjoyment of food can become gluttony.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.880]   I think it's helpful to see what's really going on
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.700]   in all these so-called deadly sins.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.240]   The larger question is, what happens in the human heart
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.520]   when all of these good things given by God
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.620]   become sinful things, what happens?
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.520]   And that really is the right way to ask Jan's question,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.280]   I think, about the definition of gluttony.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   Gluttony is the sinful enjoyment of the good gift of food.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.000]   So what happened?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.720]   What made it sinful?
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.520]   So answering that question, I think, is what gluttony is.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.040]   One of the historical ways of talking about those sins
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.160]   is that they are disordered loves,
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.720]   or another way is to say inordinate loves.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.040]   They start with legitimate love,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.680]   proper and proportional and Christ-exalting
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.440]   and God-rooted love for something innocent and good
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.520]   that God has given for our enjoyment,
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.160]   and then they become improper, disproportionate,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.840]   they cease to exalt Christ,
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.040]   they cease to have their root in God.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.320]   And the two passages that have helped me get my head
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.200]   around the biblical way of talking about this
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   are 1 Timothy 6, 6-10, and Philippians 4, 11-13,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.960]   and chapter three, verse eight.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.040]   So just a quick glance at those.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.880]   Paul says in 1 Timothy 6, 6,
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.360]   that godliness with contentment is great gain,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.280]   and that contentment is contentment in God.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.480]   And this is precisely what acts as the governor
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.000]   or the moderator or the regulator
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.120]   or the guide in all of our other desires.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.120]   So when Paul gets to verse 10, he says about money,
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.080]   which in itself is not an evil,
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.560]   it's given for our proper use,
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.120]   and he says, "The love of money
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.080]   is a root of all kinds of evils.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.960]   It is through this craving that some have wandered away
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.480]   and pierced themselves with many pangs."
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.160]   So what happened?
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.040]   The use of money governed by a sweet, deep,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.320]   pervasive contentment in God
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.400]   has been replaced by the loss of that contentment
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.800]   and the emergence of a powerful love for money
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.320]   and craving for money, as Paul calls it.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.320]   So the use of money has been disconnected
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.640]   or uncoupled from contentment in God.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.040]   And without that tether,
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.480]   a legitimate desire has begun to run rampant
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.800]   and is about to destroy the soul.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.360]   That's what happens in the use of all good things
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.480]   when they start to go bad.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.800]   Supreme contentment or happiness or joy or satisfaction
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   in God ceases to be the great guide
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.840]   or ballast or moderator or regulator of our souls.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.960]   And when that goes, everything goes bad.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.880]   The other text is Philippians 4,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.400]   where Paul says in verse 11,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.240]   "Not that I'm speaking of being in need,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.760]   I've learned in whatever situation I am to be content.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.320]   I know how to be brought low.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.880]   I know how to abound in any and every circumstance.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.560]   I've learned the secret of facing plenty
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.960]   in hunger, abundance, and need.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.480]   I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.160]   So Paul is describing here the secret
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.840]   of a godly Christian life.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.160]   And that would include the secret of the proper use of food
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.680]   and money and rest
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.200]   and all the other good gifts of God.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   And he says that this secret enables him to be content
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.880]   when he has a lot or when he has little.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.880]   So clearly the contentment doesn't lie
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.600]   in the particular thing
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.880]   and how much of it you have or don't have.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.120]   This is the secret of the Christian life.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.440]   And what is it?
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.000]   And the answer is back in chapter three, verse eight,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.640]   where he says, "I count everything as loss
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.120]   because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.960]   My Lord, for his sake, I have suffered the loss
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.800]   of all things.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.440]   Count them as rubbish in order that I might gain Christ."
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.000]   So the secret of Paul's contentment
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.040]   is the satisfaction that he finds in Jesus,
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.440]   a satisfaction that is so profound and so pervasive
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.600]   that even if everything else is lost,
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.080]   he doesn't lose this contentment or this satisfaction.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.960]   So when contentment in God or contentment in Christ,
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.120]   as Paul describes it in these two passages,
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.440]   is present in our lives,
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.300]   then it functions as a wonderful governor and moderator
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.680]   and regulator and guide and control
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.320]   on the use of all good things.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.320]   So they themselves remain good things in their proper place.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.000]   And when they are enjoyed,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   they are enjoyed as expressions of God's goodness to us.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.280]   So I would define gluttony then as the enjoyment of food
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.240]   that has become untethered from contentment in God
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.820]   as the governing love of our life.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.280]   As long as contentment, while contentment in God is fading,
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.800]   food is starting to take its place.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.520]   And there are several evidences that this is happening.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.400]   Number one, we become indifferent to the harmful effects
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.920]   that the food is having on the temple of the Holy Spirit,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.120]   our body.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.360]   Number two, we become indifferent
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.000]   to the way we're stewarding our money
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.280]   as we spend unwisely on wrong foods.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.600]   Number three, we start using food as an escape
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.120]   from our problems and a kind of medication
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.120]   for our sadness or our misery or discomfort.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.480]   Or number four, we stop enjoying food
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.360]   as a way of enjoying God.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.480]   We stop tasting the goodness of God
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.920]   in the goodness of the food.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.980]   And we start replacing the goodness of God
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.760]   with the goodness of the food.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.120]   So that's what I think gluttony is.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.220]   That's what the signs are that it's present.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.220]   And the way back may involve many external controls
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   and disciplines outside, but in the end,
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.760]   the only way out will be when God himself,
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.740]   through Jesus Christ, becomes our satisfying soul food
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.620]   and contentment in him becomes the governor
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.960]   and the regulator of all our appetites and desires.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.680]   - Yes, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.080]   And for more on this theme, see our ebook, "Killjoys,"
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.500]   and the chapter on gluttony,
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.280]   which was written by Jonathan Bowers.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.640]   You can download the book, "Killjoys,"
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.640]   at desiringgod.org/books and see chapter seven.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.580]   It's very helpful, and Bowers is a wonderful writer.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.280]   Well, we close out the week with a question
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.400]   about whether the cross of Jesus proves our inherent value.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.840]   It's an important question and a question
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.480]   John Piper has faced for over 40 years.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.040]   We'll hear from him tomorrow.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.520]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.480]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.640]   (upbeat music)
