[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   [Music]
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.840]   Moving on, we have a question from Noah.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.880]   Noah is asking about time blocking.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.160]   He says, "How do you time block plan within a company culture
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.360]   that's apt to throw a meeting on your calendar if it's marked as free?"
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.200]   Well, honestly, Noah, what you really need to do here is take
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.760]   all your colleagues in this company,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.000]   lock them in a room like in the first Saw movie,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.360]   but instead of them having to cut the leg off of someone else to get out of that room,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.320]   they have to read A World Without E-mail before you'll give them any water.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.480]   And I think then you'll solve your problem because I hate these type of cultures.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.480]   It's a huge issue and I feel your pain.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.280]   Let's just start there.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.880]   So long term, that's going to be your solution is, of course, you want to change this culture.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.840]   This is an ad hoc, on-demand, haphazard approach to work.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.800]   It's the hyperactive, hive mind personified.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.280]   It's an approach to work where you just rock and roll.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.000]   Oh, I want to do this.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.120]   Let's get a meeting on the books.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.160]   Let's shoot an email to this person.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.360]   Let's grab this person by Slack.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.920]   What about that?
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.240]   I don't know.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.520]   Let's just jump on and have a meeting.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.240]   Let's do a call.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.360]   Let's circle around on this.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.240]   Let's circle back.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.880]   Let's jump on.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.560]   Whatever the different terminology is, right?
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.760]   Just grabbing time and attention on-demand, haphazardly as needed
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.320]   to advance whatever it is that you're working on or interested in
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.400]   with the minimal amount of overhead for you.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.440]   We know that this does not scale when you apply this approach to a whole organization.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.200]   What you get out of it is a fraction of the potential output.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.640]   It is the knowledge work equivalent of running a car factory where you say, look, guys,
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.200]   I don't want to tell you how to do your job.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.040]   So everyone just rock and roll.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.320]   Let's try to get some cars built.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.120]   You know, if you need someone to help you with whatever you're working on, just grab them.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.640]   You know, yeah, you would produce some cars, but Henry Ford is going to outproduce you a thousand times.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.680]   All right.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.800]   So that's long-term solution.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.560]   Short-term, there are some hacks we can call them that help you get a little bit more breathing
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.600]   room in this culture while you're still waiting for the culture itself to change.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.640]   Both of the hacks I'm going to suggest for you revolve around protecting time on your
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.440]   shared calendar so that it can't be grabbed for meetings.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.920]   And there is a proactive and reactive way to doing this because
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   you can't just block off all your free time.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.600]   So the proactive approach is block off some time to protect yourself.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.360]   You can't block off all your free time.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.960]   If you block off all your free time, there's no time left for any meetings
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.800]   in a work culture like you work in, people aren't going to tolerate that.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.080]   So I don't want to give you this false hope of like,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.600]   just take all your time and block it off so people can't bother you with meetings.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.320]   So block off some.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.760]   Okay, I know I have this hour and these two hours.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.680]   I know what I'm doing in those two hours and it's protected.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.560]   So at least my biggest deep work priorities get progressed made up.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.600]   But you also have to leave a lot of time free for the meetings that still have to happen.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.120]   Now, here's where things get tricky.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.240]   You can't simply say, this is the ideal amount of time I want to spend on meetings each week
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.440]   and then leave exactly that much time free because you have to give flexibility to your colleagues.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.760]   They need to have options because their schedule is different than yours.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.000]   And you have to find times that works for everyone.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.640]   So yes, you can proactively block off some blocks.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.920]   This is busy time, you focus on deep work in that time.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.080]   At the very least, you know, that time will be spent with deep work.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.840]   But you probably have to leave a substantial amount of your time free.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.760]   Not that you want to fill all that time with meetings,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.280]   but you need to give enough options that you can actually find meeting times that
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.480]   work with other people.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.720]   Again, if you have one hour free each day, people aren't going to tolerate this because
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.560]   that is effectively no time for each day because it's not going to align with two or three people's
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.200]   other schedule.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.320]   This then puts us into a tragedy of the common situation, though, where you're now leaving,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.960]   let's say half your day free so that there's flexibility
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.080]   for scheduling the meetings that have to happen.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.640]   But when everyone sees half your day is free, now everyone's going to come and try to grab as
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.120]   much of that time as possible and you have too many meetings on the books.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.760]   So that second hack I'm going to give here is reactive time protection.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.840]   The way I work with reactive time protection is in response to every meeting that gets
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.120]   scheduled on a day, immediately go and block off and protect an equal duration meeting for
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.920]   just your own time.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.440]   So if someone comes in on Tuesday, let's say you have you've proactively protected about
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.680]   half your day on Tuesdays, half your day free.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.640]   And someone comes in like, okay, we need to use some terrible phrase like we need to circle
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.600]   back on a call that we jump on to go over the Q4 deck on our quarterly objectives, right?
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.800]   Or whatever the terrible thing is.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.160]   All right.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.400]   You have the whole afternoon free so that there's flexibility here and pretty easily
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.960]   the people involved in this meeting find a time.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.160]   They find like three o'clock free.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.400]   And so you're not the jerk that has no time free.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.800]   Great.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.160]   So now you have an hour, 3 to 4 p.m. for that meeting.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.640]   Immediately block off another hour that afternoon just for you.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.560]   So maybe four to five.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.280]   All right, now let's say someone else comes along and, you know, whatever they need to
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.840]   work on their, their, whatever it is, we need to slack on the client Q4 agenda.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.000]   When are you free on Tuesday, they look at the available time and they block from 12
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.040]   to one to do that call.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.560]   And again, you have some good flexibility here.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.200]   That's fine.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.520]   You say, great, I'm going to now take another hour, maybe two to three.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.760]   Boom.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.600]   And that's for me, I'm going to make that protected time.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.960]   Now, if someone else wants to meet on Tuesday, there is a little bit of time free, but it
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.600]   might not work.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.360]   And they're going to have to move that meeting to another day.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.760]   What you have effectively done here is implemented a dynamic system that said, I'm
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.480]   willing to have a couple hours of meetings in this afternoon.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.840]   And I want to have flexibility of when those can fall so that people won't think I'm a
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.160]   jerk.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.360]   I don't want to be the roadblock to figuring out times that work, but I only want two hours
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.240]   of meetings.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.560]   This reactive scheduling hack basically implemented that system.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.520]   Two meetings fit.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.800]   You were very flexible about where they went, but the rest of the time ended up protected.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   And so I think this is a way that you can deal with shared work cultures without the
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.360]   unsustainable approach of let me block most of my time off in advance.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.640]   And so you can give that a try.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.720]   But again, your ultimate solution is going to be locking your colleagues in a room, chain
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.280]   them to the wall.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.760]   They have to answer a 10 question detailed quiz correctly about a world without email
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:32.160]   before you're going to turn on the light and let them out.
