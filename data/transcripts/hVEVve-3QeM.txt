[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Hi there, my name is Jeremy Howard
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   I'm a research scientist at the University of San Francisco, and I'm a co-founder of fast AI
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.700]   I'm also on the global AI Council at the World Economic Forum and
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.080]   As you can see I'm doing today a crafting video. I think it's fair to say this will be the first and only
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.960]   Crafting video I do it's not exactly my area focus
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.360]   But I'm doing it because there's something really really important to know about and the important thing is this a bit of crafting
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.280]   Could actually help you stop the spread of COVID-19 in your community
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.360]   Here's what we know
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.360]   See these regions here
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.880]   They're all around China the epicenter of the the regional epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.180]   These areas are Mongolia South Korea Hong Kong and Taiwan
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.040]   These areas have something in common. They have very very few deaths from COVID-19
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.800]   Also, their economies are extraordinarily unimpacted
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.960]   They're not exactly going around their daily business in the usual way. There's social distancing
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.760]   But on the whole life is going on much as usual there at least compared to many other parts of the world
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.600]   How are they doing this? How have they got deaths down so much?
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.120]   Without destroying their economy and day-to-day life as much as we are
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.920]   Well, they're doing a lot of things, right? They've got a fantastic
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.000]   testing in place contact tracing
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.180]   Quarantine systems for those who might be infected but there's one other thing that they all have in common. It's really interesting
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.700]   They all have universal mask wearing amongst the general population in public
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.200]   It's just totally normal for people to wear masks there in a situation like this. They've had pandemics before they know how to deal with it and
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.680]   For example in Hong Kong you are not allowed to enter a shop if you are not wearing a mask
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.020]   It's both socially expected and often legally required
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.420]   Is this the reason that things are looking so much better in these countries?
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.980]   We don't know for sure, but what we do know is that they have a recipe for something that's working
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.960]   So maybe we should follow that recipe. I'll tell you what else we found
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:19.200]   I've had a look at 38 scientific papers on this topic which are related to the question of can wearing masks help
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.640]   delay slow down and maybe eventually stop
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:32.080]   transmission of COVID-19 in the community and the answer is it sure looks like they can by 50 to 75 percent just an amazing difference
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.480]   Now
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.660]   There's a few differences though. Should we be wearing masks?
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.360]   Here in the US where I am in Australia where I'm from originally in the UK where my family's from
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.160]   Well, there's some problems. The first and biggest problem is there's a shortage of what's called n95 respirators
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.580]   The hospital specific masks that people might be most familiar with there's not enough
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.520]   But people are frontline medical workers in hospitals. This is a huge problem
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.900]   because Oxford University has
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.320]   Put out advice that says in a hospital situation when you're doing a procedure called an aerosol generating procedure
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.260]   It's really important. You have an n95 respirator a real proper hospital mask
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.320]   Otherwise you can get infected because there's kind of this spray of virus infected droplets that hang in the air
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.120]   Here's something else though that Oxford says even in a hospital situation
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.220]   You don't really need to wear these n95 respirators
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.360]   Just a regular cloth mask in hospitals. They call it a surgical mask is quite enough and the reason for this
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   is that this
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.680]   illness seems to mainly be spread through droplets that fly out of our mouth when we're talking just like this or
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.560]   If we cough or if we yawn and in fact, there's some research from Stanford and MIT
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.880]   Which has been supported by the Nobel Prize-winning virologist Harold Varmus
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.480]   that actually has looked in a machine like this where they look at a
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.080]   Laser beam at what happens and they can actually watch these tiny
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.880]   Droplets fly out of your mouth and go two meters or more six feet to my American friends
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.160]   So what can you do? Well, you can actually cover your mouth with pretty much any kind of cloth
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.720]   Cambridge University has actually looked at this and they found that two layers of cotton work pretty well and
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:42.080]   the scientists from Shenzhen Hospital have studied different types of material under an electron microscope and found that
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.640]   Paper towel is actually
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.120]   perfect for this
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.040]   so
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.720]   So question number one could we start wearing masks without taking them away from frontline medical stuff? Yes, we could we could make them at home
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.720]   Using paper towels and or cotton material in sheets t-shirts so forth
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.640]   Question number two would we really do that in the West because in the West we don't have a culture of mask wearing
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.880]   turns out the answer is yes, we can an
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:20.600]   Absolutely amazing inspiring campaign kicked off by a science communicator named Peter Ludwig in the Czech Republic proves. This is true
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.840]   He put out the word and he said hey
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.520]   Places that are wearing masks
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.480]   Have far less deaths. Maybe we should do it too. Here's some scientific research that shows this. Come on
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   Let's make this happen and it went viral
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:44.040]   There was songs about it videos about it influences showing themselves wearing homemade masks within three days
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.960]   Nearly everybody in the Czech Republic had a mask
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.360]   It got to the point within days where if you went out without a mask people in your community would look at you and think
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.920]   What is this person's problem? Why are they going around my community without a mask putting me at risk?
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.400]   The message that was sent in that in the Czech Republic
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:13.000]   Social media and amongst influences was my mask protects you your mask protects me
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.880]   Well, this is super super important
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.120]   And so if you go out with your mask eventually people in your community are going to know
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.400]   You're protecting them. You're helping them and the science suggests you may well be helping yourself as well
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.360]   But why don't we do this? Why don't we follow this established recipe that has worked in the Czech Republic?
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.640]   Slovakia went on to do it as well in Austria now as of today
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.440]   There are laws that require you to wear a mask when you're shopping
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.800]   Germany's peak medical body has just announced that they're recommending that everybody uses masks as well
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.840]   So how do you make your own? Well, here's where the crafting comes in
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.280]   well, this is based on a recipe I found from a
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.700]   Czech video blogger and what she did is she showed how to use a
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.320]   T-shirt so if you start with a cotton t-shirt, then you're using the fabric that Cambridge University
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.560]   Noticed worked so well and specifically here. We've got two layers because it's a t-shirt, right?
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.480]   and so you can see what I've done here is I've
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.680]   drawn with chalk a line just underneath the armpits and
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.400]   Another line that goes from just inside the sleeve past the sleeve seam and back out again
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.600]   Another line that goes along the top of the seam of the t-shirt
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.040]   Underneath the neck to the other end and then there's another one
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:42.080]   Just here after this other arm. Well, of course the wind would have to come start blowing just as I start doing this video
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.160]   But of course, I can't do it inside because I have a four-year-old and wants to talk to me and you don't want to hear
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.080]   She thinks about this at the same time that I'm trying to talk. So we go ahead and cut from underneath here straight through
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:01.240]   All the way to the end
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:10.760]   Yeah, and then for the arm
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   We'll cut
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.360]   You see that there
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.360]   So I will cut
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.960]   If it comes out, okay on the video, but otherwise you can see where the cut is
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:29.960]   So I'm just starting underneath the seam here or underneath the fold I should say and then I come all the way through
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:39.640]   This past this join in the fabric and then I do the same on the other side adding just above
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.400]   Coming through to the join in the fabric
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.600]   And I can go ahead and make those join up
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:55.040]   That's not my forte I'm getting there
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:02.400]   We go. Well, this is what the bit I've cut out looks like, right and
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.240]   so you don't have to watch me doing the other one because I'm so damn slow is one that
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:16.080]   And here is what it looks like
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   Okay
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   Okay, so that's the mask right and
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.480]   You can see here. One other thing I've done is at the bottom is I've popped a
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.840]   Little safety pin now. Why have I done that?
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:36.800]   That's because we're going to take advantage of that Shenzhen hospital research electron microscope research that shows that a paper towel works
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.480]   So well, but what you do is I've got two pieces of cotton here, right?
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.960]   So you just pop a little piece of paper towel between those and it'll just rest
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.480]   Here against this safety pin and here's how you put it on
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.760]   you actually
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:10:01.720]   Pop it over your nose and then it goes behind your head, right and then you can just tie it up behind your head
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:09.120]   And it can be kind of low down that's totally fine and here's the other cool bit, right?
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.800]   The original Czech blogger that did this had a ponytail. So we're particularly well
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.520]   I don't have a ponytail that you just go up a little
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:24.200]   And
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.600]   There's my mask
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.920]   so
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:34.020]   When I head outside I wear this in public, especially if there's any chance I might get within six feet of somebody
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:40.280]   Okay, and then at the end of the day at the end of my outing I should say come back. I'm tired
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.600]   right
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:51.760]   And then take out the piece of paper towel from between the two bits of a t-shirt and throw it in the trash and
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:59.000]   Then wash this with soapy water because what we know scientists have found is that soap
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Destroys the lipid layer that protects the virus. So so wash this with soap
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.920]   Now the other thing to realize is that as you've been breathing in and out
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:14.600]   If if you've come in contact with somebody who's infected or you're infected there could now be
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.320]   Virus particles in your mask or in that piece of paper we took out
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.520]   So that means that as we took it off, so when you take it off try not to touch more than you have to
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.040]   And then make sure you wash your hands before you touch anything else
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.480]   Right because you could have got some virus particles on your hands just as you took it on and off
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.180]   But here's the thing right if there's virus particles on here
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:44.340]   After your outing that means you came in contact with somebody in the virus and that means that the virus is in here and not in
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:50.140]   Your face and this virus actually comes in through the eyes and nose or the mouth
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:55.620]   And it's expelled mainly through the mouth. So the mask will protect others from the
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.620]   Live or ejected from your mouth when you're talking
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.020]   It'll protect your nose and mouth and if you want to protect your eyes as well
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:08.720]   You can pop on a pair of glasses or even goggles if you want to for that extra layer of protection
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.180]   So that's what you need to do. It's not enough for you to do it
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.840]   You need everybody in your community to do it if you can get this up to 75% of your community
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.360]   You will probably slash the transmission of the virus in your area
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.700]   particularly when this is combined with social distancing and washing and then
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:34.420]   Something that needs support from you know, a much wider group is then widespread testing
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:41.380]   Contact tracing and quarantine of people who might be infected. This is the recipe we know works from these countries
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.660]   It's around China. So let's all get into it and remember
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.980]   My mask protects you your mask protects me
