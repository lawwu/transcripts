[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.540]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.120]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.260]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.480]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.760]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.000]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.880]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.960]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.840]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.480]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.480]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.440]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.680]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.340]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.940]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you to this episode
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.920]   because I'm talking to one of my dearest friends
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.280]   about something that we both really love, and that's books.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.840]   I know as you launch you and your family into the summer,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.400]   as your homeschooling year has come to a close,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.480]   you are looking forward to a time of rest.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.240]   Maybe you're looking for some good stuff
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.760]   to do with your family this summer.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.240]   And some of you may be,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.680]   as you attend practicum this summer,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.700]   looking toward the fall and thinking about resources
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.420]   you could begin to gather now
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.080]   that would get your fall started off with a bang.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.860]   So I have Jennifer Courtney with me today,
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.100]   and I'm excited to talk to her about the books
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.020]   that could open the world for us.
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.860]   Jennifer, thanks for coming.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.380]   - Thanks for having me, Lisa.
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.180]   I always love talking about books.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.700]   - I know, and so we could go on and on.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.400]   And my job today will be to make sure
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.500]   that we don't go on and on,
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.840]   and that all of you who are listening
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.280]   can get this in a manageable bite
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.320]   of delightful conversation.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.560]   So, Jennifer, I do happen to know,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.400]   I knew in advance that you loved books
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.600]   and that you are devoted,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.120]   you and your family are devoted
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.520]   to reading and reading together.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.000]   What is the latest token of devotion in your home?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.720]   I actually know the answer to this,
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.280]   but I want you to share it with our listeners.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.640]   - Well, I finally realized a lifelong dream
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.320]   of having a library with lots and lots of bookshelves
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.040]   and one of those sliding ladders.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.240]   Truth be told, my ceiling in the library
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.520]   is probably not high enough to walk that ladder,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.920]   but I have always wanted one,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.640]   and my husband is very gracious
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.040]   and made that a reality.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.480]   And my daughter, my oldest daughter,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.400]   helped me over her Christmas break from college
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.040]   to inventory all of our books into an online system
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.760]   so that we have everything arranged and organized,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.400]   and we're actually lending out our books.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.440]   And so it was a whole family effort.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.800]   My mom and dad came down
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.360]   and we filled out the little white library cards in them.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.240]   I got a library stamp.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.360]   We covered them with protective plastic
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.640]   so that people can borrow them.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.800]   And I do have a few patrons right now.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.760]   I'm hoping now that it's more organized
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.800]   and we finished some renovation projects in our house
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.080]   that we can have even more folks coming
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.920]   and checking out our books.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.000]   - That is the most charming story to me,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.960]   I have to tell you.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.640]   When you started talking about
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.800]   that this was gonna become a reality,
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.760]   I was really excited.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.600]   But when I saw the pictures of the beautiful shelves
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.680]   and all your books on the shelves,
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.760]   and then when I saw the ladder that you guys put up,
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   I was filled with happiness for you and envy for myself.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.320]   And I just think that that is super cool.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.080]   And one of my favorite parts
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.240]   is that you are actually lending books
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.600]   to little readers in your sphere.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.400]   And I think that that is super cool.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.240]   - I know, I have one devoted little reader
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.240]   who loves these 1950s mysteries called the Happy Hollisters.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.000]   And they're about a family of five children and their dog
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.120]   who solve little mysteries.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.960]   And she comes every two weeks
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.600]   and gets her next few Happy Hollisters.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.440]   And then I collected up a bunch of landmark history books
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   from the 1950s that are biographies of famous Americans,
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.760]   Dolly Madison, Daniel Boone.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.680]   And then I also collected the ones
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.360]   that were about world history.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.280]   So there's Shakespeare and his globe
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.480]   and Cleopatra and things like that.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.680]   And so I have had some CC essential students.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.160]   - I bet so.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.400]   - Faces of history and get biographies
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.280]   that they could read that go with our cycles.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.920]   So that's fun for me too.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.320]   - That is really cool.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.920]   I suspect that that is the series
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.640]   that I used to check out of my church library.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.880]   'Cause I went through a period, one summer at least,
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.520]   where all I read was biographies.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.000]   And so I suspect it was that very series.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.240]   That is really cool.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.080]   I love it.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.160]   I love that you've got that and that you share that.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.040]   Now I know, like the first time I ever saw the movie,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.440]   The Beauty and the Beast, I did not want The Beast.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.080]   I did not want The Prince.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.640]   I wanted that library.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.960]   And still, when that picture,
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   when he pulls back the tattered curtain
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.800]   and you see the library,
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.240]   every time I see it, I still gasp.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.080]   - I know.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.040]   - That is my dream.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.560]   I will not ever have it 'cause my ceiling is not that high.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.400]   - I know.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.960]   - But I absolutely love it.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.320]   So let me ask you this,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.240]   'cause I can remember also wanting a library
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.320]   when I was a little girl.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.160]   And of course, I always wanted the latter.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.640]   Not just when I was a grownup, but when I was little,
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.720]   did you have lots of books around you
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.760]   when you were growing up?
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.800]   When you were a little girl,
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.080]   did you have lots of books in your home?
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.360]   - Yes, I did.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.440]   So my dad's family particularly were readers
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.240]   and they passed down some of the books
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.440]   that he and his brothers had read.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.440]   I seem to be the one in the family who inherits all of this.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.280]   - Who gets the stuff.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.800]   - So I have one that is just precious to me
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.400]   called "Children from Around the World," which was-
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.600]   - I have that book.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.440]   - Do you?
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.280]   It's so lovely.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.120]   - Yes.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.000]   - I love, love, love old children's books.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.280]   And that one is precious.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.200]   It talks about little customs in each country.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.600]   And that was sort of my first introduction to globalism.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.040]   But we did, we were at home where we had lots and lots
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.880]   of books.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.960]   I think I've shared this story before on the podcast,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.800]   but my mother was educated at the time of whole language
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.400]   instead of phonics instruction.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.840]   And she still claims that that made her a slow reader.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.760]   And she was determined for me and my brother
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.120]   not to be a slow reader.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.120]   And so every week when I got my allowance,
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.920]   she took us to Little Professor Bookstore.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.400]   Isn't that the cutest name?
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.840]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.360]   - It doesn't exist anymore, sadly,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.800]   but we would go to Little Professor Bookstore
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.640]   and spend our allowance buying whatever series
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.760]   we were wildly in love with at that time.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.480]   So I have all of those books.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.520]   My parents moved a lot for my dad's work.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.080]   And I'm very grateful that my mother continued
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.320]   to move the books around and hold onto them for us.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.280]   So I have all of those in the library
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.480]   as well as the ones I'm adding.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.680]   - That is so cool.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.920]   I have made myself a note that if I ever get my own library,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.160]   maybe I'll call it Little Professor's Library.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.480]   That is just the sweetest thing.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.160]   So your family had lots of books.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.440]   I'm always amazed when I go into somebody's home
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.120]   and there aren't a lot of books.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.080]   Like I can't, like we have all the rooms in our house.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.280]   I mean, the bathrooms, the kitchen,
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.000]   all of the rooms in our house, maybe not the laundry room,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.640]   but all the other rooms in our house have books.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.760]   And I'm always amazed when I go visit someone
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.200]   who doesn't have a lot of books.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.960]   And I think that my children were always amazed
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.920]   when they went to visit friends
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.520]   who didn't have as many books
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.200]   'cause my kids had books of their own
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.720]   even when they were little.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.760]   Do you remember the first book
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.120]   that belonged completely to you?
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.000]   - Yes, and I'm gonna butcher the title.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.160]   It was this really, in the '70s,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.240]   they made these horribly unsturdy books for children
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.200]   that were like (indistinct)
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.600]   and it was something like "My Little Red Shoes"
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.000]   and it was about a little girl searching high and low
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.120]   for her little red shoes to wear out
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.040]   and she kept finding everyone else's shoes
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.040]   and trying them on and they didn't work for her.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.240]   And finally she found the little red shoes.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.280]   I think they were under the crib or something.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.720]   - Yes.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.440]   - And I just remember reading that book with my parents.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.320]   I have fond memories of that little book.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.280]   - That's fun.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.200]   And why did you love it?
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.160]   Just 'cause it made a family memory,
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.640]   a warm memory of being bred to or family time?
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.080]   - I think it was partly that.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.080]   I think that storyline also really appeals to children
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.120]   because although that book is lost to us,
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.240]   my children had a love for a similar book
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.400]   that was called "D.W.'s Glasses."
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.240]   - Oh, yes.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.520]   - In that book, D.W. tries on all kinds of different glasses
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.800]   including some that had windshield wipers on them for rain.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.680]   And my kids just,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.200]   I think it's that variety of funny choices
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.600]   of things that you would be on
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.440]   that kids really gravitate to that story.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.560]   - That's fun, that's fun.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.760]   I love things that allow their imaginations to soar
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.520]   and that hit their funny bone.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.680]   Even when they're little,
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.440]   they can recognize the ridiculous or the comical
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.040]   or the sort of outside what could be true,
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.080]   but I'd like to imagine it.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.480]   That's kind of cool.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.480]   So did you continue to amass your own collection of books?
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.440]   - Yes.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.760]   And in fact, besides our trips to Little Professor Books,
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.720]   and my grandparents, the ones who were readers,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.560]   gave us hardbacks every year for Christmas.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.760]   That was one of our special gifts.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.040]   And of course I grew up in the era
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.400]   when you could go to the Scholastic Book Fair
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.240]   and it was okay.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.640]   - Oh my gosh, that was the best day of the year in school.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.640]   - It was the best day.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.400]   I still have my box set of "Little House on the Prairie"
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.520]   books from the Scholastic Book Fair.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.880]   But I also would go to garage sales.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.680]   And one of the books that is lost to me that I really miss
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   was a fifth grade reader of all things.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.520]   - Oh my gosh, yes.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.720]   - It was an old school book,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.440]   but it had really charming stories in it.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.360]   And that some of them were science stories
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.200]   about how pollywogs turned into frogs.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.320]   And some of them were retellings of Greek myths.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.760]   But I adored that little book
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.880]   and had it for years and years.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.400]   And I think I paid a quarter for it at a garage sale.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.800]   - You know what?
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.400]   I remember, I liked those kind of collections of books too.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.760]   And I can remember that my elementary school
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.120]   had a book sale and they were getting rid of,
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.120]   and some of them, I guess, were just reading textbooks
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.120]   and they had collections of stories like that.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.040]   And I remember my family buying some to have at home.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.360]   And for a while, some of those were my favorite books
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.680]   'cause they had lots of stories.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.560]   It was like one book, but lots of stories.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.920]   And I did love that.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.200]   So why would you,
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   if you were gonna talk to a young parent just starting out
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:16.520]   and maybe a new mom or dad who did not grow up
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.920]   with a house full of books,
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.880]   and maybe they went to the library and checked out books,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.920]   but took them back
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.840]   and they didn't have a library at their home,
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.440]   but now they think they want something different
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.200]   for their family.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.880]   Why, what would you tell that young parent?
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.280]   Why should we build libraries at home?
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.480]   - Yeah, well, one reason, of course,
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.720]   is that children who have libraries at home
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.440]   do become readers.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.880]   If you read Jim Trulisa's book,
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.400]   the Read Aloud Handbook,
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   statistics show that homes that have lots of books in them,
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   whether or not people open them,
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.040]   those households become better readers.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.960]   I find that an interesting statistic.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.640]   But also I would say that,
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.480]   and I did use the library at school
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.160]   and the public library quite a bit growing up,
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.640]   but there is something about having those favorites
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.240]   that you read and reread and reread.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.560]   So I was on a family trip
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.800]   and a friend of a friend of a cousin,
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.280]   that's a very loose connection,
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.440]   happened to come over to my aunt and uncle's one night
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.200]   and she gave me a hardback copy of Little Women.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.120]   And I couldn't believe that she was willing to part with it
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.520]   and that it was being given to me.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.200]   And I had a tradition
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.160]   where I read that on my birthday every year
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.040]   from the year that she gave it to me on.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.720]   And so I think that partly having a library at home
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.840]   is about cultivating an atmosphere of reading,
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.120]   but it's also that you have your favorites
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.440]   that you want to savor over and over again.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.760]   And now I think we're in a stage
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.160]   where we're preserving printed books.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.360]   I've talked to a lot of parents
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.000]   who are borrowing things from my library
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.920]   who say that they go to the public library
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.440]   and there aren't books anymore
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.680]   because so many resources have become digitized.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.680]   And so their kids are longing
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.560]   to find these good old books that they,
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.760]   and the parents don't have to vet
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.040]   the books that are in my library
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.560]   'cause I've vetted them all.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.760]   - Right, right.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.160]   - They're age appropriate and good and wholesome.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.400]   And so that's been nice.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.640]   - Those are all great reasons.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.280]   And if I didn't already have a library at home
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.960]   that my children used
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.040]   and that I am continuing for grandchildren,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.960]   I would want to do it for those reasons.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.800]   I love that.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.000]   Create an atmosphere, create some connections,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.080]   value the printed resources,
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.240]   and then just know that you've got a collection
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.000]   that has been approved, that's vetted.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.160]   It's not scandalous,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.520]   but also it's not just what you're running away from,
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.920]   it's what you're running toward.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.160]   You're able to build a collection
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.600]   that talks about noble character
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.080]   or becoming curious or being adventurous
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.080]   or being kind.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.480]   I really like that.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.480]   What do you think?
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.680]   What does creating or collecting good books
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.880]   teach our children?
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.120]   Because I know that our children
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.240]   watched us and they still watch us.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.600]   One year, my husband and I decided to see
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.080]   if we could go a month without buying a book.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.720]   And I know you're laughing,
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.480]   and it didn't last a week.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.320]   And I really think that probably a week doesn't go by still
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.560]   that we don't buy some kind of a book.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   What does collecting good books teach our children?
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.560]   - Well, definitely what you collect
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.960]   says something about what you value.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.800]   And so I think we're setting an example
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.720]   that this is important, this activity that we're doing.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.760]   But it also communicates that you love them.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.760]   I have a love relationship with the books in my home.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.960]   And so the children, I think, see that modeled for them,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.160]   that it is lovely to own a book and read a book
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.600]   and share it with your family.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.960]   - Do you think having lots of books at home
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:30.840]   when your kids were little taught them how to be readers?
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.640]   - I think so.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.800]   And for some of them, it came later than others.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.800]   So I'm certainly not suggesting that this is a magic bullet
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.560]   that you will have all these books at home
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.920]   and all of your children
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.280]   will just bury themselves in them all the time.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.800]   Some of mine came to love reading later.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.880]   Some of them, a couple of them actually
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:57.440]   didn't read much outside of their assigned curriculum
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.400]   until they were in college.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.200]   And then they realized how much they missed
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.880]   reading lovely books.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   - Oh, yes.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.280]   - So they began anew.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.840]   - I like that.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.760]   - And I think some really- - I really like that.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.160]   - Yeah, it's been nice for me.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.280]   Sometimes they went back and reread things
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.440]   that they read in challenge.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.960]   So my son particularly has been rereading his way
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.560]   through C.S. Lewis
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.560]   and wanting to really go back and remember those ideas
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.960]   and those conversations that he had with his community.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.000]   And also he's sharing that he's much more mature now.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.640]   And so these things have a different meaning for him.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.400]   - I love that.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.960]   I love how what we do with our children when they're young
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.400]   becomes an echo that they hear.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.320]   Sometimes, like you said, across the years,
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.200]   and it calls them back to what was lovely
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.200]   or warm or challenging or special in some way.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.080]   That's cool.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.480]   - Yeah, and sometimes I enjoy being librarian.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.280]   So earlier this week, Mia was about to go on a trip
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.840]   and she was flopped down on the Shays Lounge in the library.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.840]   And I said, "Be sure to grab a book for your trip."
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.160]   'Cause she's going to visit her sisters
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.480]   and they have to work some.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.000]   And she kind of just looked up and she was very tired.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.240]   She'd just gotten home from camp.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.800]   And I said, "Are you looking at me like that
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.200]   "because you need help choosing a book?"
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.880]   And then we had a lovely conversation where I said,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.160]   I got to really be librarian, I felt like.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.000]   I was asking her questions about
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.560]   what are you in the mood for?
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.760]   And let me find one that I've handpicked for you
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.680]   based on what you're wanting to read.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.840]   That was really fun for me.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.320]   - That is really fun.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.160]   I love that.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.160]   I love knowing enough about a lot of different kinds of books
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.520]   that you can help somebody find something
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.900]   that will delight them in the moment.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.760]   That's really fun, I like that.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.240]   Let me ask you this.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   I titled this podcast, "Open a Book, Open the World."
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.960]   How do books open the world?
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.680]   'Cause I believe they do
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.480]   and I'm pretty sure you believe they do.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:24.480]   - Yeah, so like you, I read aloud to my kids every day
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.920]   when we were home educating
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.380]   and I tried to continue that practice well into high school.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.000]   And just, it got harder to grab time since they got older
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.320]   but we made it a priority in our home.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.460]   And I think back to some of those books
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.080]   that really opened the world for them.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.440]   And sometimes it's because they were
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.560]   about someone who lived a very different life from us.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.480]   So I remember Benjamin Loving Henry Huggins
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.640]   who basically lived in the 1950s in Oregon.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.080]   And that was very different from our life here
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.520]   in the 2000s in Oklahoma.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.920]   And he loved reading about Henry
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.760]   and the adventures that he got to have.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.560]   One of the unfortunate consequences
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.040]   of us reading about Henry Huggins
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.840]   is that Henry grew up in a different time
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.320]   and he was allowed to take the bus into the city
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.440]   and go to the Y and go swimming
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.280]   and take the bus into the city to run errands for his mom.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.920]   And that made my son want to do that.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.040]   (laughing)
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.840]   Which wasn't a reality for us.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.480]   Of course, everyone, I think most people
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.620]   who have had the boxcar children read to them
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.080]   have fond memories of that one opening the world to them
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.440]   about making your own home and space.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.720]   And my girls made their own boxcar next door.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.520]   - Oh yes, oh yes.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.800]   - And so it tended to be that those books
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   that were so different from our experience
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.980]   were what opened the world to them.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.560]   We read through "Little House on the Prairie" multiple times
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.560]   and just thinking about those struggles
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.040]   that that family faced.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.800]   But then we also had nonfiction books
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.960]   that opened the world to them.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.760]   I had a little, they weren't anything special.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.160]   They were literally stapled books
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.700]   that I think I did get from Scholastic
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.360]   that were about the planets.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.760]   And my children read those over and over again
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.800]   about what is the planet made out of?
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.400]   What's the temperature like on the planet?
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.200]   How much would you weigh on the planet?
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.640]   And that opened up astronomy for them
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.480]   to read those little books.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.920]   And that brings up a really good point.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.920]   Books are not just good for wiling away a rainy afternoon.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.080]   So I do know that you read to your kids a lot
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.420]   and that they enjoyed a good story when you presented it.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.720]   But books are good and books that you have at home
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.280]   can be good for other things.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.160]   Like you said, introducing your children
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.800]   to the natural world, but doing research
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.800]   or answering questions or opening them up to curiosity
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.240]   about things they know nothing about,
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.160]   when they're little like physics or explosions
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.040]   or all kinds of things, piquing their curiosity.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.400]   Books are great for that.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.920]   - Yeah, and I think sometimes as homeschool parents,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   we feel pressured to have a set schedule
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.080]   and quote teach all these subjects.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.020]   And really an afternoon practice
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.780]   of allowing children to select books,
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:34.860]   they will naturally want to read about science
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.740]   and they will naturally want to read fiction.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.940]   So just having a few well-placed books
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.660]   is actually a better way
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.660]   than trying to cram in a bunch of subjects.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.580]   In fact, I was reading about,
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.300]   I'm always fascinated about people
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.880]   who did not have a chance to get a formal education
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.420]   and the ways they compensated for that.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.340]   And my favorite author, Dickens, was one of those people.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.260]   - Of course he was.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.180]   - Of course he was.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.780]   And his father got into financial trouble,
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.500]   which meant Dickens had to go to work
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.660]   younger than he wanted to.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.100]   And that's a pretty typical story
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.540]   in the history of the world, actually.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:18.540]   And he was so excited because in London at that time,
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.340]   when you turned 18,
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.520]   you could sign up to be a reader at the British Library.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.700]   And that is how he compensated for his education
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.860]   is he got a library card to the British Library,
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.140]   which is gigantic and has all you could ever want
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.940]   to put in it and then some.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.980]   And that's how he made up for his education.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.020]   And when you read his books,
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.260]   he has such a lively mind and a huge vocabulary.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.180]   So it's fun for me to think about him
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.520]   whiling away his spare hours in the British Library.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.300]   - Yeah, and you will learn a lot of stuff
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.580]   on the way through a good story.
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.420]   I know when I used to play,
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.180]   when we used to play Trivial Pursuit,
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.920]   sometimes my husband would look at me like I had two heads
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.420]   and say, "Why do you know that?"
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.100]   And I would be like, "I don't really know.
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.700]   "I think it was just, it was a random fact
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.040]   "in a mystery novel that I read when I was little."
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.740]   You know, there's all kinds of random facts
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.580]   that you pick up along the way to a good story.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.660]   - Absolutely.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.880]   - Okay, I know that lots of us
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.460]   are gonna spend time reading this summer.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.820]   You know, it's on everybody's to-do list.
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.300]   We're gonna spend time reading to ourselves.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.200]   We're gonna be reading with our kids.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.460]   Lots of us will be reading ahead
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.140]   as we prepare for the fall learning season.
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.900]   I suspect that you have some good suggestions
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.460]   for the readers among us.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:48.460]   So I want you to share some of your favorite summer reads
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:53.200]   or even a reading plan that really worked for you.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.360]   - Yeah, so every summer that I've been home educating
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.500]   my kids, which I did a tally to introduce myself yesterday
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.520]   at practicum, and that tally is at 22 years.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.220]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.920]   - That was a shocking number to me.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.100]   I have picked a devotional book
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.660]   and a classical education book
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.980]   and one subject book like Latin or science
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.860]   to get myself prepared for the next school year.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.060]   And one of my very favorite devotional books
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.420]   when my kids were small was "A Mother's Heart"
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.060]   by Jean Fleming.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.060]   That's a beautiful book for talking to,
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.660]   for introducing your children to Jesus around your home.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.780]   And I will always treasure that book.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.860]   I've read through most of the parent resources
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.580]   in the classical conversations catalog
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.820]   as my education reads.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.620]   So starting with something like the core
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.660]   and working your way up toward something
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.820]   like norms and nobility,
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.900]   but I read a classical education book every year
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.000]   and then tackled a different subject.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.180]   So I might be into biographies one summer
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.500]   or I might dive into Latin,
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.780]   but that was kind of how I organized my summer reading.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.740]   And then I always had something light
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.020]   and for those moments when my brain was tired.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.140]   And usually for me, that's a mystery series
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.060]   because I can let my brain shut off a little bit.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.580]   - Yeah, yeah, I always have to get,
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.700]   I have, I used to, when I was little, younger,
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.340]   I would only, I would read one book at a time
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.060]   and I would just like devour it.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.260]   Like I was power eating through this book.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.700]   I was just gonna swallow it whole.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.860]   And I only had one book going at a time.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.940]   As a grownup, I can't do that.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.340]   I mean, I'm reading for work.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.400]   I'm reading to grow in the Lord.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.920]   I'm reading as a teacher, you know,
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.780]   and then like you said, I'm reading for a brain break.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.700]   I'm reading something like that would be candy,
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.940]   you know, to my mouth.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.520]   And so I have lots of books going at the same time.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.520]   And so that's what I would say to parents and to families.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.340]   Dabble in a lot of things.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:16.020]   At the same time, you could enjoy reading a magazine.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.460]   You could enjoy reading a how-to book
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.580]   that would help your family do a project this summer.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.660]   You could be reading a devotional
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.600]   that would help you grow in the Lord as a parent.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.700]   You could be reading a devotional with your kids
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.020]   in the summer to help them on their way
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.200]   to learning what it means to belong to the Lord Jesus.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.500]   All kinds of things.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.260]   And you could be doing them all at the same time
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.420]   and have a really well-rounded reading diet.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.440]   I think that's cool.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.700]   All right, we know that we are,
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.020]   as Classical Conversations parents,
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.300]   finishing up our academic year.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.340]   But as we go to practicum and we hear about
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.740]   all the new books that are out there,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.740]   and as we look towards cycle one,
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.980]   some of us are thinking,
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.460]   if I could begin to gather some good stuff,
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.540]   then I'd be ready for the fall
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.260]   and I would not skid into August and feel frantic.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.260]   So share some of your favorite cycle one resources, okay?
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.940]   So those of you who have been involved
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.500]   in Classical Conversations for a while
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:38.500]   know that this coming fall, everybody everywhere
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.980]   in this next academic year will be in cycle one.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.540]   So Jennifer, tell us, what does that even mean?
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.020]   What is cycle one?
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.820]   And then share some of your favorite cycle one resources.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.900]   - Yeah, so we're all gonna be looking at ancient history
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.860]   and world history next year
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.620]   in the Classical Conversations Foundations program.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.820]   And my, I may be biased,
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.860]   but because I was involved in helping to make them,
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.980]   but I do love our Copper Lodge books that go with cycle one.
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.260]   And those include Ancient World Echoes,
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:19.260]   which is stories from Greece, Rome, China, and Africa,
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.820]   as well as a few other places.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.060]   So looking at stories that really came
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.740]   from the ancient world.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.660]   And then we have Exploring Insects with Uncle Paul.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.140]   And I love that we're encouraging our children
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.260]   to look down and see the multitude of life
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.740]   that God has made smallest level.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.860]   Kids love bugs.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.780]   Let's be honest, they love them.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.420]   And then Kings of Rome,
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.580]   which is those founding stories about the Roman Empire
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.140]   that are short and sweet
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.660]   and introduce our kids to that era of history.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.900]   So I love gathering up those kinds of things
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.500]   to read with my kids in the mornings
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.300]   when we're doing foundations.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.820]   And then, so we would gather and read those things.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.140]   So we would read,
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.340]   you can read Ancient World Echoes
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.580]   for a couple of mornings a week
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.660]   'cause there's two stories a week and one fable.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.540]   And then Uncle Paul and Kings of Rome
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:19.220]   lend themselves to reading on the off days of the week,
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.540]   if you want to spread them out like that,
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.740]   'cause there's one story a week from those.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.740]   And then I liked having the beautiful science
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.860]   and artist cards and timeline cards
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.260]   'cause we liked to look at the beautiful pictures
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.820]   while we were doing our memory work.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.140]   And then also read a little bit more on the back,
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.180]   just the stories that are on the back of the science cards
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.660]   and the composer cards and the history cards
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.100]   were fun for us to explore just a little deeper
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.940]   after we had recited our timeline or our history sentences.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.220]   - I like that.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.780]   We liked the cards with the pictures.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.020]   It appealed to my children's imaginations
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.540]   and they always found something in the picture
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.580]   that I didn't see, right?
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.660]   They're looking at it more closely than I am
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.540]   that made them ask a question
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.860]   or that stretched me to think more deeply about the picture,
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.460]   but also about what it said on the back of the card
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.500]   and what we were learning about that event
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.300]   from the history sentence, from the timeline song
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.860]   or from something else that we were reading that week.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.100]   So I like it that you mentioned some resources
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.540]   that aren't books that can still help us
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.540]   with what we're trying to explore
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.140]   with our children in cycle one.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:44.140]   What are some other resources that parents might enjoy
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.460]   that aren't necessarily books
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.820]   or even CC products?
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:55.820]   What other resources did you use as a parent
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:01.140]   to open the world to your children?
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:06.140]   - Well, costumes, of course, dress up.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.660]   One of mine really, really liked to dress up
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.260]   and so "Faces of History" was a favorite
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.420]   'cause that was a great opportunity.
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.900]   - Yes, oh, that's great, Jennifer.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.580]   - And then one of mine really loved to have,
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.180]   to make crafts for presentations.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.220]   And so having those craft supplies is part of,
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.580]   I always considered that part of our library.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:33.060]   We had good wall-sized maps always
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.300]   that we could see in front of us all the time.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.340]   And then we always had lots of colored pencils,
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:42.260]   crayons, modeling clay, Play-Doh, I mean, you name it.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.420]   We had all those supplies.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.060]   I miss that actually in my house.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.900]   I don't have anyone coloring anymore, so no crayons.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.980]   - Oh, I still have the craft closet.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.900]   Yeah, we had a craft closet and the girls knew
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:59.260]   anything in that except for glitter
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.260]   is open to use at all times without direct supervision.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.460]   Glitter was a restricted subject
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.300]   or was a restricted resource after a few mishaps.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:16.300]   But I agree with you, and that my girls knew
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.260]   that that was a place they could go
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.700]   and get whatever supply they needed
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.300]   that they could use as they re-imagined
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.060]   the lesson of the morning into their afternoon play,
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.780]   because that's what happened at our house.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.020]   Whatever we studied in the morning,
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:40.020]   I could look outside and find them enacting it.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:45.060]   In the afternoon, I love that, it's such a good idea
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:50.060]   that a resource like a craft or a costume,
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:55.500]   I think eventually I had no more white sheets in my home
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.740]   because they would come in and they would need a sheet
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.060]   and I would say, "Okay, are you going to cut it up
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.900]   "or draw on it?
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.460]   "Is this gonna be a sheet that I could ever use again?"
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.540]   And sometimes they're like, "Well, I really need to cut it
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.300]   "or I really need to tie it to this tree."
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.580]   And so I would know that the white sheet sets
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.980]   are not ever going to be intact again,
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.860]   but for them to have that, and so that's a great reminder
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.300]   that there are resources that aren't books
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.340]   that might be part of your, if not library,
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.100]   then at least your arsenal of materials.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.700]   I love that you said you always had math
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.940]   on your wall, talk about that.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.620]   What did you guys use the maps for
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.660]   when you weren't studying geography
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:47.740]   and trying to draw them or blob map?
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.300]   - Well, we used them all the time.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.540]   So if we were reading a story like Heidi,
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.220]   we had to go find Switzerland.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.300]   Where are we in the world when we're reading this story?
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.140]   So that was sometimes what we did,
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.180]   or we would read a biography of someone
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.180]   who fought in World War II,
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.580]   and we needed to go look up those locations.
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.340]   So that was a lot of, it was a good supplement
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.620]   to our reading because we liked to locate ourselves
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.820]   in the world when we were in trance.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.660]   - Yes.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.140]   And that is so awesome.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.580]   That is one of the best, best things
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:26.020]   about my daughter's classical education
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.740]   was that emphasis on geography,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.860]   which I don't really think I ever had as a student,
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:36.860]   that they memorized all those places in the world.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:42.340]   And it was such, it proved to be so much more
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.980]   than a parlor trick.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.220]   You know, it wasn't just that they could tell you
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:50.060]   the capitals of all the countries in Africa, okay?
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.940]   It became when they read a novel,
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.940]   or they read a biography, or they read a history book,
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:02.940]   they could immediately put the places mentioned
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.420]   into context.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.060]   They knew what it was close to.
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.100]   They knew what bodies of water were nearby
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.140]   and what mountain ranges separated it
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.980]   from another important place in that text.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.740]   And so, I feel like it gave them,
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:23.340]   the study of geography gave them a much better context
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.460]   for people and places in the world.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.580]   And even to today, when they hear news reports
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.620]   of what's going on,
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:37.620]   they have a much better mental picture than even I do
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.500]   of what that means in the world in which they live.
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.060]   - Yeah.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.780]   - I love it, I love it.
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.540]   I know that when my girls were little,
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.820]   we sometimes, I had to push them to see this,
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.140]   but we sometimes used people as resources.
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.300]   And so, I would think ahead to what we were studying
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.500]   and try to think of someone in our sphere
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.340]   who knew something about that, who worked as a scientist.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.700]   We had some friends who were chemists at the local college,
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.220]   and so they could talk to them about chemistry,
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:22.180]   and we had doctors who could talk to them about anatomy,
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.740]   and we had people who worked in local government
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.860]   who could tell them what it's really like
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.980]   to be on the town council and stuff.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.380]   And so, people can be resources.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.940]   And so, as parents, I would encourage you,
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.660]   when you're thinking ahead to the fall,
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.340]   think about what you're gonna study
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.500]   and what your children and you are going to explore
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.260]   and ask yourself, do I know any people
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.340]   who have that as a hobby or have that as a vocation?
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.900]   Is there anybody who could talk to my kids?
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.540]   Could my older children shadow somebody for a day
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:59.580]   and find out what this job is really all about?
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.660]   That's a good resource too.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:07.260]   Let me ask you this, think back, all right, back,
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.380]   'cause I know that your youngest
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.140]   is up into the challenge area years now,
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.140]   but I want you to think back,
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:20.140]   what is something that you remember enjoying the most
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:24.020]   about cycle one with your kids?
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:29.060]   Well, one memory that I have is,
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.700]   I've actually heard this shared
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.780]   by other Classical Conversations families as well,
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.500]   but we had, I think the song has altered slightly,
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.380]   but we had a little song about the fall of Rome
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.900]   that it was caused by taxes and slavery
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.860]   and unemployment and diseases.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.820]   My kids, for whatever reason,
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.060]   they loved the melody of that song
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:54.540]   and they would, I would find them in the room giggling
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.220]   and then I would come in and they were singing that song
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.980]   and when it said contributed to the fall of Rome,
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.660]   they would plunge backward onto the bed.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.900]   And so they were literally falling.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.060]   That's hilarious.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.660]   I just have such fond memories of them singing that song
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.420]   and giggling that year.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.860]   Yes.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.820]   That was also the cycle where Abby often challenged me.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.580]   She wanted to make the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.860]   Oh my gosh.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.460]   Rice Krispie Treats for a presentation one day.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.060]   So we needed not just the Hanging Gardens of Babylon,
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.020]   but we needed an edible Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.420]   So I went along with that and we've made that.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.260]   That's a good one.
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.180]   You are a good mama.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.260]   You are a good mama.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.060]   That one pushed me.
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:42.060]   It is funny that our children come up with these wild things
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:48.020]   that we would never in a million years try to do.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:52.100]   But if our children are interested, we'll try it.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.380]   It's just amazing to me.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:58.020]   What do you think that your kids remember?
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.580]   Do you think Abby still remembers
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.140]   the edible Hanging Gardens?
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.220]   Oh, she definitely does.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:08.220]   That was a hallmark moment in our education.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.780]   But I also think that they will remember circling back
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.300]   to our open a book, open the world idea.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.780]   I had bought, I think at the homeschool convention,
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.780]   some books called "You Wouldn't Want to Live in."
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.220]   Oh, yes.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.180]   Some of them was "You Wouldn't Want to Live in Pompeii."
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:30.180]   That was, that tragedy was a compelling,
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.220]   fascinating story in our home.
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.100]   The idea that that entire town was buried.
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.140]   So I hope to take them there someday
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.580]   so that they can see it in person.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.420]   But that was one of them.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.420]   "You Wouldn't Have Wanted to Be a Roman Soldier."
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.700]   It was those kinds of books.
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.660]   Yes.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.820]   Just strange facts about living in the ancient world
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:51.020]   that we devoured and enjoyed during cycle.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:51.860]   It's so funny.
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.580]   I don't know if I would have remembered this at all
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.820]   if you hadn't said that.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.540]   But I think we must have read that same book,
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.580]   "You Wouldn't Have Wanted to Live in Pompeii."
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:03.460]   And I remember, especially my older daughter,
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.980]   being fascinated that it just kind of buried people that,
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.100]   she couldn't understand how, like,
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.340]   why didn't they run away?
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.700]   Or why couldn't they get away?
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.300]   And when she was little,
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:18.300]   that was just so weirdly fascinating to her.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.740]   And then we actually did get to see it.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.820]   The year that she graduated from Challenge Four,
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.500]   we had saved for years and took a trip to Europe
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.700]   and we did see Pompeii.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.700]   Oh, nice.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:36.700]   Yes, and it was a full circle moment, you know,
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.900]   from what you remembered
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:43.740]   and what you understood, even dimly as a child,
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:48.380]   to seeing those ruins in person.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.540]   That was really cool.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.180]   So yeah, yeah.
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:54.020]   Well, I appreciate you, Jennifer,
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.540]   taking a few minutes with us
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.580]   to talk about books and libraries and reading
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.260]   and then help us to think our way
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.420]   toward preparation for cycle one.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:06.900]   So thank you very much.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.340]   And we'll all show up at your house
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.900]   in the next couple of months
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.940]   to check out a book from your library, okay?
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.980]   I would love that.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.740]   Everyone, all are welcome.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.820]   That is so great.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.140]   And listen, parents,
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:24.500]   if a trip to Oklahoma is not in your future
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.420]   and you can't go visit Jennifer's library,
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.220]   there are lots of other ways for you to prepare yourself
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.540]   to be the lead learner in your home.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.860]   You can start building your own library
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.780]   using some of these titles that we've mentioned today.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.260]   That would be awesome.
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.500]   But if you're looking for something to do,
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.140]   maybe if you're looking for a community
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.260]   that could learn and grow along with you,
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.540]   you really are committed
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:54.500]   to becoming a better lead learner in your own home
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.980]   and learning how to lead your children
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.820]   to be ever more classical learners.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:06.820]   I'd love for you to check out the Classical Learning Cohort.
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:11.100]   We really believe that parents can learn
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:15.140]   to be better educators for their own children.
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:19.500]   Even when we all feel a little unsure about that goal,
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.260]   the Classical Learning Cohort program can really help.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.100]   This is what I would encourage you to do.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:30.100]   Go to classicalconversations/cohort
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:35.020]   and find out what the Classical Learning Cohort
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.420]   has to offer you and your family.
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.620]   Thanks for listening with us today.
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.980]   As Jennifer and I talk about our favorite subject books,
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.700]   and I wish you happy reading this summer.
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.340]   Thanks guys, and I'll see you next week.
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.000]   you
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
