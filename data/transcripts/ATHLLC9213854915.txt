[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.480]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.840]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.040]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.520]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have none other than
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.600]   Lee Rowan here for another episode.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.560]   Now, for those of you who don't know, Lee was my first guest on the podcast and he
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.240]   is one of the most knowledgeable people I know when it comes to travel hacking
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.000]   and really all things travel.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.120]   He currently runs a high-end travel company called Savanti, where he's
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.560]   helped clients plan incredible trips to every corner of the world.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.800]   He's also a travel hacker himself, and before Savanti, he
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.880]   was the COO of The Points Guy.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.280]   So why bring Lee back again?
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.960]   Well, if you listened to episode one, you wouldn't even doubt that decision.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.640]   But this time, Lee is going to give us a glimpse into the travel
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.560]   lifestyles of the rich and famous.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   Think private jets, luxury villas, and everything else.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.440]   But we're also going to talk about how you could hack some of these luxuries
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.200]   into your own life for a whole lot less.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.960]   This is a really fun episode with some great hacks, so I hope you enjoy it.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.080]   Let's jump in.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.040]   Lee, thank you for being here again.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.840]   First, second time guest.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.600]   I am incredibly honored to be here again.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.040]   I'm incredibly honored to be back here after you've already
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.160]   had a million downloads, 50 plus episodes.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.400]   You've interviewed Olympians, New York Times bestsellers, and somehow I'm here.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.040]   Yeah, just thank you.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.280]   First person I have on second, your episode has done the best of all time.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.120]   I think in part from Tim Ferriss' comparison to you and Hugh Jackman.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.560]   He put you on a pretty high pedestal.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.600]   That was incredibly humbling.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.720]   My wife is still trying to get me off that pedestal, but
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.920]   it's great to be up there.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.760]   Well, I got an email and it made me think, "I think we should get Lee back here."
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.400]   So I'm going to read it.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.880]   So Alberto sent an email in and said, "Hey, Chris, love your podcast.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.200]   And I'd love to hear more about ultra high-end travel experiences.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.720]   Even though not every listener can benefit from them, certainly many aspire
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.640]   to them, and all of them likely enjoy hearing about these possibilities.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.080]   So to me, that's what options do people have to fly private?
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.840]   How does that compare to first class?
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.720]   What premium programs aren't advertised that airlines and hotels offer?
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.760]   What kinds of experiences can a great concierge cover, et cetera?"
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.080]   So I can't think of anyone who knows that space better than you.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.320]   Well, you already heard in the intro, but this is what Lee does.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.840]   Like he plans these experiences.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.920]   So I thought that would be a fun conversation to have and
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.320]   worth having you back on again.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.800]   Awesome.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.520]   Well, thank you.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.120]   We can definitely dive into the travel lifestyles of the rich and famous, but
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.240]   I will caveat it by saying a couple of things.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.680]   Number one is that not all of these experiences are off limits
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.640]   to the not rich and famous.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.320]   I myself don't think that I can afford necessarily a private jet, but I've
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.480]   been lucky enough to fly private once or twice or have these incredible concierge
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.720]   experiences at hotels where if you just know the right angle, then you can really
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.920]   up your travel game, your travel experiences.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.160]   So definitely happy to talk about what people pay for and maybe some other great
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.280]   area of where you can kind of hack your way in.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.120]   Perfect.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.240]   The big question out there, something that I've never booked a private jet.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.880]   I've had the luxury of being invited to go on a flight
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.640]   from LA to San Francisco once.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.120]   It was quite the nice experience.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.360]   What does private jet travel look like?
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.120]   Is it incredibly expensive?
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.960]   Just kind of like set the standard for people on what is the
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.600]   experience and how much does it cost?
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.840]   If you had asked me this in our first meeting, almost a year ago, where we
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.360]   recorded the first podcast, I would have said private aviation is booming.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.760]   And I would have thought that we were at the very, very peak of the market.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.760]   Like the stock market, private aviations market has gone even higher since then.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.360]   So right now, private is very expensive and it's exclusive, right?
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.040]   You have your own jet to yourself, unless you're lucky enough to be invited on
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   somebody else's jet for a short hop somewhere, but because of that, and
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.000]   because of gas prices and just the demand on the market, it is incredibly expensive.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.160]   But the question is, how do you go about finding a, a jet, be a deal on a jet?
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.120]   And there are ways of doing that.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.720]   So there are search engines that are out there for jets.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.200]   Some people turn to brokers.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.960]   Some people in the travel industry have their own operator relationships where
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.240]   you can call up an operator and say, Hey, I'd like to charter a light jet or a
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.760]   midsize jet or a heavy jet, or one of those big business jets, because I've
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.800]   got to take X amount of people from San Francisco to New York, right?
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.480]   And then they get back to these quotes that are exceptional.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.520]   It used to be, you could take a super midsize jet nonstop across the country
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.080]   and it would be something like 25 or 30 grand one way.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.800]   And super midsize, how many people?
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.080]   Yeah, about nine people, give or take, right?
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.120]   Depends on the jet and the configuration of the seating.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.440]   Is there a lavatory seat, which is literally like somebody has to actually
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.680]   sit on top of a closed lavatory for takeoff and landing.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.640]   What does that look like?
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.600]   But generally nine people on a super mid coast to coast.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.560]   It used to be about 25 or 30 grand one way.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.240]   And now you're seeing that push up by 40, 45, sometimes 50 grand just
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.920]   to get coast to coast on a private jet.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.120]   So when I talked earlier about how the market is impacted and the prices have
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.880]   gone up, it's true, they've gone through the roof, but the dirty secret about
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.440]   private aviation is that not every flight is lined up with a buyer.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.080]   For instance, let's say they're taking a jet from the Bay area to the New York
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.680]   area, and now they've got to get that jet from New York down to
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.040]   Florida for the next client.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.600]   Well, it's going to fly empty.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.600]   And so the way to fly private for cheap, not for free, but for cheap to hack
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.320]   it is to find an empty leg that works for you.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.440]   Now operators of those private empty legs are savvy.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.920]   And so they're not going to let it go for free or even really for that cheap.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.480]   But instead of spending what would be 25, $30,000 on a one way flight,
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.120]   you might get it for five, seven, eight, 10.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.160]   And if you think about it, the cost of a commercial first-class seat might
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.920]   be a thousand or more dollars on that route.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.520]   So now if you have an empty leg that you can buy and you can fill it with eight
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.640]   or nine people paying a thousand bucks each, why you just paid for your empty leg.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.720]   So if you get very lucky, you know how to play the market, find the right sort of
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.240]   buys, and you can see those empty legs and fill them with people that you might
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.600]   know, then you can end up flying private for pretty cheap.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   Where does that end up happening on the busiest routes you'd suspect, right?
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.800]   I got to get a jet from the Bay area down to LA so it can fly.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.160]   It's going to go empty.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.400]   Let me try to fill it up.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.240]   It's always last minute, 72 hours or less out.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.560]   And sometimes you can get lucky and get a deal.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.800]   And is there a place online to look for these deals?
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   Oh boy, there's a bunch.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.520]   And we'll put some resources online later to show people where to look.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.920]   It's definitely a rabbit hole.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.720]   You got to go down and educate yourself on, but there are
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.640]   some empty leg listings online.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.080]   There are some operators that publish them online on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.440]   There are some of these membership groups that you can be a part of and you
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.360]   can pay to get access to empty legs.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.320]   They're just marketing a collection of lists that they've culled together.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.240]   But generally speaking, if you invest time and energy into learning a lot
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.600]   about how the market works and where to find these lists, you might be able
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.080]   to find yourself one or two deals a year that you could work on.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.120]   But at the end of the day, the deals we're talking about are flying
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.760]   private at the cost of commercial first class, if you can fill the plane.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.600]   If you can fill the plane.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.440]   It's all conditional.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.280]   It's never going to be, I want to go to LA.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.720]   Can I get a empty leg for 200 bucks?
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.080]   Or can I get a seat on a G450 that has to reposition?
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.520]   That just won't happen, right?
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.360]   So I think that's a really good example here, Chris, that
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.240]   you have to expectation set, right?
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.440]   You're not going to just fly private by using your points from your Chase Sapphire
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.120]   preferred and looking on a search engine online and it happens, right?
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.560]   It's a very calculated process that you have to get very lucky with a
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.520]   lot of stars lining to have happen.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.320]   And if you can do it great, it's an incredible experience.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.400]   Is it the best?
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.040]   And I'll be all of flying.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.200]   No, but it's pretty great if you can do it.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.160]   And just to kind of benchmark where you gave a couple examples, is there
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.000]   something that's like roughly for the most common type of plane dollars per hour.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.920]   So if someone listening is just thinking like, Hmm, what would it cost to fly
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.680]   to Cabo for the weekend or somewhere?
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.040]   Is there a benchmark?
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.240]   There used to be, and it used to be based on plane size.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.200]   You can get an approximate hourly rate, but there are so many variables to
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.920]   consider that it's so hard to say this is the ballpark cost, especially given a
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.520]   aviation fuel prices lately and be the impacting of the market of how much
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.800]   demand there is for private.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.920]   It's just insane.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.480]   So I wish I could say to you, Oh, heavy jet should be 10 grand an hour.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.960]   Uh, that would be great.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.400]   Sometimes you can get a heavy jet for eight grand an hour, and sometimes
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.320]   more often than not, it's 16 grand an hour.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.240]   So you just really can't ballpark it.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.120]   Well, I mean, you just did eight to $16,000 an hour.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.440]   Heavy jet seats up to 14 to 15, depending on the jet and depending
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.480]   on where you're going, right?
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.760]   Because you can't fly 14 people from LA to Europe nonstop, but you
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.800]   could maybe if you did it with eight.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.480]   Okay.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.840]   The kinds of experiences that you see people having people that are taking
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.720]   their family of four people on a private jet, it's probably a smaller plane.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.080]   Is that closer?
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.640]   I know you can't ballpark, but like $5,000 an hour, how wide is the swing?
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   That's the benchmark I've always been told is like, if you want a small
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.040]   plane, but it's not a prop plane, it's a jet, it's like 5,000 an hour.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.200]   So New York, 30 grand.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   Now I know you said, ah, things have gone up.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.520]   Maybe it's 15, 20, maybe it's six grand an hour or something like that.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.920]   But is that in the ballpark?
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.960]   It could be in the ballpark.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.800]   And it, again, depends on the jet itself, where you're going to and from.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.560]   Honestly, you know, flying West to East is a lot easier because you've got
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.280]   tailwinds and a jet can go a little further, but flying East to West and
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.200]   with a heavier load and a full load of people in the plane, it ends up
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.840]   being a lot more expensive, a lot longer time in that plane.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.600]   The other piece to keep in mind too, is what is that plane doing while you're there?
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.760]   Are you going a one-way or are you doing a round trip, right?
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.080]   If a plane is sitting and waiting for you, you're paying that operator to
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.560]   literally just have it sit there empty, underutilized, doing nothing.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.400]   If that plane is moving around and then popping back to pick you up later on,
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.160]   well, then maybe the operator can make some money on those other legs.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.080]   But if they're based out in California and you're flying them to New York, you
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.520]   better hope that they can get some business along the East coast by the
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.720]   time that they've got a return, otherwise you're just paying for that dead time.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.920]   When you cross borders, it's a whole different ball of wax.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.800]   There's this thing called cavitage that I love to talk about because it's so
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.760]   confusing and it's like an 1860s maritime law, but it basically says
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.600]   anytime you cross a border on one type of vessel, you have to cross that same
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.200]   border on the same type of vessel coming back and it's very confusing, but long
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.680]   story short, you can't fly down on one kind of private jet and come back on a
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.400]   different kind of private jet into and out of Mexico or Canada because the
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.720]   operator either won't take your business or the authorities there might get upset
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.360]   with you and charge you fines and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   So is a lot of private travel done domestically and internationally?
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.800]   It just is too far distance.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.960]   So it ends up being too expensive.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.880]   Are these rules or what's the most common use case for private travel?
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.400]   It honestly depends on the consumer.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.880]   It depends on what that client needs and what they're trying to accomplish, right?
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.320]   Some people have a very tight schedule and private allows them that freedom of
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.160]   having the time to do what they need to do in the order they want to do it.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.960]   For some people, it's about convenience.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.040]   They just want to show up at an FBO.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.400]   Don't have to worry about security.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.800]   Somebody else handles their bags and voila, they're off to the next place.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.600]   And it's just done like that for them.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.200]   For some people, it is about true luxury and they just don't want to
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.320]   have anything less than perfection.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.440]   And that's what private affords them.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:09.200]   There's no worrying about a commercial aircraft delay or a crew delay or whatever.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.360]   You're in control.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.000]   You say, I want to go 15 minutes later, an hour later, the plane waits for you.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.640]   It's not like you miss your Delta flight.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.400]   Cause you're like, I'll be there a little later, right?
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.120]   That would never happen.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.440]   So it really depends on who the person is and what their
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.120]   motivating factor of flying is.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.600]   But I can tell you that over the past six years of running this business, I have seen
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.840]   more private demand over the last 18 months than I would have ever imagined.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.280]   And I would probably just even say we've done more private aviation travel in the
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.280]   last 18 months than we did in the entire first five years of our business's existence.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.120]   And do you think that keeps up or do you think part of that, I assume, is because
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.960]   we had this pandemic where people didn't want to be around other people on an
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.320]   airplane, but maybe still wanted to travel.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:56.400]   Has it waned a little bit in the last few months as travels picked up and resumed?
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.280]   Not really.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.920]   I think what's been interesting is some of the trends in private aviation have
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   shifted to people who they used to maybe not fly private all the time.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:10.200]   And now they're only flying private and it's a easily accessible commercial
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.400]   route with a private-like experience.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:12.880]   I.e.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.320]   I can fly from San Francisco to JFK in a live flat seat in a cabin of 12 people.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:17.640]   Right.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.600]   Even though there's other cabins on that aircraft that have more people in them.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.200]   My first class cocoon feels like a private jet to me.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.960]   And then they'll do that over flying transcontinentally private.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.920]   Obviously people aren't electing to as much flight internationally, right?
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.760]   It's trans-oceanically in private jets, because that is so very expensive.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.640]   Flying from the East coast to Europe could easily run you 80 to a hundred
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.840]   grand one way, which is a lot of money.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.920]   And when you can get a very lovely first class experience on Lufthansa or Air
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.960]   France or Swiss for a 10th of that, it's a pretty easy mathematical equation there.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.080]   When we went to Bora Bora a couple of weeks ago, we landed on the tarmac in
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.840]   Bora Bora, tiny airport, like really small airport.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.880]   And we saw, I can't remember what it was.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.840]   I'm going to misquote it.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.320]   I think it was a Boeing business jet.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.360]   And I was like, wow, this person flew private.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.960]   Now the cool thing, if anyone ever sees a private jet, you could look at the tail
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.240]   number.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.360]   You could type it online and see where did this person come from?
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.000]   And I couldn't believe it.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.080]   So the person came from San Francisco and because the Bora Bora airport has no
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.320]   immigration, they also had to fly San Francisco to Papiete.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.720]   They had to get off the plane.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.360]   You could see that the plane sat there for an hour.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.000]   They must've gone through immigration, done their COVID testing, gotten back on,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.960]   flew that plane, the 30 minute route.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.000]   And all I could think about was they saved some time, right?
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.480]   We got to San Francisco an hour before our flight, hour 20 before our flight.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.480]   They might've gotten to San Francisco 30 minutes before their flight.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:44.880]   Right.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.600]   But in the grand scheme of things, it still took them almost 10 hours and maybe
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   they saved an hour, but I'm guessing people listening know that I did it on
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.320]   points, but I'm guessing that was not a $3,000 charter.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.000]   No, sir.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.840]   No, no.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.680]   That was a very substantial amount of money.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.040]   Those people spent for what I'm sure was an incredible trip for a private group.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.480]   Right?
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.400]   You don't think of somebody taking a BBJ for three people, right?
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.560]   It probably was a group of a dozen or 15 people on that plane, flying that route,
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   having a great time together.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.520]   And that is great.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.600]   If that can work out with their schedule and their economics, good for them.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.560]   But you and I are going to fly United.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.240]   And when you can fly United and find availability and last minute, especially,
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.240]   yeah, we booked it with Air Canada miles.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.000]   Cause it was less, we got, what I would argue is a very similar experience.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.640]   We had a lay flat bed, someone brought us food.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.280]   It wasn't exactly the same.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.560]   The plane left when the plane wanted to leave, didn't leave when we wanted to.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:46.000]   But for us, it was a points in $30 versus what I'm guessing was over six figures,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.880]   which well, well over six figures.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:48.840]   Good for them.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.960]   What's the experience like though?
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.360]   You've gotten to do it a few times.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.040]   Food, service, are there flight attendants?
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.840]   So paint a picture for what it's like from the moment you pull up, what happens?
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.000]   What's that experience like?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.240]   So let's start from the very, very top, right?
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.160]   You get a special address at a commercial airport that you're flying out of.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.720]   That is not the regular passenger terminal.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.600]   And that's called the FBO.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.840]   That's the area where all of the private planes fly out of.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.960]   It's usually on the opposite side of the airport from the passenger terminals.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.320]   So you pull up there and you literally walk into a building or sometimes they'll
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.840]   even drive you out directly onto the tarmac to meet your plane.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.720]   You drop your bags.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.840]   And from the moment you do that, someone else takes care of everything.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.960]   So the pilots will walk you through walking a visual inspection on the plane.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.080]   If you want to see it and take a look at what little parts of the plane do and
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.520]   educate you, you get on the plane and you can choose whatever seat you want.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.400]   Cause it's your plane.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.200]   So there's no assigned seating per se.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.200]   You asked about catering.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   You can pre-select what is sort of a standard stock of catering.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.400]   And that varies by operator, but generally speaking, there's waters and snacks and
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.120]   some bottles of wine, little bottles of booze and things like that.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.400]   But you can also augment that by bringing your own catering or working with the
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.040]   operator to have them cater the vessel for you.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.800]   Thing to note about catering is that if you think getting a private jet is
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.600]   expensive, you have not seen a $65 club sandwich yet because it's unreal what
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   those catering bills are.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.200]   We'll see catering bills sometimes in the multiple thousands for not that fancy of
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:14.520]   a meal.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.280]   Wow.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.720]   Yeah, it's pretty exceptional.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.480]   So I always love just recommending people to bring Uber Eats or bring food from
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.200]   home that you love.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.880]   Though I guess if you're spending a hundred thousand dollars on a flight,
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.800]   it's a rounding error, but even I guess people that fly private want a little
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.040]   hack to save money on food.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.560]   I always recommend that there are flight attendants on some of these flights,
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.480]   especially on the heavy jets and ultra long range jets, generally speaking, you
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.360]   know, not something that I see on a lot of like midsize or smaller jets because
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.880]   there's really no need, especially because those jets have a unlimited mission
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.200]   size.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.000]   They're going on a four or five hour trip.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.520]   Maybe at most you don't really need service during that time.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.280]   One of the things I find so interesting about flying private is that generally
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.040]   the cockpit doors open at any kind of point in the flight.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.920]   You can stroll on in and be like, how are we doing folks?
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.840]   Sit down at a jump seat and kind of take a look at the instrumentation and see how
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.680]   the plane is flown.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.920]   And that to me is the, it's probably one of the coolest parts of flying private is
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.840]   that you're with the crew.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   They get to know you.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.640]   You get to know them.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.320]   I've had crew write thank you notes to passengers of mine because they've
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.520]   developed friendships on these short flights.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.840]   And that's really lovely because you get to feel like you're part of the
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.560]   operation if you choose to do so.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.920]   If you want privacy and you want to be locked back in your cabin, no problem.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.800]   You can do that too.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.320]   And then when you land, what does that look like?
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.000]   Like, do you just get off the plane and leave?
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.760]   Do you go through the airport?
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.680]   We didn't mention before you board, is there security?
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.880]   What is the kind of ins and outs of getting on the plane?
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.840]   Yeah, generally there's no security, but depending on the flight and where
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.880]   you're going, if it's transborder, there'll be a little bit of a document
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.080]   check and the passengers will have to make sure that the manifest matches what
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.000]   their IDs are.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.200]   And the pilots will usually do that, but generally there's no security
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.160]   of anything to speak of.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.280]   When you land, this is kind of the best part is you just stroll off the plane.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.520]   I happened to get very lucky and get an empty leg to go to Bozeman, Montana,
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.000]   and I brought my daughter along with me.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.640]   And when we got off the plane, our rental car was right there, plain side.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.280]   And what I mean right there, plain side, I mean like maybe three
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.480]   feet from the stairs.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.040]   We just strolled in through our backpacks in the trunk and drove away.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.760]   It was the coolest experience to be driving on the tarmac next to your plane
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.240]   is just like unreal.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.960]   So convenience, ease.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.280]   Sure.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.160]   It makes total sense.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:25.880]   Price.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.360]   I mean, it makes sense for everybody.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.680]   I wouldn't even know if I can call this a hack, but there's an airline, you
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.280]   know, they don't fly all over the country called JSX.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.760]   The best.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   And for maybe like two X, the cost of economy is not even as expensive as
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.480]   first-class domestically.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.000]   You can fly JSX.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.760]   They fly, you would know better than me.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.720]   What types of planes?
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.680]   Yeah, they're ERJs.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.840]   They're a little regional, regional jets made by Embraer.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.960]   They're 30 seats.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.560]   So the window seat, A by itself.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.640]   And then there's B and C sitting together, 10 rows.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.200]   And they're exceptional for the value, for the fact that you do pull up to an
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.480]   FBO again, across the airport at Oakland or Las Vegas or Burbank or wherever
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.480]   you're flying, you're not at the regular passenger terminal and you go through a
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.760]   light security check there.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.600]   They check your ID.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.840]   They sort of wand your bag and make sure that there's nothing funky there.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.960]   And then that's it.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.840]   You fly on this plane, you land, and it's the same process.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.520]   When you get to Las Vegas, you walk right through the terminal and you're right
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.840]   outside and there's a taxi cab waiting for you.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.360]   And by terminal, Lee means like literally a small building.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.240]   Like an office.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:36.080]   Like I would say out the door to the Uber or Lyft you call is measured maybe in
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.880]   seconds or maybe one or two minutes.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.680]   Maybe 30 seconds.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.720]   If you stop to pee, it's a minute.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   It's really not that, yeah.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.280]   So that is an exceptional experience.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.880]   And for the dollar value of that, it's great.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.960]   You don't have to worry about being in a crowded terminal, getting there an hour
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.600]   and a half early, all that nonsense.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.680]   So I'd say you don't get the plane to yourself.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.440]   The plane leaves when it wants to leave.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.520]   It's still on a schedule.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.720]   But if you want to experience what it's like to go to the FBO terminal to get on,
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.120]   to walk off the plane, and you just want to do that for, I'd say probably 2x the
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.080]   cost of a normal economy flight, you know, you could do that with JSX.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:14.200]   It seems like with every business you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.600]   emerge, things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.800]   many manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.880]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.040]   37,000, 25, 1.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.440]   37,000.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.960]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.360]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.880]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.200]   management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.600]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.880]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days,
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.160]   not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.560]   And one, because your business is one of a kind, so you get a customized solution
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.200]   for all your KPIs in one efficient system with one source of truth.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.120]   Manage risk, get reliable forecasts, and improve margins.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.480]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.280]   companies I've run, makes everything so much better.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.560]   So right now, download NetSuite's popular KPI checklist, designed to give you

[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.680]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.960]   actually so good for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.840]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:57.920]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:03.360]   250-year-old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.720]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals,
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.480]   and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.640]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep, because they're all in pre-measured
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:20.960]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds, and are so travel friendly.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.200]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.920]   Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:35.080]   digestion and metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good, and probably
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.720]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.320]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.600]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.040]   and then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.880]   than all other teas in the world.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.840]   But you don't even have to take my word, or do any research, because Peak offers
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.240]   free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:03.040]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:10.560]   samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E, so check them out today
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.720]   at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.280]   So when people who would otherwise fly private are flying commercially, I know
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.520]   there's actually some experiences you can have at the airport, changing planes when
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:30.160]   you land, that maybe we've casually seen as normal travelers, someone holding a
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.400]   sign or something at the airport.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.360]   What are those experiences like?
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.040]   Talk a little bit about first-class terminals and greeters.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.760]   Yeah, there's two levels of this experience.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:44.960]   One is sort of accessible to all, and the other is less accessible to all.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.080]   So the greeters, those people who are holding the placards when you land and who
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.960]   are not associated maybe with a wheelchair, right, are there waiting for a VIP.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.120]   They're people who are greeting you at the jet bridge of your aircraft when you
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.000]   arrive, and they're going to be the ones bringing you through all the formalities
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.640]   that follow.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.840]   So let's say you fly from Dallas to Paris and you land in Paris, and there is
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.080]   somebody standing at the gate with a sign saying Hutchins, you and Amy get off and
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.880]   you go with that person, and they then take you through the following steps.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.200]   They'll take you through customs and immigration through a fast line, whether
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.120]   that's a diplomatic line or a not crowded line or whatever it is, it's a line where
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.600]   you don't have to wait in line, which is great.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.520]   They'll then help you expedite and grab your bags, and then they'll bring you
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.000]   onwards to the next experience that's waiting for you.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.120]   If that's a connecting flight, they'll help you recheck, go through security
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.680]   again, get on that flight.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   If it's a ground transfer, they'll know exactly where your ground transfer is,
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.880]   and they'll walk you out to that, making sure of course to stop you at a bathroom
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.600]   or an ATM or a croissant stand or whatever it is you might need.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:49.080]   And that service is actually surprisingly affordable, and in my opinion, one of the
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:55.000]   most underutilized and highly valuable options that a family can use when going
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.320]   to Europe, especially in the summer, it could be $300 for a family of four to
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.600]   have a VIP arrival experience, highly recommended.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.760]   At certain airports, you can also do that on the departure side, not usually in the
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:11.880]   States, but you could, but especially overseas and in a crowded place like Rome
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.120]   in the summer, highly recommend that as well.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.640]   I know in the US, for example, if you fly to SFO and you happen to be United's
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.360]   invite-only status, global services, there's actually a separate room and you
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.800]   just go in this room and they check you in, they take your bags, and then they
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.000]   actually just like put you at the front of the security line.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.400]   Right.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.680]   Is that something that you can, instead of having to spend tens of thousands of
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.520]   dollars on United, you could just pay for and kind of have a similar experience?
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.680]   Domestically, it's a little harder because of our democratic notions here in the
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.760]   States that it's hard to buy sort of elite access to things.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.240]   There are ways of doing it in some airports, but generally speaking,
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.040]   domestically, especially on arrival, but even on departure, it's very hard to get
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:53.840]   to the front of the line.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.080]   Overseas, it's a whole different ball of wax.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:01.240]   So you want to spend a certain amount of money in any foreign airport.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   There's a greeter service for arrivals and departures that will allow you to
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.640]   basically cut the line, get to the best lounge, and then have somebody walk you
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.920]   from that lounge to the plane when you want.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Are you going to board first?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.800]   Are you going to board last?
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.440]   This is always a choice they give you, right?
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.440]   So that greeter and lounge experience is generally available for purchase
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:17.920]   everywhere.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.160]   Now you mentioned also earlier lounges.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.240]   What are those exceptional lounge experiences that people can have access
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.640]   to here in the States?
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.600]   We've got one out of LAX called PS the private suite, which is pretty
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.160]   exceptional.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.520]   It's on the opposite side of the airport from the passenger terminal.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.880]   It's on the South side and it is a two part place.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.040]   One is a salon where it's open to a smaller group of the public.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.680]   And the other is a private suite, which is just open to you.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.720]   Prices are pretty steep.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.360]   They start in the five hundreds and go to five thousands per use per person.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.520]   So it can get a little crazy, but the experience is unparalleled.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.000]   You check in there, you do security there.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.520]   They drive you to the foot of your plane, to the gate, to get you boarding,
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.520]   whether it's again, first or last on your plane directly from this suite.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.480]   So you don't have to see the airport at all.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.760]   You check your bags there, you do customs there.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.920]   When you arrive there, like it's seamless and easy and beautiful.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.600]   So if you're flying into or out of, or even via LAX, it can make sense
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.120]   depending on the party and the cost and what you're trying to do.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.000]   But mostly in the U S we can rely on our TSA pre, we can rely on clear and
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.880]   we can kind of make the airport pretty smooth.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.440]   Chances are most people listening and have a card with priority pass.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.920]   You can go to a lounge internationally.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.800]   And I would say sometimes if you're flying internationally in business class
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.520]   and a lot of the Middle Eastern airlines, they include this.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:43.000]   So we went to Qatar once and it included this greeter experience.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.440]   And it was like, let's skip the whole line here.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.400]   When you come back, let's skip the whole line.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.080]   And I was like, wow, that was fancy.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.240]   And then I looked it up and I think it was, I could be really wrong here,
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.920]   but it was like $80.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:59.160]   It was not like $5,000, definitely worth looking up traveling overseas.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.120]   And LAX sounds, I can't come up with an experience where I would want to spend
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.480]   $500 to get to the airport and have it easier.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.840]   But you know, that's for someone.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.720]   That is for someone.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.200]   And there are some domestic airfare deals where that's actually bundled in.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.440]   So you can take a look, you know, United has a deal.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.280]   American has a deal with PS at LAX on certain flights.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.320]   So if you happen to be transiting LAX in the next couple of months or years, it's
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.040]   worth taking a look at it to see if it makes sense for you.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:24.600]   All right.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.800]   So I think we covered a lot on flights.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.560]   I'm going to ask a question that has nothing to do with super high end.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.760]   But I was flying back from Bora Bora on United and I think this was the first
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.680]   time I ever noticed this new cabin.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.120]   I think they call it premium plus.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.840]   And I feel like for a long time there was premium economy and then it was gone.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.160]   And then all the airlines domestically started adding economy plus and comfort
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.560]   plus, which was basically coach with a little more leg room and maybe some extra
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.120]   snacks.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:52.520]   Right.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.120]   And I saw premium plus and the flight was empty.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.480]   There was one person in all, maybe 30 seats, but it looked pretty nice.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:06.600]   Is premium economy coming back and for people trying to really maximize dollars
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.080]   or miles, is it a pretty viable option?
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.360]   How does it compare to business or first?
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.560]   This is a great question.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:18.160]   So premium economy is a thing and it is also a super confusing thing because
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.280]   airlines have done a terrible job of distinguishing what is an actual premium
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:28.240]   economy cabin versus what's a premium economy seat.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   For example, on United there is economy plus, which they used to call their
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.800]   premium economy seat until they actually put in a premium economy cabin premium
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.360]   plus so confusing.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.000]   It just, it doesn't make any sense as a consumer.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.480]   When you're looking at it, you're like, where am I sitting?
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:45.880]   What am I saying?
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.560]   What am I paying for?
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.680]   How do I upgrade into this?
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.200]   It's just too much.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.640]   So I like to think of it this way.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.240]   Whenever you're flying internationally, ideally transoceanically, there is going
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.080]   to be a premium economy cabin, a separate cabin with fancier seats.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.320]   They're not lie flat.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.080]   It's not a business class, but it might feel like a domestic business
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.800]   class on a lazy boy kind of seat, right?
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.360]   You've got a little more recline, a little more leg room on the United flights.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.760]   It's usually a two, three, two seating, whereas an economy in the back, it's
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.560]   three, four, three, or three, three, three, very crowded.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.480]   You feel more spacious up there.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.920]   There's a better premium version of food.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.400]   You earn more miles for those seats, et cetera.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.640]   So there is a separate cabin for that.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.080]   Again, it's not going to be seen outside of a couple of domestic routes where
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.440]   they're flying those bigger craft to reposition them.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.080]   It's not going to be seen domestically.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:40.160]   Now, confusingly, they will market domestically sometimes their economy
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.520]   plus seating as premium economy.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.440]   Delta is notorious for this.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:48.560]   When you fly from JFK to San Francisco, they will market what they call Delta
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.720]   comfort, which is their economy plus as a premium economy cabin.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.920]   It's not, it's still just an economy seat with a little bit extra legroom.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.920]   So we're talking literally about two very separate cabins,
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.000]   very separate experiences.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.880]   As of right now, the airlines haven't really figured out how to optimize
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.680]   their mileage game when it comes to redemption for those premium plus
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.200]   the actual cabin premium economy seats.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.880]   So what I would always recommend is looking to upgrade into them, book
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.000]   an economy ticket and see what the mileage upgrade cost would be to
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.120]   actually upgrade into that premium cabin.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.320]   It's often fairly affordable.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.640]   United sometimes charges 10 or 20 plus points per leg.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.240]   If you have those plus points, whereas other airlines, the
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.520]   price differential is so high.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.240]   It's almost like a mid tier between economy and business class when you pay
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.480]   for it, but when you actually use mileage to upgrade, it's not that expensive.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.360]   Okay.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.480]   And one thing we didn't mention for anyone using miles to travel internationally,
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.120]   a important thing to remember.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.400]   If you've never flown business class internationally, then there are
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.000]   two things that are interesting.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.280]   One, the trans-oceanic flight is going to be a next level experience.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.640]   I almost say, make sure that you have enough points to do it again.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.880]   Cause if you just do it once, you're going to want to do it every time.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.320]   The small short routes are awful.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.040]   They're terrible.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.520]   Intra-European business class is not business class.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.600]   When we went to Greece last year, we were like, Oh, we found seats.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.000]   It was business class the whole way.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.000]   And we were on Air France and from San Francisco to Paris, lie
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.320]   flat bed, wonderful service.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.400]   We get on the flight from Paris to Crete in Greece.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.680]   It's basically the first two rows of an economy flight with the exact same
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.400]   seats and they block off the middle seat.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.840]   And I would say if you're trying to move around Europe and you want to feel fancy,
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:39.120]   unless you're sure the plane you're on is a real business class plane, I would not
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:44.840]   ever use your miles to fly business class, intra-Europe, maybe even intra-Asia.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.720]   I'm not sure if it's the same there, but definitely intra-Europe.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.480]   Absolutely.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.800]   And it's always useful to check whenever you're doing those shorter
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.480]   hops, what airline is operating the flight?
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.360]   What aircraft are they actually operating that flight on?
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.840]   And what do the seat maps look like?
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.160]   Because if you're flying from Tokyo to Sapporo in Japan, that's hour and a half
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.640]   flight, they're actually going to put a triple seven with lie flat seats on that
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.200]   domestic small hop.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.480]   And it's a great experience, right?
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.040]   And you can use lounges and it's wonderful.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.640]   In Europe, it's the opposite.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.600]   You could fly three hours and it could be in a little crappy 737 and they're giving
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.640]   you like a hot piece of pizza for lunch.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.360]   It's sad.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.280]   So make sure you're using your miles and points correctly.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.360]   And then Seat Guru, great site.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.840]   You can go look at all the seat maps.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.000]   They usually say, yeah, this is just a regular seat with the middle seat blocked
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.320]   off.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.560]   So that's flights.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.920]   We hit a lot of stuff.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.640]   I want to talk about hotels because I feel like there's a lot more mystery here a
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.120]   little bit.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.920]   Everyone knows first class, they walk by it on the plane, but you don't always walk
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.360]   through the high end resorts.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.560]   In my opinion, it's a little harder.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.760]   It's not here are the business class flights.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.840]   Here are the coach flights.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.720]   There's a giant spectrum of resorts and hotels.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.920]   And I used to think five star was the top.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.320]   And then that hotel in Dubai started saying, no, no, no.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.160]   We are a seven star hotel.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:58.800]   What does that even mean?
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.400]   What is the high end of luxury hotels look like?
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.760]   And maybe just to start, what sets apart whatever category you call them, whether
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:10.240]   you call them five star or just high end, like what sets them apart from all the
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:10.960]   other hotels?
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.960]   Well, there's a couple of things that set them apart, right?
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.240]   One from the very face of it is price, right?
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.120]   What can you charge and get away with charging for that room?
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.760]   And what we've seen very much like we've seen in the private aviation sector is
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.640]   that on the hotel side, rates have gone through the roof over the last two years.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:33.240]   And especially on the higher end of the five star properties, it's incredible what
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.120]   some of these properties are charging, which then begs the question, is it worth
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:36.320]   it?
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.560]   So that comes to point number two, which is distinguishing factor of service, right?
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:46.640]   Are you getting the service level that five star or that price tag demands?
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.960]   That is an issue right now.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.320]   And I will say globally service for hotels has been troublesome.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.840]   We had a client recently in the Middle East at one of those five or seven star
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.400]   hotels, and we couldn't get ahold of the concierge for almost a day.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:06.120]   That's unacceptable for a global brand where somebody spending thousands of
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:11.680]   dollars a night for a room, price, service, location, all distinguish in when you
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.080]   create this five star atmosphere.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.440]   But the fourth thing is what are the amenities that are on the offer at that
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.680]   hotel that make them truly stand out?
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.560]   A minute ago, we talked about VIP access at airports.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.080]   A lot of the Parisian five-star hotels will actually, as part of the amenities
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.720]   that you get when you book with them, they'll actually bundle in an arrival
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.480]   greeter that will pick you up plain side and bring you through customs immigration
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.320]   to one of their cars waiting for you to whisk you to the hotel.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.840]   And it's a seamless experience.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:43.400]   So that's why when we talked on our first chat, we chatted about how important it
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.160]   is to let the hotel know your travel plans, who you are, what you're coming to
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:51.600]   do, what experiences you want to have, your arrival and departure details, right?
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.040]   Because they're actually going to customize as part of their package that
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.000]   they're selling you, your arrival and departure with them.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   That's incredible.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.400]   So a five-star hotel, in my opinion, provides exceptional service at an
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.960]   attractive price, and I want to say affordable because that's out the window
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:13.320]   now, and they do it at a great location where the amenities are so rich and
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.320]   wonderful that make them stand out from the rest of their competitors in that
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:23.440]   field, sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and trade.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.440]   Coffee is a great addition to your new year routine.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.000]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.760]   Trade is a subscription service.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.880]   We've been using for over a year that sources the best coffee across the
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.560]   country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.720]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.000]   So you can enjoy their craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.880]   of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.840]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade, sign up for a
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:55.560]   subscription or try one of their starter packs today, it's been so convenient for
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.520]   us to have coffee, just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:03.000]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade, but this
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.480]   last bag of beans from drink coffee, do stuff in Tahoe, it's called bark
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   the moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.000]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   Right now, trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:23.840]   When you visit all thehacks.com/trade that's all thehacks.com/trade for a
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.680]   free bag with select subscription plans, all thehacks.com/trade.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:34.800]   Do you all remember episode one 22, when I spoke to chef David Chang
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.720]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.200]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.600]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.880]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.960]   microwave cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.400]   to partner with them for this episode.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.560]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.160]   from scratch in the microwave.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:02.520]   And honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.000]   up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.040]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.720]   store, and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.520]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.240]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.760]   highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.200]   It is so good.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.640]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.760]   last year, you have to check it out.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:36.480]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.920]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:47.000]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.840]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:54.720]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts from our partners, you
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.840]   can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.240]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.880]   So let's get a little bit more tangible.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.040]   If we're going to look at two properties anywhere, let's say
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.320]   resorts in Mexico, four and five star, it might be three or four times
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.200]   more to stay at the higher end resort.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.320]   What does that get you?
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.680]   That's a great question.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.200]   And hopefully the Delta is not three or four times between a four and a five
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.360]   star, but sometimes it is.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.920]   I would say that at a five star, you're looking at a less crowded restaurants
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.800]   and you're looking at maybe a larger room, a more responsive concierge.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:32.120]   There might be more onsite amenities, more pools, an adult only pool perhaps,
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   or a family pool or something else that sets them apart amenity wise.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.560]   You might be looking at more personalized service.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:42.360]   Do you have a Butler or do you have a team of concierges that are attached to
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.000]   your type of villa product or your room product?
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.600]   Now, going back to my comment earlier, unfortunately, service has been an issue.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.480]   Four and five star properties globally lately.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:56.120]   So you may stay at a five star and you might be really excited about the
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.960]   splurge, this bucket list experience.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.080]   We've put all of our points into this stay, and you might
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.320]   be underwhelmed by service.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.280]   That's not necessarily a reflection accurately of the star rating right now.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.720]   It's a reflection of the global atmosphere for service.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.120]   And hopefully we're going to get out of that this year, but it's
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.160]   been a little interesting out there.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.560]   So again, coming back to my initial point, the more you can share with a
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.240]   hotel ahead of time, especially a five star hotel to allow them to really
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.200]   customize that experience for you, they'll knock it out of the park
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.160]   with the data that you give them.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:26.920]   Cool.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.920]   I've learned recently.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.560]   So when we were going to Bora Bora, I was like, okay, to me, the
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.600]   Conrad, the St.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.560]   Regis, the Four Seasons, those are the kind of high end
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.080]   resorts, the nicest things.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.440]   I've recently learned that there is even a tier above that, that
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   I didn't know a lot about.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:47.000]   In French Polynesia, the hotel I'd put there, I learned about was the Brando.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.280]   It's much more expensive.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.440]   I would say it definitely is three or four times the price.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:56.040]   And then I've learned that there's a whole chain of Amman resorts and they
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.600]   are similarly much, much more expensive.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.840]   And so what do you call them?
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.000]   There has to be some way to differentiate a five star St.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.120]   Regis, Ritz Carlton, Conrad from an Amman or the Brando, or I'm sure
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.480]   there's other examples you have.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.320]   It's a great question.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.720]   I mean, they're all are still five star, but there are these ultra luxury
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.440]   resorts that have their own sort of special categorization that are
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.400]   unique, singular destinations.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.800]   The Brando is a great example.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.720]   For those who don't know the Brando is its own private Island owned by the
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.520]   Brando family as in Marlon Brando.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.040]   It's right North of Papeete in Tahiti.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.600]   And what sets it apart is that it's an eco resort, but it's super luxe.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:41.240]   So, you know, you would go traditionally to a normal five star over the water
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.640]   bungalow experience, like the St.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.880]   Regis and Bora Bora and have that perfect Instagram photo sort of vacation.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.320]   The Brando is a little more experiential.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.840]   There's no over water bungalows.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:55.680]   It's more villas on a private beach, but very secluded and very customized to you.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.600]   So again, back to my point earlier, you bring this super long questionnaire to
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.440]   the Brando where they ask you all your likes and dislikes, even down to which
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.400]   alcohol brands do you like, because they want to make sure that in your all
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.040]   inclusive mini bar, they've stocked that.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.040]   I said to them, for instance, I love champagne.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:10.760]   My wife doesn't.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.240]   So they put instead of full bottles of champagne, half bottles.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.800]   And that was a really nice touch because they knew that my wife wasn't going to be
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.480]   drinking and I didn't want to get knockered off of one bottle, full bottle of
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.320]   champagne, that level of attention to detail sets them apart.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.040]   The level of amenities they offer sets them apart.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.960]   And when you look at a mons or Rosewoods or some of these other ultra high end
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.680]   luxury properties around the world, there are singular destinations that
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.600]   are a truly a sense of place.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:41.720]   It's not just an over water experience with a pretty backdrop, but it's the
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:46.280]   essence of that property or of that destination that sets that hotel apart.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:50.800]   It's villas built into a cliff side or it's villas built over in an eco
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.840]   friendly manner over a mangrove reef.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.240]   And you're like, wow, this is incredible.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.440]   And there's no place in the world I could stay like this.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:01.400]   And it comes with a price tag, of course, and it comes with incredible amenities
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.040]   that you won't get elsewhere because of what is offered there.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.640]   So it's a truly once, I don't know, lifetime for some people, but once
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.800]   ever experience for most of us.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:16.320]   For me, I've been in an Amman resort, but I have not stayed in an Amman resort.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.320]   I also noticed something.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.560]   None of these have loyalty programs.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.240]   You don't earn points.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.680]   You don't redeem with points.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.560]   Do people that have a lot of money that stay at really high end
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.240]   properties, is that not a factor?
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.080]   Why are there no loyalty programs?
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.920]   I'm mostly speaking because I wish that there were these experiences.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.960]   I mean, they are so aspirational for those of us who aren't necessarily
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.920]   dropping $5,000 a night on a hotel room.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.240]   I would say this, there are loyalty programs there.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.040]   You just don't know about them.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.560]   The Mandarin Oriental, one of my favorite hotel chains in the entire world.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.480]   They only have two dozen properties globally and they're exceptional
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.920]   in every single location.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.640]   They know everything they need to know about you, which is one of the
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.880]   purposes of a loyalty program.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:46:00.160]   But yeah, you don't have points on a Mandarin card, but they do know when
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:04.440]   you ordered a drink at the Bangkok bar and then you go to London two weeks
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.680]   later, they're like, Oh, Mr.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.160]   Hutchins, would you like that same drink with the Bombay Sapphire?
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:13.760]   And that is like skin crawlingly amazing for like the data to work that way, to
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.480]   make your experience so customized and wonderful.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:21.120]   An example on that, in fact, not to do with loyalty, but to do with data is I
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.960]   stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.760]   And at the time I had an 18 month old child, he needed milk in the middle of
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.640]   the night and he needed to stretch his legs and he was just antsy.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.280]   So I took him out of the room.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.520]   My butler saw that my door was open and said, Mr.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.600]   Rowan, how do we help you?
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.120]   And I said, we're good.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.840]   Thank you so much.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.240]   We're just going to go out and stretch our legs and go get some milk.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.640]   We're going to leave the property.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.520]   It's one 30 in the morning.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.000]   They're like, Oh sir, we've got milk here.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.320]   And I was like, it's not the milk.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.080]   He just needs to like stretch his wings.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:53.320]   So there were 11 people that helped me between my room, the elevator, the
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.320]   lobby, the front desk, and leaving that room.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.520]   And when I came back, they're like, Oh, did you get milk?
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.480]   Is there anything else you need?
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.280]   How do we help you?
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.360]   When I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in London years later, they said, Oh, we
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.000]   remember a story about you getting milk, Jeremy.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.160]   And I'm like blown away that years later they would connect the dots.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.440]   So that builds loyalty in me for sure.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.520]   I will talk about that story all the time.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.120]   And I will say the Mandarin Oriental knows how to deal with data and knows
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.320]   how to take care of people and knows how to show what it truly means to be a guest.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.880]   Do I earn points every time I stay there?
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.640]   Yeah, I use the right credit card, but I don't earn a loyalty
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.120]   program points with them.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.880]   And that's the kind of loyalty they're trying to build.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.480]   I've had a glimpse of some of that in four seasons.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.840]   We were fortunate to stay at the Four Seasons in Bali.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:40.280]   And every morning they remembered, I love jackfruit for anyone
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.400]   who's never had a jackfruit.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.880]   I describe it as if a banana and a pineapple created a fruit child.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.040]   Very weird looking fruit child.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.400]   A very weird looking fruit child.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.760]   And do not mistake for a durian because very different fruit.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:55.000]   And every morning they were like, Oh, do you want some jackfruit?
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.600]   I know it's not in the regular fruit tray, but even if it was a different
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.320]   waiter, we knew you had it yesterday morning, you asked for it, but I've
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.480]   never gotten to that next crazy level.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.160]   So here's an interesting, different version of that.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.840]   The Four Seasons also has this thing called the glitch report where every
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.600]   day, if there was an issue, let's say your toilet didn't flush.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.000]   Okay.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.120]   Everyone in the resort would know that you had an issue and that they are
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.640]   singularly focused on fixing that problem.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.440]   It doesn't mean that the housekeeper is going to be in your like room
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.960]   the whole day fixing your toilet.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.560]   It just means that the pool attendant might be like, Hey, Mr.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.000]   Hutchins, is there anything we can get for you?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:28.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.360]   You had a rough night last night.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.320]   That's incredible, right?
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.400]   That builds loyalty in a way that points and miles maybe won't ever.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.200]   Because when was the last time that Delta really thank you for
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.040]   your business, Mr.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.520]   Hutchins, they're just reading off a sheet.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.600]   They don't know that you just came from Cleveland and you're tired.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   You know, they don't know any of that.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:47.360]   So that level of loyalty is something that all hotels should aspire to.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:47.840]   In my opinion.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.760]   I look forward to a successful life that affords more of them.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.840]   Or for people listening, they might not know that because Lee works in the
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:01.320]   industry, I think one of the perks that you're afforded is because you make a
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.800]   lot of recommendations to clients.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.640]   Hotels often give you a good deal.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.280]   If anyone listening is wondering how to hack it, the other options
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.360]   to just work in the industry.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.320]   Come join our industry.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.200]   We need good people and trust me, we're always hiring.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.280]   A lot of people I know love to stay at Airbnbs.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:16.920]   I'm not saying there aren't high-end luxury properties on Airbnb.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.000]   There definitely are.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:25.080]   But is there another level of the villa or home rental market that someone like
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.400]   me or anyone listening just has never heard of?
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.200]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:33.920]   So I like to use VRBO and Airbnb as a really good search engine barometer of
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.280]   where I should be putting people in homes in certain areas, because it tends to
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:41.080]   give me some good feedback on a market that I may not know.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.960]   The downside is that the quality level stops at that maybe four, four and a
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   half star tier property and just get stuck there.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:51.560]   And if you've got a client with seven star expectations and the need for
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.720]   something a little larger, bigger, whatever, then you got to turn elsewhere.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.760]   So there are a number of higher end search tools that we can use to source
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.440]   homes and villas, just like the ones you're mentioning, right?
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.240]   These super high-end luxury villa properties that have multiple bedrooms,
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.280]   incredible kitchens, staff, all of that stuff.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.120]   Over time, you kind of understand who the players are in each market.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.840]   And it really is hyper-regionalized.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:19.120]   There is a Mexico player that has great villas all throughout Mexico, but then
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:22.120]   there was one in Punta Mita that I would use specifically when I'm traveling
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.720]   there and looking for properties there.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.440]   What are you expecting out of these places?
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.520]   Number one, you're going to be signing a contract that signs your life away.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:32.560]   You're going to be wiring money to some bank account somewhere as a deposit, and
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.840]   then 30 or 60 days out wiring the rest.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.080]   There's big, hefty security deposits.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.440]   I just saw for the first time ever, a quarter million dollar security deposit
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.760]   on a villa that we're renting for someone.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.360]   And my eyes, I'm sorry, what?
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.680]   Not 25,000?
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.120]   So you're looking at big contracts, big security deposits, but they come
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.520]   with these incredible amenities.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.720]   Some of these houses that we've rented for people come with a staff of 30.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.320]   You know, you have your own Michelin starred chef that will
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.520]   cook you whatever you want.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.760]   And again, pre-ordering and telling them the details ahead of time.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.000]   This person's vegetarian, they only eat fish, undercook the beef for him.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.560]   That's super important because they're going to customize
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.760]   that experience to that stay.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.920]   But they're just what you would expect from those TV shows, The
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.560]   Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous or Cribs.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.680]   They're just these over the top homes that have the best view of Aspen, or
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:21.160]   you have the most incredible private beach in Malibu, or you've got your own
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.840]   nine acres of riverfront property in Montana where you can catch your own
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.080]   fish, just incredible properties like that.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.720]   If someone listening is like, I just want to go look at a few pictures.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.520]   It doesn't have to be a site that covers everything, but is
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.480]   there a place that just has a few of these that you can go look at?
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   One I like the most for domestic properties is called Cuvee, C-U-V-E-E.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.360]   They're based out of Colorado.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.720]   They've got beautiful properties.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.040]   And some of those, including the one in Aspen I mentioned, anybody can book these.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.680]   You don't need to have a special in or connection, but they're incredible.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:52.600]   They're vacation homes of a lifetime and they can actually make sense economically.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.720]   If you have a big enough group and you're looking for something that's
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:59.520]   a bucket list experience, it's not always much more than getting
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.800]   rooms or suites at a hotel.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.280]   There's a house, feel free to Google it.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.200]   It's called Villa Turquesa and it's in Cabo.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.200]   And we've been there for a handful of bachelor parties and it
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.880]   actually ended up being reasonable.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.040]   Especially my villa hack for this is if you're going with a group of people,
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:21.680]   divide the rooms up in a way that lets the friends of yours that have the money
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.600]   that want a little nicer, get something else.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.840]   So this particular house, if you look it up, has four bedrooms with a king bed,
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:32.280]   four bedrooms with two queen beds and one room with 12 bunk beds.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:37.080]   And so we priced it such that if you want your own room with your
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.840]   own bed, you pay a lot more.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.800]   And if you want your own bed that you only have to share with one person, you pay more.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.160]   And if you're okay being one of the 12 people in the bunk bedroom, you get a great deal.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.000]   And you'll have a hell of a party.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.600]   It's a fantastic house.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.400]   There's a chef named Lorenzo in the house, cooks whatever you want, but it ended up
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:53:00.560]   working out with a group of 20 people to be maybe a thousand dollars per person.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:05.040]   And that included enough money for all the food for maybe five days.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.520]   So it's incredible.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.160]   It's a great deal.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.040]   I want to say that also included all of our transportation.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.440]   Whenever I would plan a trip like this, I would try to come up with a dollar
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.720]   figure that would cover all the shuttles, all the activities.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.960]   One day we're going to rent a boat.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.000]   One day we're going to do this.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.280]   And the hack for me was I would plan a trip for 20 people.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.880]   I'd put the entire villa for five nights on my credit card.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.680]   I'd book the flights for all 20 people going down.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.360]   I would, obviously there's a little risk.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.880]   The one person who doesn't pay back.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.400]   Fortunately, if you ever book group flights, if you call the airline, you
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.800]   actually go to the group desk.
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:39.400]   They usually give you the wiggle room to drop one or two people in a group before
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.120]   the, or change the name or do something.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.520]   And so that's both how I accumulated a lot of points and found that for the right
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.160]   group with enough people, it can work really well.
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.240]   If you want to go to this house and you don't have kids and you're not going to
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:55.120]   use the bunk bedroom, then it's going to sleep a whole lot less people.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.320]   It might only be eight couples and that might be much less affordable, but it is
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.080]   possible.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.600]   I think it's a really cool experience to stay in a villa with a chef that can cook
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.320]   meals, especially, you know, in a time where you may be coming out of the
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.560]   pandemic, not ready to go to a super crowded resort.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.040]   Sure.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.280]   I'll give you one further hack on that, which is that a place like Villa Torquesa
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.280]   is probably marketing itself in 25 different directions.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.560]   And so what you should do before you get to work with Villa Torquesa is Google it
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:25.000]   and figure out where are they marketing and what are the prices on each of these
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.320]   places and go back to Villa Torquesa directly and say, Hey, listen, I see your
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.760]   marketing over there for a little cheaper.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.320]   Or I see that somebody over here is costing even more money.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.520]   If I were to book that with them, I want to book directly with you.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.120]   I want to pay the best available price.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.040]   What is that?
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:42.400]   All of those villa prices are slightly negotiable outside of peak periods.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.000]   So be sure to go directly to the ownership, not through an intermediary
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.120]   villa company, and ask them what are they willing to do if you book direct.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:49.880]   I love that.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:54.240]   And in our first episode on the show, you mentioned if you can't find them, take an
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.760]   image, do a Google image search of the core image of the property, and you can
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.280]   usually find the other websites that image appears on.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.400]   One last thing we didn't talk about with hotels is the kind of perks you get when
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.360]   you book them through a travel advisor.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.200]   Anyone can book most of these properties.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.520]   You want to book a Nauman, you want to book a Four Seasons or a St.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.760]   Regis, you can go on the website.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.840]   But when you book through someone who has a relationship with these brands and
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:21.080]   properties, like you do at tons of these resorts, you end up getting amenities
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:24.880]   that I talked about a few weeks back, this kind of hotel experiment that we're
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:30.120]   working on with all the hacks, where you might get an upgrade, free breakfast, a
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.160]   property credit, late checkout, an amenity in your room.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.560]   Because I got so many questions about that, I want to talk a little bit about how it
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:36.960]   works.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Generally, these hotels, my understanding is they want to extend perks to people
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.400]   who are related to clients that send lots of traffic, or how does it work?
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.480]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.720]   There are a couple of ways of getting these outsized perks at hotels.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.440]   One of them is having a high tier in loyalty, right?
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:58.320]   Having Marriott ambassador status means that Marriott knows who you are when you
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.240]   stay at a Marriott property.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.360]   And anybody at that property could tie into the Marriott database and look up
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.120]   Chris and say, "Oh, wow, he's fancy pants.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.920]   He runs a great podcast.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.640]   And he's a nice guy.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:07.360]   Let's take care of him."
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.480]   But that's where that sort of stops.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.240]   And it obviously stops with Marriott.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:15.320]   If you have no Hyatt status, or if you've never stayed at an Amman, they don't know
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:15.840]   anything about you.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   So the second way that hotels get a lot of their info and therefore assign a lot of
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.280]   perks is through this travel advisor relationship.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.600]   And that relationship is actually probably the strongest sales channel for hotels,
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.280]   because it develops a quality guest.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.560]   It says, "Hey, this is who Chris Hutchins is.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:36.400]   Whether he stays in a Marriott, a Hyatt, an Amman, a Rosewood, or whatever, this is
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.360]   who he is, and this is what he wants, and this is what his experience should be.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.120]   Can you help craft this?"
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:44.840]   And a good hotel, a four or five star hotel, will absolutely do that.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.200]   And in exchange for that, they'll give perks.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.600]   They'll say, "Look, we want Chris to come stay here, spend his money here.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:54.120]   So we are going to give him daily breakfast, and we're going to guarantee an upgrade
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:54.960]   for him at booking.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.360]   And we're going to make sure that every morning when we run our arrivals report of
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:03.240]   who's coming in that day, we flag him as a VIP and say, "Chris needs this."
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:05.480]   Or, "Let's give Chris his room assignment.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:09.160]   Let's give it an even better upgrade or a better view just because he came in through
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.400]   this channel, and we know things about him that we wouldn't know if Chris just booked
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:12.760]   online."
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.680]   So it's rate parity.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.920]   They're never going to give you like a crazier rate.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.520]   Four seasons doesn't discount, right?
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:24.160]   But they are going to give you a better experience by knowing the channel through
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:24.680]   which you came.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:29.120]   So you mentioned earlier that right now, this is mostly a channel restricted to
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:33.800]   travel advisors, or if you have an Amex Platinum card, or you have some other way
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.240]   of getting a perk program.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.960]   We're trying to democratize that, especially for all the Hacks listeners, a
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:41.960]   special way of getting that access, a sort of a self-serve model.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.800]   So more on that coming soon.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:49.480]   But the big takeaway from that is that the more a hotel knows about you, the better
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.840]   the experience will be, and they're willing to give you perks for that.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.640]   They're willing to say, "Hey, be part of this program as you book.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.200]   Give us some information on how we can make your stay special so that you're going to
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.520]   spend money here, and you're going to come back here, and you're going to tell all
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.440]   your friends about what a wonderful experience it was.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:05.600]   Here's some more perks."
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.840]   So if you're listening, that's a little bit more about the how and the why behind
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.960]   this kind of hotel perks and benefits experiment I mentioned.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:13.800]   Shoot us an email.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.960]   The email I made was getupgraded@allthehacks.com.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.200]   And the caveats, just because I've gotten a lot of questions, has to be a paid
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:21.600]   booking.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.920]   Unfortunately, a lot of these perks don't apply or none of them apply to award
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.200]   stays, and it has to be booked through our relationship.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.400]   So if you haven't booked yet, and you want to get some of these premium perks at
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:37.160]   probably almost 4,000 hotels around the world, shoot us an email.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.560]   I'll put the link in the show notes.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:42.840]   Just let us know where you're going, rough budget, and when you're going, and we'll
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.040]   see if we can help get you hooked up.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:48.760]   Last topic I wanted to go on was little tricks and tips when you are there that
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.000]   don't have to do with booking, don't have to do with flying.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.840]   One I want to ask first is around tipping.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:59:00.320]   What is the practical advice around tipping, not for daily housekeeping, but to
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.760]   enhance an experience?
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:05.560]   I watched Inventing Anna, or Anna, or however you want to pronounce her name,
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:10.520]   and she was handing out $100 bills around the hotel, and it just made me think, is
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:15.600]   there a benefit to giving a tip to the concierge, or the person checking you in
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:19.200]   in Vegas, or the person at the front desk of a restaurant?
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.640]   When is there not, right?
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.280]   If you have the means to do it, then absolutely, I would do it.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.120]   And I wouldn't always limit it to just money.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.520]   So let's use a concierge, and let's just say Paris, for example.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.120]   There are a couple of different ways of taking care of that concierge.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.760]   Number one, if you have developed via email a relationship with a particular
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:40.160]   concierge, before you arrive, one of the things you can do is write a note to the
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.200]   general manager and say, "Hey, Laurent has been amazing.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.840]   I just want you to know I'm so looking forward to my trip because Laurent has
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.720]   already dialed in all these experiences for me.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.680]   Thank you for employing somebody like Laurent."
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:55.600]   And that non-monetary bit of time that you just spent taking care of Laurent will go
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.440]   so far in making your experience even better before you get there.
[00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.280]   So that's number one.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.120]   Number two is, yeah, bring them a gift, bring them some little
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.680]   goody, and to say, "Thank you."
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   So that might mean that you buy La Duree Macarons the moment you arrive at Paris
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.840]   Charles de Gaulle Airport, and you have your VIP greeter stop you for a second to
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.800]   buy them, buy them a little treat, a little token of appreciation there, or even bring
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.440]   it from home, bring them Ghirardelli chocolate from California.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.440]   Not the best chocolate in the world, but it's something from San Francisco.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.240]   It's cool.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.320]   It ties you to a place, and it shows this intention of thank you, of gratitude, right?
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.800]   And then of course, give them money.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.480]   I like to tip concierges at the beginning of a stay, which will
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.320]   always help ensure wonderful service.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.160]   And then at the very end of a stay, if they've gone above and beyond,
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.680]   again, I would give them something.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.840]   What are you giving them?
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.920]   It's really up to you.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.880]   There is no guide.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.960]   I was talking with a hotelier in Paris, actually, and he said to me, "We've
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.120]   got some clients who tip a 20 euro a day, and they give it at the front.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.600]   And if the concierge has gone above and beyond while they're there, they give
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   them a little bit more at the end, another 20 or 50 euro."
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.320]   I know one guy who just tips a thousand dollars wherever he goes when he gets
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.880]   there, because he can do that, good for him.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.160]   Trust me, his service is exceptional, right?
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.000]   So it really depends on what you want to do, but any token of gratitude and
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.160]   appreciation is always appreciated, including just a simple email before and
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.400]   after the stay saying, "Hey, you did a great job.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:13.760]   Thank you."
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.160]   Can tipping ever unlock something?
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.040]   Can you walk into a restaurant and say, "Tip the hostess and get a table
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.280]   that you wouldn't otherwise gotten."
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.400]   Or I've often heard tipping the person checking you in, in Vegas, gets you a
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.120]   nicer room.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:27.400]   Right.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.960]   Have you had experience with those things?
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:29.440]   Do they work?
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.760]   I think in certain places, it absolutely works.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.000]   In Vegas, in Italy, in Paris, it can go a long way.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.160]   In Frankfurt or Zurich, I don't know if you're going to get the same reaction
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.920]   by tipping somebody 20 francs or euro.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.000]   It just depends on what the local custom is.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.120]   In Japan, that might seem very odd to receive a tip at check-in from someone.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.040]   But if you wrote them a lovely note and handed it to them with two hands at
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.120]   check-in, that might be a different story, and accompany that with a gift.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.240]   So really, yes, the answer is it can unlock experiences for you, for sure.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.120]   It has to be culturally appropriate to the market that you're in.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.320]   And if you have questions about that, look online and look ahead of time and
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.920]   say like tipping concierge or tipping at check-in and seeing what will happen.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.000]   What won't work is you're not going to get an upgrade if you give a flight
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   attendant 20 bucks.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.880]   You're not, they're going to be pissed at you.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.120]   The same thing with a gate agent at an airport, right?
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.280]   Those things don't work.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.760]   You can, which I've done, absolutely bring flight attendants chocolate and
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.400]   say, Hey, I know how hard you're working.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:22.920]   Thank you.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.640]   And watch what the service you get is.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.280]   It's exceptional.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.280]   No matter what a cabin of service you're in.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:32.320]   The followup question naturally is, is there anything you can do to get an
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.960]   upgrade on a flight for free without using your points and miles?
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960]   It sounds like the answer is no.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.400]   I have no recommendable options other than enhancing your on flight service
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.640]   experience by bringing gifts for the flight attendants.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.120]   I love doing that anyway, because they're some of the hardest working
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.480]   people in hospitality.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.680]   That's a crazy job and think about how many crazy people are
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680]   yelling at them at all times.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.800]   Take care of them, bring them treats, bring them chocolates.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.400]   Just even just saying, thank you.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.840]   Some loyalty programs will give certain status members, like there's a little
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.320]   like certificates that you can then give away to a flight attendant to say, Hey,
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.280]   thank you did a great job.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.480]   And I've actually written in to request more from American airlines
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.240]   and they've sent them to me.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.600]   So that's also useful to know is that American United, they used to Delta for a
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.560]   little while, they used to give you these certificates, ask your loyalty
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.800]   program, if they have anything that you can use to reward their staff, they
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.880]   might just direct you to some online form, which is worthless.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.320]   If they have a physical thing you can give away that, that goes, that goes miles.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.120]   All right.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.680]   Last thing is about organizing stuff on the ground.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:37.040]   I know we talked on this in our first episode, but if we're focused on the
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.840]   higher end, are there concierge services?
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.120]   Is it the hotel?
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:47.320]   Is it things like quintessentially that can unlock stuff or are most of these
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:53.000]   services more about saving you the time and energy of organizing than actual access?
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.200]   All of the above.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.920]   So it depends on the experience you want to have.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.080]   And I'll give you an example.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:01.520]   If you want to go to the formula one track in Monza in Italy, okay.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.680]   There are multiple ways of going about that, right?
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.000]   You can go to the formula one track and find out, Hey, how do I get access here?
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.800]   And if they say to you, Oh, sorry, it's private only, or you can't, you're a
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.200]   schlub or whatever it is, then you look at step B.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.480]   Well, who sells just access to that?
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.800]   Is there a racing club?
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.000]   Is there a formula one focused tourism experience that I could look at
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.440]   where I could buy access that way?
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:28.000]   What hotel you think, can you ask them and can you see what they can do?
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.840]   Do they recommend not working with the concierge, but working with a local
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.920]   ticket provider or something else, right?
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:33.720]   Yes.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.280]   You can go to a DMC that oversees a region and they might look at all of Northern
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.880]   Italy, or they might be responsible for all of Italy and say to them, Hey, listen,
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.200]   I want to do this experience in Monza, but I also want to go to this restaurant
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.560]   and this, and they can help you put together that whole experience.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.640]   Or it might be something that is so hyper-focused that you would want to
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.200]   use a service like a quintessentially where they're putting together an entire
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.560]   trip for you based around one experience.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.760]   I want to go golfing at St.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.200]   Andrew's.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.560]   I want to do the racetrack.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.600]   I want to do driving here.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.320]   I want to do whatever.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.880]   And then they literally craft a trip around that.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.840]   Whether it's a travel designer or a membership club, like quintessentially,
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.680]   I would recommend looking at that to see who can help you build that rounded
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.840]   trip with the guarantee of access to the key thing it is that you want.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:18.440]   But I would always first start with what is that service?
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.240]   What is that place I want to go?
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:23.720]   And is there a way of cutting out all the middlemen first, directly getting access?
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.640]   And if I can't do that, then keep going in the concentric circles thereafter.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.320]   I haven't used quintessentially or any of the other high-end concierge services.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.680]   They're quite expensive thousands of dollars a year.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.200]   I'm actually thinking maybe it would be a fun episode to bring someone on from
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.880]   them and just talk about where they add value, how that works.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.600]   So that's something we'll do in the future.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.360]   I think that's all I got for this episode right now.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.000]   I'm sure we're going to come up with more.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.760]   We'll have Lee back on a third time.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.360]   Before we go, where can people stay in tune with what you're working on?
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.000]   My name is spelled in a funny way.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.040]   It's Lee, L E I G H.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.120]   And last name Rowan, R O W A N.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:01.200]   The company is Savanti Travel, S A V A N T I Travel.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.840]   Hit me up online.
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.840]   I'm always here to be helpful however I can.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.160]   I'm so appreciative of the opportunity to see you again in this beautiful place
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.200]   and to check in again on these fun topics.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:16.000]   And again, I'm giving you huge kudos on the millions of listeners you've had,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.680]   the incredible success and these luminary guests of which I am just a mere peon.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:25.640]   Well, the advice you've given in our first episode to reach out to the hotel,
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:30.640]   to get upgraded has easily been the most emailed topic I've gotten from any
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:34.040]   listener. So many people have been upgraded because of it.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.840]   Shout out to one listener,
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.120]   Janie who actually had her initials embroidered into a pillow.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.600]   That was so cool.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.320]   It was wild. So, you know,
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.760]   your hacks in the first episode and this one will hook up hundreds of people.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.080]   Thank you and hope to do it again soon.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.000]   Thank you so much, Chris.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.920]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode. Thank you so much for listening.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.280]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.560]   or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.280]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me,
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.600]   or just want to say hi,
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:08.720]   I'm Chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.880]   That's it for this week. I'll see you next week.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:30.440]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.040]   money.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.560]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.960]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast,
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.960]   and it's much more about building generational wealth and spending your money
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.680]   on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.560]   It's hosted by my good friend,
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.520]   Andrew who truly believes that everyone in this world can build wealth and his
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.000]   passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.920]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022,
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:02.640]   but recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.640]   will blow your mind.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:08.600]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.240]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.880]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.840]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.600]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:24.240]   your money and grow your wealth. So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.440]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify,
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.080]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
