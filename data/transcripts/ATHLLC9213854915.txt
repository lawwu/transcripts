[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.060]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who joined the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.620]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.220]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.140]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.300]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.180]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.460]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.480]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.780]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.020]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.660]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.860]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.020]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.540]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have none other than
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.620]   Lee Rowan here for another episode.
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.140]   Now, for those of you who don't know, Lee was my first guest on the podcast,
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.780]   and he is one of the most knowledgeable people I know when it comes to travel
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020]   hacking and really all things travel.
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.140]   He currently runs a high-end travel company called Savanti, where he's
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.580]   helped clients plan incredible trips to every corner of the world.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.820]   He's also a travel hacker himself, and before Savanti, he
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.940]   was the COO of The Points Guy.
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.300]   So why bring Lee back again?
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.980]   Well, if you listened to episode one, you wouldn't even doubt that decision.
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.660]   But this time, Lee is going to give us a glimpse into the travel
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.580]   lifestyles of the rich and famous.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.580]   Think private jets, luxury villas, and everything else.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.460]   But we're also going to talk about how you could hack some of these luxuries
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.220]   into your own life for a whole lot less.
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.980]   This is a really fun episode with some great hacks, so I hope you enjoy it.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.100]   Let's jump in.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.860]   Lee, thank you for being here again, first, second time guest.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.620]   I am incredibly honored to be here again.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.380]   I'm incredibly honored to be back here after you've already had a
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.180]   million downloads, 50 plus episodes.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.420]   You've interviewed Olympians, New York Times bestsellers, and somehow I'm here.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.020]   Thank you.
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.260]   First person to have on second, your episode has done the best of all time.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.180]   I think in part from Tim Ferriss' comparison to you and Hugh Jackman, he
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.580]   put you on a pretty high pedestal.
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.620]   That was incredibly humbling.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.900]   My wife is still trying to get me off that pedestal, but it's great to be up there.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.740]   Well, I got an email and it made me think, I think we should get Lee back here.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.420]   So I'm going to read it.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.900]   So Alberto sent an email in and said, "Hey, Chris, love your podcast.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.220]   And I'd love to hear more about ultra high-end travel experiences.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.220]   Even though not every listener can benefit from them, certainly many aspire to them.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.660]   And all of them likely enjoy hearing about these possibilities.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.100]   So to me, that's what options do people have to fly private?
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.860]   How does that compare to first class?
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.740]   What premium programs aren't advertised that airlines and hotels offer?
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.740]   What kinds of experiences can a great concierge cover, et cetera?"
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.100]   So I can't think of anyone who knows that space better than you.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.340]   Well, you already heard in the intro, but this is what Lee does.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.860]   Like he plans these experiences.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.940]   So I thought that would be a fun conversation to have and
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.300]   worth having you back on again.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.820]   Awesome.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.540]   Well, thank you.
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.300]   We can definitely dive into the travel lifestyles of the rich and famous, but I
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.260]   will caveat it by saying a couple of things.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.020]   Number one is that not all of these experiences are off limits to the not rich
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.660]   and famous.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.460]   I myself don't think that I can afford necessarily a private jet, but I've been
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.500]   lucky enough to fly private once or twice or have these incredible concierge
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.740]   experiences at hotels where if you just know the right angle, then you can really
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.940]   up your travel game, your travel experiences.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.180]   So definitely happy to talk about what people pay for and maybe some other great
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.300]   area of where you can kind of hack your way in.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.140]   Perfect.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.300]   The big question out there, something that I've never booked a private jet.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.180]   I've had the luxury of being invited to go on a flight from LA to San Francisco
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.660]   once.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.140]   It was quite the nice experience.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.420]   What does private jet travel look like?
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.140]   Is it incredibly expensive?
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.780]   Just kind of like set the standard for people on what is the experience and how
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.620]   much does it cost?
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.860]   If you had asked me this in our first meeting almost a year ago, where we
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.420]   recorded the first podcast, I would have said private aviation is booming.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.820]   And I would have thought that we were at the very, very peak of the market, like
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.740]   the stock market, private aviations market has gone even higher since then.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.340]   So right now, private is very expensive and it's exclusive, right?
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.020]   You have your own jet to yourself unless you're lucky enough to be invited on
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.060]   somebody else's jet for a short hop somewhere.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.700]   But because of that, and because of gas prices and just the demand on the market,
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.980]   it is incredibly expensive.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.140]   But the question is, how do you go about finding a, a jet B, a deal on a jet?
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.100]   And there are ways of doing that.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.700]   So there are search engines that are out there for jets.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.180]   Some people turn to brokers.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.940]   Some people in the travel industry have their own operator relationships where
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.220]   you can call up an operator and say, Hey, I'd like to charter a light jet or a
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.940]   midsize jet or a heavy jet, or one of those big business jets, because I've got
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.780]   to take X amount of people from San Francisco to New York, right?
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.460]   And then they get back to these quotes that are exceptional.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.500]   It used to be, you could take a super midsize jet nonstop across the country,
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.060]   and it would be something like 25 or 30 grand one way.
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.820]   And super midsize, how many people?
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.060]   Yeah, about nine people, give or take, right?
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.100]   Depends on the jet and the configuration of the seating.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.420]   Is there a lavatory seat, which is literally like somebody has to actually
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.700]   sit on top of a closed lavatory for takeoff and landing.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.620]   What does that look like?
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.580]   But generally nine people on a super mid coast to coast.
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.540]   It used to be about 25 or 30 grand one way.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.300]   And now you're seeing that push up by 40, 45, sometimes 50 grand just to
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.900]   get coast to coast on a private jet.
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.100]   So when I talked earlier about how the market is impacted and the prices have
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.860]   gone up, it's true, they've gone through the roof, but the dirty secret about
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.420]   private aviation is that not every flight is lined up with a buyer.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.060]   For instance, let's say they're taking a jet from the Bay area to the New York
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.660]   area, and now they've got to get that jet from New York down to
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.020]   Florida for the next client.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.580]   Well, it's going to fly empty.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.580]   And so the way to fly private for cheap, not for free, but for cheap to hack
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.300]   it is to find an empty leg that works for you.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.420]   Now operators of those private empty legs are savvy.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.900]   And so they're not going to let it go for free or even really for that cheap.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.620]   But instead of spending what would be 25, $30,000 on a one way flight, you
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.100]   might get it for five, seven, eight, 10.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.140]   And if you think about it, the cost of a commercial first class seat might
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.900]   be a thousand or more dollars on that route.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.500]   So now if you have an empty leg that you can buy and you can fill it with eight
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.060]   or nine people paying a thousand bucks each, well, hey, you just paid for your
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.620]   empty leg.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.740]   So if you get very lucky, you know how to play the market, find the right sort of
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.260]   buys, and you can see those empty legs and fill them with people that you might
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.580]   know, then you can end up flying private for pretty cheap.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.620]   Where does that end up happening on the busiest routes you'd suspect, right?
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.780]   I got to get a jet from the Bay area down to LA so it can fly.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.180]   It's going to go empty.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.420]   Let me try to fill it up.
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.260]   It's always last minute, 72 hours or less out.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.540]   And sometimes you can get lucky and get a deal.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.780]   And is there a place online to look for these deals?
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.780]   Oh boy, there's a bunch.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.500]   And we'll put some resources online later to show people where to look.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.900]   It's definitely a rabbit hole.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.020]   You got to go down and educate yourself on, but there are some empty leg listings
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:14.620]   online.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.500]   There are some operators that publish them online on a weekly or bi-weekly
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.060]   basis.
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.980]   There are some of these membership groups that you can be a part of and you can pay
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.340]   to get access to empty legs.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.300]   They're just marketing a collection of lists that they've culled together.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.780]   But generally speaking, if you invest time and energy into learning a lot about how
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.140]   the market works and where to find these lists, you might be able to find yourself
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.020]   one or two deals a year that you could work on.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:44.020]   But at the end of the day, the deals we're talking about are flying private at the
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.740]   cost of commercial first class if you can fill the plane.
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.580]   If you can fill the plane.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.420]   It's all conditional.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.260]   It's never going to be, I want to go to LA.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.420]   Can I get a empty leg for 200 bucks or can I get a seat on a G450 that has to
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.060]   reposition?
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.500]   That just won't happen, right?
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.460]   So I think that's a really good example here, Chris, that you have to expectation
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.220]   set, right?
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.420]   You're not going to just fly private by using your points from your Chase Sapphire
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.100]   preferred and looking on a search engine online and it happens, right?
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.100]   It's a very calculated process that you have to get very lucky with a lot of stars
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.500]   lining to have happen.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.260]   And if you can do it great, it's an incredible experience.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.980]   Is it the best and I'll be all of flying?
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.180]   No, but it's pretty great if you can do it.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.420]   And just to kind of benchmark where you gave a couple examples, is there something
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.980]   that's like roughly for the most common type of plane dollars per hour?
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.740]   So if someone listening is just thinking like, what would it cost to fly to Cabo
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.660]   for the weekend or somewhere?
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.020]   Is there a benchmark?
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.220]   There used to be, and it used to be based on plane size.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.180]   You can get an approximate hourly rate, but there are so many variables to
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:55.860]   consider that it's so hard to say this is the ballpark cost, especially given a
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.860]   aviation fuel prices lately and be the impacting of the market of how much demand
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.780]   there is for private.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.900]   It's just insane.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.460]   So I wish I could say to you, Oh, heavy jet should be 10 grand an hour.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.940]   That would be great.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.620]   Sometimes you can get a heavy jet for eight grand an hour, and sometimes more
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.300]   often than not, it's 16 grand an hour.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.220]   So you just really can't ballpark it.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.100]   Well, I mean, you just did eight to $16,000 an hour.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.700]   Heavy jet seats up to 14 to 15, depending on the jet and depending on where you're
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.460]   going, right?
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.820]   Because you can't fly 14 people from LA to Europe nonstop, but you could maybe if
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.780]   you did it with eight.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.500]   Okay.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.940]   The kinds of experiences that you see people having people that are taking their
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.700]   family of four people on a private jet, it's probably a smaller plane.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.060]   Is that closer?
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.620]   I know you can't ballpark, but like $5,000 an hour, how wide is the swing?
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.620]   That's the benchmark I've always been told is like, if you want a small
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.020]   plane, but it's not a prop plane, it's a jet, it's like 5,000 an hour.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.180]   So New York, 30 grand.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.180]   Now I know you said, ah, things have gone up.
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.500]   Maybe it's 15, 20, maybe it's six grand an hour or something like that.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.900]   But is that in the ballpark?
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.940]   It could be in the ballpark.
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.780]   And it, again, depends on the jet itself, where you're going to and from.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.740]   Honestly, you know, flying West to East is a lot easier because you've got tail
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.780]   winds and a jet can go a little further, but flying East to West and with a heavier
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.100]   load and a full load of people in the plane, it ends up being a lot more
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.820]   expensive, a lot longer time in that plane.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.620]   The other piece to keep in mind too, is what is that plane doing while you're there?
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.740]   Are you going a one way or are you doing a round trip, right?
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.100]   If a plane is sitting and waiting for you, you're paying that operator to
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.580]   literally just have it sit there empty, underutilized, doing nothing.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.380]   If that plane is moving around and then popping back to pick you up later on,
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.180]   well, then maybe the operator can make some money on those other legs.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.060]   But if they're based out in California and you're flying them to New York, you
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.700]   better hope that they can get some business along the East coast by the time
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.540]   that they've got to return.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.740]   Otherwise you're just paying for that dead time.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.940]   When you cross borders, it's a whole different ball of wax.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.820]   There's this thing called cabotage that I love to talk about because it's so
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.180]   confusing and it's like an 1860s maritime law, but it basically says anytime you
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.500]   cross a border on one type of vessel, you have to cross that same border on the
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.900]   same type of vessel coming back.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.460]   And it's very confusing, but long story short, you can't fly down on one kind of
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.620]   private jet and come back on a different kind of private jet into and out of
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.500]   Mexico or Canada because the operator either won't take your business or the
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.740]   authorities there might get upset with you and charge you fines and a whole
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.380]   bunch of other stuff.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:28.380]   So is a lot of private travel done domestically and internationally?
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.820]   It just is too far distance.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.980]   So it ends up being too expensive.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.860]   Are these rules or what's the most common use case for private travel?
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.420]   It honestly depends on the consumer.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.860]   It depends on what that client needs and what they're trying to accomplish, right?
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:44.300]   Some people have a very tight schedule and private allows them that freedom of
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.100]   having the time to do what they need to do in the order they want to do it.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.940]   For some people, it's about convenience.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.380]   They just want to show up at an FBO, don't have to worry about security.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.780]   Somebody else handles their bags and voila, they're off to the next place.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.580]   And it's just done like that for them.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.660]   For some people, it is about true luxury and they just don't want to have anything
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.300]   less than perfection.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.420]   And that's what private affords them.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.660]   There's no worrying about a commercial aircraft delay or a crew delay or
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.300]   whatever, you're in control.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.980]   You say, I want to go 15 minutes later, an hour later, the plane waits for you.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.580]   It's not like, uh, you miss your Delta flight.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.340]   Cause you're like, I'll be there a little later, right?
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.060]   That would never happen.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.820]   So it really depends on who, who the person is and what their motivating
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.060]   factor of flying is.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.220]   But I can tell you that over the past six years of running this business, I have
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.780]   seen more private demand over the last 18 months than I would have ever imagined.
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:38.260]   And I would probably just even say we've done more private aviation travel in the
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.780]   last 18 months than we did in the entire first five years of our business's
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.260]   existence.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.100]   And do you think that keeps up or do you think part of that, I assume is because
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.940]   we had this pandemic where people didn't want to be around other people on an
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.300]   airplane, but maybe you still wanted to travel.
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:56.380]   Has it waned a little bit in the last few months as travels picked up and resumed?
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.260]   Not really.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.900]   I think what's been interesting is some of the trends in private aviation have
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.900]   shifted to people who they used to maybe not fly private all the time.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:10.500]   And now they're only flying private and it's a easily accessible commercial route
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.900]   with a private like experience, i.e.
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.340]   I can fly from San Francisco to JFK and a live flat seat in a cabin of 12 people,
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:17.660]   right?
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.620]   Even though there's other cabins on that aircraft that have more people in them.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.220]   My first class cocoon feels like a private jet to me.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.980]   And then they'll do that over flying transcontinentally private.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.940]   Obviously people aren't electing to as much flight internationally, right?
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.780]   It's transoceanically in private jets because that is so very expensive.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.660]   Flying from the East coast to Europe could easily run you 80 to a hundred
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.860]   grand one way, which is a lot of money.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.940]   And when you can get a very lovely first class experience on Lufthansa or Air
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.980]   France or Swiss for a 10th of that, it's a pretty easy mathematical equation there.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.340]   When we went to Bora Bora a couple of weeks ago, we landed on the tarmac in Bora
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.860]   Bora, tiny airport, like really small airport.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.860]   And we saw, I can't remember what it was.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.860]   I'm going to misquote it.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.300]   I think it was a Boeing business jet.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.340]   And I was like, wow, this person flew private.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.940]   Now the cool thing, if anyone ever sees a private jet, you could look at the tail
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.220]   number.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.380]   You could type it online and see where did this person come from?
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:13.740]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.020]   And I couldn't believe it.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.100]   So the person came from San Francisco and because the Bora Bora airport has no
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.340]   immigration, they also had to fly San Francisco to Papiete.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.700]   They had to get off the plane.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.340]   You could see that the plane sat there for an hour.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.260]   They must've gone through immigration, done their COVID testing, gotten
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.940]   back on, flew that plane, the 30 minute route.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.980]   And all I could think about was they saved some time, right?
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.420]   We got to San Francisco an hour before our flight, hour 20 before our flight.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.460]   They might've gotten to San Francisco 30 minutes before their flight.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:44.860]   Right.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:49.580]   But in the grand scheme of things, it still took them almost 10 hours and maybe
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.580]   they saved an hour, but I'm guessing people listening know that I did it on
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:58.300]   points, but I'm guessing that was not a $3,000 charter.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:58.980]   No, sir.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.820]   No, no.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.860]   That was a very substantial amount of money that those people spent for what
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.500]   I'm sure was an incredible trip for a private group, right?
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:10.380]   You don't think of somebody taking a BBJ for three people, right?
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.580]   It probably was a group of a dozen or 15 people on that plane flying that route,
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.580]   having a great time together.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.540]   And that is great.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.580]   If that can work out with their schedule and their economics, good for them.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.580]   But you and I are going to fly United.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.220]   And when you can fly United and find availability and last minute, especially,
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.100]   yeah, we booked it with Air Canada miles because it was less, but we got what I
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.020]   would argue is a very similar experience.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.340]   We had a lay flat bed.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.700]   Someone brought us food.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.300]   It wasn't exactly the same.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.580]   The plane left when the plane wanted to leave, didn't leave when we wanted to,
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:46.020]   but for us, it was a points in $30 versus what I'm guessing was over six figures,
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:46.380]   which.
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.900]   Well, well over six figures.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.340]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:48.860]   Good for them.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.980]   What's the experience like though?
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.420]   You've gotten to do it a few times.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.060]   Food, service, are there flight attendants?
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.500]   You know, paint a picture for what it's like from the moment you pull up, what
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.060]   happens, what's that experience like?
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.460]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.300]   So let's start from the very, very top, right?
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.220]   You get a special address at a commercial airport that you're flying out of.
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.660]   That is not the regular passenger terminal and that's called the FBO.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.900]   That's the area where all of the private planes fly out of.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.020]   It's usually on the opposite side of the airport from the passenger terminals.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.380]   So you pull up there and you literally walk into a building or sometimes they'll
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.900]   even drive you out directly onto the tarmac to meet your plane.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:22.780]   You drop your bags.
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.860]   And from the moment you do that, someone else takes care of everything.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:29.740]   So the pilots will walk you through walking a visual inspection around the
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.780]   plane, if you want to see it and take a look at what little parts of the plane
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.220]   do and educate you and you get on the plane and you can choose whatever seat
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.420]   you want because it's your plane.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.220]   So there's no assigned seating per se.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.220]   You asked about catering.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.260]   You can pre-select what is sort of a standard stock of catering.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.700]   And that varies by operator, but generally speaking, there's waters and
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.140]   snacks and some bottles of wine, little bottles of booze and things like that.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.420]   But you can also augment that by bringing your own catering or working with the
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.020]   operator to have them cater the vessel for you.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.820]   Thing to note about catering is that if you think getting a private jet is
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:08.620]   expensive, you have not seen a $65 club sandwich yet because it's unreal what
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.620]   those catering bills are.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.140]   We'll see catering bills sometimes in the multiple thousands for
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.580]   not that fancy of a meal.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.340]   Wow.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.780]   It's pretty exceptional.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.380]   So I always love just recommending people to bring Uber Eats or bring food
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.220]   from home that you love.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.940]   Though, I guess if you're spending a hundred thousand dollars on a flight,
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.820]   it's a rounding error, but even I guess people that fly private want a little
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.100]   hack to save money on food.
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.220]   I always recommend that.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.900]   There are flight attendants on some of these flights, especially on the heavy
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.380]   jets and ultra long range jets.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.500]   Generally speaking, you know, not something that I see on a lot of like
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.980]   midsize or smaller jets because there's really no need, especially because
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.220]   those jets have a limited mission size.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.020]   They're going on a four or five hour trip.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.540]   Maybe at most you don't really need service during that time.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.300]   One of the things I find so interesting about flying private is that generally
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.060]   the cockpit doors open at any kind of point in the flight.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.940]   You can stroll on in and be like, how are we doing folks?
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.100]   Sit down on a jump seat and kind of take a look at the instrumentation
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.740]   and see how the plane is flown.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.540]   And that to me is the, it's probably one of the coolest parts of flying
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.860]   private is that you're with the crew.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.660]   They get to know you, you get to know them.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.380]   I've had crew write thank you notes to passengers of mine because they've
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.580]   developed friendships on these short flights.
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.820]   And that's really lovely because you get to feel like you're part of
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.620]   the operation if you choose to do so.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.980]   If you want privacy and you want to be locked back in your cabin, no problem.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:27.860]   You can do that too.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.380]   And then when you land, what does that look like?
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.060]   Like, do you just get off the plane and leave?
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.820]   Do you go through the airport?
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.740]   We didn't mention before you board, is there security?
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.940]   What is the kind of ins and outs of getting on the plane?
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.900]   Yeah, generally there's no security, depending on the flight and where
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.940]   you're going, if it's trans border, there'll be a little bit of a document
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.140]   check, the passengers will have to make sure that the manifest matches what
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.100]   their IDs are and the pilots will usually do that, but generally there's
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.220]   no security of anything to speak of.
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.340]   When you land, this is kind of the best part is you just stroll off the plane.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.580]   I happened to get very lucky and get an empty leg to go to Bozeman, Montana,
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.060]   and I brought my daughter along with me.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.700]   And when we got off the plane, our rental car was right there, plain side.
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.140]   And what I mean right there, plain side, I mean, like maybe
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.540]   three feet from the stairs.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.020]   We just strolled in through our backpacks in the trunk and drove away.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.300]   It was the coolest experience to be driving on the tarmac next to
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.260]   your plane is just like unreal.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.300]   So convenience, ease, sure.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.180]   It makes total sense.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:25.900]   Price.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.340]   I mean, I makes sense for everybody.
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.660]   I wouldn't even know if I can call this a hack, but there's an airline, you
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.300]   know, they don't fly all over the country called JSX.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.780]   The best.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:41.780]   And for maybe like 2x the cost of economy, it's not even as expensive as
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.500]   first class domestically.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.980]   You can fly JSX.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.980]   They fly.
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.780]   You would know better than me.
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.740]   What types of planes?
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:47.980]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.700]   They're ERJs.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.860]   They're little regional, regional jets made by Embraer.
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:51.940]   They're 30 seats.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:57.300]   So the window seat a by itself, and then there's B and C sitting together, 10
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:01.020]   rows, and they're exceptional for the value, for the fact that you do pull up
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.260]   to an FBO again, across the airport at Oakland or Las Vegas or Burbank or
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.220]   wherever you're flying, you're not at the regular passenger terminal and you go
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.740]   through a light security check there.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:11.620]   They check your ID.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.860]   They sort of wand your bag and make sure that there's nothing funky there.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.980]   And then that's it.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.860]   You fly on this plane, you land, and it's the same process.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.540]   When you get to Las Vegas, you walk right through the terminal and you're right
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.860]   outside and there's a taxi cab waiting for you.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:29.940]   And by terminal, Lee means like literally a small building, like an office, like I
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:36.580]   would say out the door to the Uber or Lyft you call is measured maybe in seconds
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.700]   or maybe one or two minutes, maybe 30 seconds.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.740]   If you stop to pee, it's a minute.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.500]   It's really not that.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:40.740]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.300]   So that is an exceptional experience.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.900]   And for the dollar value of that, it's great.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.740]   You don't have to worry about being in a crowded terminal, getting there
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.580]   an hour and a half early, all that nonsense.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.700]   So I'd say you don't get the plane to yourself.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.420]   The plane leaves when it wants to leave.
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.540]   It's still on schedule.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:00.540]   But if you want to experience what it's like to go to the FBO terminal, to get
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.420]   on, to walk off the plane, and you just want to do that for, I'd say probably
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.100]   2x the cost of a normal economy flight, you know, you could do that with JSX.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.500]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.220]   I get it.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.500]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.820]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.900]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.780]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.300]   app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.380]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.180]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:39.260]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.140]   you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.140]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.380]   to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.700]   houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.180]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.860]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.860]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.780]   family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.860]   than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.860]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.780]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.140]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:27.780]   So when people who would otherwise fly private are flying commercially, I
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.500]   know there's actually some experiences you can have at the airport, changing
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:37.260]   planes when you land, that maybe we've casually seen as normal travelers,
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.140]   someone holding a sign or something at the airport.
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.060]   What are those experiences like?
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.780]   Talk a little bit about first-class terminals and greeters.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.500]   Yeah, there's two levels of this experience.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:52.700]   One is sort of accessible to all, and the other is less accessible to all.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.740]   So the greeters, those people who are holding the placards when you land and
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.140]   who are not associated maybe with a wheelchair, right, are there waiting for
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.980]   a VIP. There are people who are greeting you at the jet bridge of your aircraft
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.060]   when you arrive, and they're going to be the ones bringing you through all the
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.380]   formalities that follow.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:14.580]   So let's say you fly from Dallas to Paris and you land in Paris, and there is
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.140]   somebody standing at the gate with a sign saying Hutchins.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.620]   You and Amy get off and you go with that person, and they then take you through
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.620]   the following steps.
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.940]   They'll take you through customs and immigration through a fast line, whether
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.860]   that's a diplomatic line or a not crowded line or whatever it is, it's a line where
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.340]   you don't have to wait in line, which is great.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.260]   They'll then help you expedite and grab your bags, and then they'll bring you
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.740]   onwards to the next experience that's waiting for you.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.860]   If that's a connecting flight, they'll help you recheck, go through security
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.380]   again, get on that flight.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.500]   If it's a ground transfer, they'll know exactly where your ground transfer is, and
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.780]   they'll walk you out to that, making sure, of course, to stop you at a bathroom or an
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.340]   ATM or a croissant stand or whatever it is you might need.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:56.820]   And that service is actually surprisingly affordable, and in my opinion, one of the
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:02.740]   most underutilized and highly valuable options that a family can use when going
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.180]   to Europe, especially in the summer.
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:10.820]   It could be $300 for a family of four to have a VIP arrival experience, highly
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.340]   recommended.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.500]   At certain airports, you can also do that on the departure side, not usually in the
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.420]   States, but you could, but especially overseas.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.860]   And in a crowded place like Rome in the summer, highly recommend that as well.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:27.380]   I know in the U.S., for example, if you fly to SFO and you happen to be United's
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:31.380]   invite-only status, global services, there's actually a separate room, and you just go
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.900]   in this room and they check you in, they take your bags, and then they actually just
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.740]   like put you at the front of the security line.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.140]   Right.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.420]   Is that something that you can, instead of having to spend tens of thousands of
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.300]   dollars on United, you could just pay for and kind of have a similar experience?
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.420]   Domestically, it's a little harder because of our democratic notions here in the
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.500]   States that it's hard to buy sort of elite access to things.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.980]   There are ways of doing it in some airports, but generally speaking,
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.780]   domestically, especially on arrival, but even on departure, it's very hard to get
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.620]   to the front of the line.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.820]   Overseas, it's a whole different ball of wax.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:08.980]   So you want to spend a certain amount of money in any foreign airport.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.980]   There's a greeter service for arrivals and departures that will allow you to
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.380]   basically cut the line, get to the best lounge, and then have somebody walk you
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.660]   from that lounge to the plane when you want.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.740]   Are you going to board first?
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.540]   Are you going to board last?
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.180]   This is always a choice they give you, right?
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.580]   So that greeter and lounge experience is generally available
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.660]   for purchase everywhere.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.900]   Now you mentioned also earlier lounges.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.980]   What are those exceptional lounge experiences that people can have access
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.380]   to here in the States?
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.340]   We've got one out of LAX called PS, the private suite, which is pretty
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:36.900]   exceptional.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.780]   It's on the opposite side of the airport from the passenger terminal to the South
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.620]   side, and it is a two part place.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.780]   One is a salon where it's open to a smaller group of the public.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.420]   And the other is a private suite, which is just open to you.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.460]   Prices are pretty steep.
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.100]   They start in the five hundreds and go to five thousands per use per person.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.260]   So it can get a little crazy, but the experience is unparalleled.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.740]   You check in there, you do security there.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:08.260]   They drive you to the foot of your plane, to the gate, to get you boarding,
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.260]   whether it's again, first or last on your plane directly from this suite.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.220]   So you don't have to see the airport at all.
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.340]   You check your bags there.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.500]   You do customs there.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.660]   When you arrive there, like it's seamless and easy and beautiful.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.340]   So if you're flying into or out of, or even via LAX, it can make sense
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.860]   depending on the party and the cost and what you're trying to do.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.980]   But mostly in the U S we can rely on our TSA pre, we can rely on clear and we can
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.620]   kind of make the airport pretty smooth.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.180]   Chances are most people listening and have a card with priority pass.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.660]   You can go to a lounge internationally.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.060]   And I would say sometimes if you're flying internationally in business
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.260]   class and a lot of the Middle Eastern airlines, they include this.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.700]   So we went to Qatar once and it included this greeter experience.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.140]   And it was like, let's skip the whole line here.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.100]   When you come back, let's skip the whole line.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.780]   And I was like, wow, that was fancy.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.940]   And then I looked it up and I think it was, I could be really wrong here,
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.620]   but it was like $80.
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:06.860]   It was not like $5,000, definitely worth looking up traveling overseas.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.820]   And LAX sounds, I can't come up with an experience where I would want to spend
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:15.540]   $500 to get to the airport and have it easier, but you know, that's for someone.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.420]   That is for someone.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.900]   And there are some domestic airfare deals where that's actually bundled in.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.140]   So you can take a look, you know, United has a deal.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.980]   American has a deal with PS at LAX on certain flights.
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.060]   So if you happen to be transiting LAX in the next couple of months or years, it's
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.740]   worth taking a look at it to see if it makes sense for you.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.300]   All right.
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.500]   So I think we covered a lot on flights.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.580]   I'm going to ask a question that has nothing to do with super high end, but I
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.580]   was flying back from Bora Bora on United.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.420]   And I think this was the first time I ever noticed this new cabin.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.820]   I think they call it premium plus.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:50.580]   And I feel like for a long time, there was premium economy and then it was gone.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.860]   And then all the airlines domestically started adding economy plus and comfort
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:59.260]   plus, which was basically coach with a little more leg room and maybe some extra
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:28:59.820]   snacks.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.820]   And I saw premium plus and the flight was empty.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:08.220]   There was one person in all maybe 30 seats, but it looked pretty nice.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:14.340]   Is premium economy coming back and for people trying to really maximize dollars
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.820]   or miles, is it a pretty viable option?
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.100]   How does it compare to business or first?
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.300]   This is a great question.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:25.900]   So premium economy is a thing, and it is also a super confusing thing because
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.020]   airlines have done a terrible job of distinguishing what is an actual premium
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:35.980]   economy cabin versus what's a premium economy seat.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:42.980]   For example, on United, there is economy plus, which they used to call their
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:47.660]   premium economy seat until they actually put in a premium economy cabin.
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.100]   Premium plus so confusing.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.780]   It just, it doesn't make any sense as a consumer.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.220]   When you're looking at it, you're like, where am I sitting?
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:53.660]   What am I saying?
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.340]   What am I paying for?
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.460]   How do I upgrade into this?
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.940]   It's just too much.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.380]   So I like to think of it this way.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.980]   Whenever you're flying internationally, ideally transoceanically, there is going
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:07.820]   to be a premium economy cabin, a separate cabin with fancier seats.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.100]   They're not lie flat.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.820]   It's not a business class, but it might feel like a domestic business
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.540]   class on a lazy boy kind of seat, right?
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:19.100]   You've got a little more recline, a little more leg room on the United flights.
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.060]   It's usually a two, three, two seating.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.700]   Whereas an economy in the back, it's three, four, three, or three,
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.300]   three, three, very crowded.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.220]   You feel more spacious up there.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.660]   There's a better premium version of food.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.140]   You earn more miles for those seats, et cetera.
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.420]   So there is a separate cabin for that.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.820]   Again, it's not going to be seen outside of a couple of domestic routes where
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.180]   they're flying those bigger craft to reposition them.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.820]   It's not going to be seen domestically.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:46.260]   Now, confusingly, they will market domestically.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.260]   Sometimes their economy plus seating as premium economy.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.180]   Delta is notorious for this.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.300]   When you fly from JFK to San Francisco, they will market what they call Delta
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.420]   comfort, which is their economy plus as a premium economy cabin.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.620]   It's not, it's still just an economy seat with a little bit extra legroom.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.620]   So we're talking literally about two very separate cabins,
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.700]   very separate experiences.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.700]   As of right now, the airlines haven't really figured out how to optimize their
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.420]   mileage game when it comes to redemption for those premium plus the actual cabin.
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.900]   Premium economy seats.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.580]   So what I would always recommend is looking to upgrade into them, book
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.700]   an economy ticket and see what the mileage upgrade costs would be to
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.820]   actually upgrade into that premium cabin.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.060]   It's often fairly affordable.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.380]   United sometimes charges 10 or 20 plus points per leg.
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.980]   If you have those plus points, whereas other airlines, the
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.220]   price differential is so high.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.980]   It's almost like a mid tier between economy and business class when you pay
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.180]   for it, but when you actually use mileage to upgrade, it's not that expensive.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.100]   Okay.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.180]   And one thing we didn't mention for anyone using miles to travel internationally,
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.820]   a important thing to remember if you've never flown business class.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.780]   Internationally, then there are two things that are interesting.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:02.060]   One, the trans oceanic flight is going to be a next level experience.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.380]   I almost say, make sure that you have enough points to do it again.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.620]   Cause if you just do it once, you're going to want to do it every time.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.060]   The small short routes are awful.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.780]   They're terrible.
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:12.140]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:15.260]   Intra European business class is not business class.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:19.340]   When we went to Greece last year, we were like, Oh, we found seats.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.740]   It was business class the whole way.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.380]   And we were on air France and from San Francisco to Paris lie flatbed.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.060]   Wonderful service.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.140]   We get on the flight from Paris to Crete in Greece.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:34.420]   It's basically the first two rows of an economy flight with the exact same
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.140]   seats and they block off the middle seat.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:41.580]   And I would say if you're trying to move around Europe and you want to feel fancy,
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:46.860]   unless you're sure the plane you're on is a real business class plane, I would not
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:52.580]   ever use your miles to fly business class, intra Europe, maybe even intra Asia.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.460]   I'm not sure if it's the same there, but definitely intra Europe.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.220]   Absolutely.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:00.820]   And it's always useful to check whenever you're doing those shorter hops, what
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.220]   airline is operating the flight?
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.100]   What aircraft are they actually operating that flight on?
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.580]   And what are the seat maps look like?
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:10.700]   Because if you're flying from Tokyo to Sapporo in Japan, that's an hour and a
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.820]   half flight, they're actually going to put a triple seven with lie flat seats
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.900]   on that domestic small hop.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.180]   And it's a great experience, right?
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.740]   And you can use lounges and it's wonderful.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.340]   In Europe, it's the opposite.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.060]   You could fly three hours and it could be in a little crappy 737 and they're
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.340]   giving you like a hot piece of pizza for lunch.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.060]   It's sad.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.980]   So make sure you're using your miles and points correctly.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.060]   And then seat guru, great site.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.540]   You can go look at all the seat maps.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.940]   They usually say, yeah, this is just a regular seat with the
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.020]   middle seat blocked off.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.260]   So that's flights.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.620]   We hit a lot of stuff.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:44.620]   I want to talk about hotels because I feel like there's a lot more
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.860]   mystery here a little bit.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.260]   Everyone knows first class, they walk by it on the plane, but you don't always
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.060]   walk through the high end resorts.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.260]   In my opinion, it's a little harder.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.460]   It's not here are the business class flights.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.540]   Here are the coach flights.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.420]   There's a giant spectrum of resorts and hotels.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.620]   And I used to think five star was the top.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.020]   And then that hotel in Dubai started saying, no, no, no.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.780]   We are a seven star hotel.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.460]   What does that even mean?
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:06.900]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.100]   What is the high end of luxury hotels look like?
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.460]   And maybe just to start what sets apart, whatever category you call them, whether
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.940]   you call them five star or just high end, like what sets them apart from all the
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:18.660]   other hotels?
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.700]   Well, there's a couple of things that set them apart, right?
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.940]   One from the very face of it is price, right?
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.820]   What can you charge and get away with charging for that room?
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:31.460]   And what we've seen very much like we've seen in the private aviation sector is
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.340]   that on the hotel side, rates have gone through the roof over the last two years.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:40.940]   And especially on the higher end of the five star properties, it's incredible what
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.820]   some of these properties are charging, which then begs the question, is it worth
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.060]   it?
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:49.260]   So that comes to point number two, which is distinguishing factor of service, right?
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:54.340]   Are you getting the service level that five star or that price tag demands?
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.660]   That is an issue right now.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:01.020]   And I will say globally service for hotels has been troublesome.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.540]   We had a client recently in the Middle East at one of those five or seven star
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:08.140]   hotels, and we couldn't get ahold of the concierge for almost a day.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:13.820]   That's unacceptable for a global brand where somebody spending thousands of
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:19.380]   dollars a night for a room, price, service, location, all distinguish in when you
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.820]   create this five star atmosphere.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.140]   But the fourth thing is what are the amenities that are on the offer at that
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.420]   hotel that make them truly stand out?
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.300]   A minute ago, we talked about VIP access at airports.
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.780]   A lot of the Parisian five star hotels will actually, as part of the amenities
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.460]   that you get when you book with them, they'll actually bundle in an arrival
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.220]   greeter that will pick you up plain side and bring you through customs immigration
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.060]   to one of their cars waiting for you to whisk you to the hotel.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.580]   And it's a seamless experience.
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:51.220]   So that's why when we talked on our first chat, we chatted about how important it is
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:55.260]   to let the hotel know your travel plans, who you are, what you're coming to do,
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.340]   what experiences you want to have, your arrival and departure details, right?
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.780]   Because they're actually going to customize as part of their package that
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.740]   they're selling you, your arrival and departure with them.
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:06.740]   That's incredible.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:11.100]   So a five star hotel, in my opinion, provides exceptional service at an
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.700]   attractive price, and I want to say affordable, because that's out the window
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:21.060]   now, and they do it at a great location where the amenities are so rich and
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.340]   wonderful that make them stand out from the rest of their competitors in that field.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.100]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:35.420]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes,
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.620]   deals, and discounts from our partners.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.900]   You can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.300]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.940]   So let's get a little bit more tangible.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:51.340]   If we're going to look at two properties anywhere, let's say resorts in Mexico,
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.780]   four and five star, it might be three or four times more to stay at the higher end
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.420]   resort. What does that get you?
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.740]   That's a great question.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.300]   And hopefully the Delta is not three or four times between a four and a five
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.460]   star, but sometimes it is.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:07.020]   I would say that at a five star, you're looking at a less crowded restaurants
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.900]   and you're looking at maybe a larger room, a more responsive concierge.
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:15.220]   There might be more onsite amenities, more pools, an adult only pool, perhaps,
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:19.220]   or a family pool or something else that sets them apart amenity wise.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.660]   You might be looking at more personalized service.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.420]   Do you have a butler or do you have a team of concierges that are attached to
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.100]   your type of villa product or your room product?
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.700]   Now, going back to my comment earlier, unfortunately, service has been an issue
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.580]   for and five star properties globally lately.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:39.740]   So you may stay at a five star and you might be really excited about the splurge
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.060]   of this bucket list experience.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.900]   We've put all of our points into this say, and you might be underwhelmed by
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.740]   service. That's not necessarily a reflection accurately of the star rating
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.860]   right now. It's a reflection of the global atmosphere for service.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.900]   And hopefully we're going to get out of that this year.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.260]   But it's been a little interesting out there.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.980]   So again, coming back to my initial point, the more you can share with a hotel
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.900]   ahead of time, especially a five star hotel, to allow them to really customize
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.900]   that experience for you, they'll knock it out of the park with the data that you
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:09.220]   give them.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.020]   Cool. I've learned recently.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.700]   So when we were going to Bora Bora, I was like, okay, to me, the Conrad, the St.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.860]   Regis, the Four Seasons, those are the kind of high end resorts, the nicest
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.820]   things. I've recently learned that there is even a tier above that, that I didn't
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:29.460]   know a lot about. In French Polynesia, the hotel I put there, I learned about was
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.420]   the Brando. It's much more expensive.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.580]   I would say it definitely is three or four times the price.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:39.260]   And then I've learned that there's a whole chain of Amman resorts, and they are
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.700]   similarly much, much more expensive.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.940]   And so what do you call them?
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:48.060]   There has to be some way to differentiate a five star St.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:54.380]   Regis, Ritz Carlton, Conrad from an Amman or the Brando, or I'm sure there's
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.500]   other examples you have.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.340]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.300]   I mean, they're all are still five star, but there are these ultra luxury resorts
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.700]   that have their own sort of special categorization that are unique, singular
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.460]   destinations.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.860]   The Brando is a great example.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.740]   For those who don't know, the Brando is its own private island owned by the
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.580]   Brando family, as in Marlon Brando.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.100]   It's right north of Papeete in Tahiti.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.660]   And what sets it apart is that it's an eco resort, but it's super luxe.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:24.300]   So, you know, you would go traditionally to a normal five star over the water
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.660]   bungalow experience like the St.
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:29.940]   Regis and Bora Bora and have that perfect Instagram photo sort of vacation.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:32.380]   The Brando is a little more experiential.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.940]   There's no over water bungalows.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.740]   It's more villas on a private beach, but very secluded and very customized to you.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:43.620]   So again, back to my point earlier, you bring this super long questionnaire to
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.500]   the Brando where they ask you all your likes and dislikes, even down to which
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.420]   alcohol brands do you like, because they want to make sure that in your all
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.100]   inclusive mini bar, they've stocked that.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.100]   I said to them, for instance, I love champagne.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.780]   My wife doesn't.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.260]   So they put, instead of full bottles of champagne, half bottles.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.860]   And that was a really nice touch because they knew that my wife wasn't going to be
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.500]   drinking and I didn't want to get knockered off of one bottle, full bottle of
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.340]   champagne, that level of attention to detail sets them apart.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.060]   The level of amenities they offer sets them apart.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.620]   And when you look at Amman's or Rosewood's or some of these other ultra
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:18.460]   high end luxury properties around the world, they're singular destinations
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.660]   that are a truly a sense of place.
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.780]   It's not just an overwater experience with a pretty backdrop, but it's the
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:29.340]   essence of that property or of that destination that sets that hotel apart.
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:34.140]   It's villas built into a cliffside or it's villas built over in an eco-friendly
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.900]   manner over a mangrove reef.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.300]   And you're like, wow, this is incredible.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.500]   And there's no place in the world I could stay like this.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.660]   And it comes with a price tag, of course.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.420]   And it comes with incredible amenities that you won't get elsewhere because
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.060]   of what is offered there.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.700]   So it's a truly once, not in a lifetime for some people, but once
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.860]   ever experience for most of us.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:59.380]   For me, I've been in an Amman resort, but I have not stayed in an Amman resort.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.380]   I also noticed something.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.620]   None of these have loyalty programs.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:04.100]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.300]   You don't earn points.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.740]   You don't redeem with points.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.620]   Do people that have a lot of money that stay at really high end
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.300]   properties, is that not a factor?
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.140]   Why are there no loyalty programs?
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.180]   I'm mostly speaking because I wish that they're working so I can have these
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:16.980]   experiences.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.140]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.380]   I mean, they are so aspirational for those of us who aren't necessarily dropping
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.940]   $5,000 a night on a hotel room.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.300]   I would say this, there are loyalty programs there.
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.100]   You just don't know about them.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.780]   The Mandarin Oriental, one of my favorite hotel chains in the entire world, they
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:33.340]   only have two dozen properties globally and they're exceptional in every single
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:33.940]   location.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:38.060]   They know everything they need to know about you, which is one of the purposes
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:38.940]   of a loyalty program.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:43.420]   But yeah, you don't have points on a Mandarin card, but they do know when you
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.780]   ordered a drink at the Bangkok bar and then you go to London two weeks later,
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.740]   they're like, Oh, Mr.
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.220]   Hutchins, would you like that same drink with the Bombay Sapphire?
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:56.820]   And that is like skin crawlingly amazing for like the data to work that way, to
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.540]   make your experience so customized and wonderful.
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:04.180]   An example on that, in fact, not to do with loyalty, but to do with data is I
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.020]   stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.820]   And at the time I had an 18 month old child, he needed milk in the middle of
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.660]   the night and he needed to stretch his legs.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.700]   He was just antsy.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.340]   So I took him out of the room.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.580]   My butler saw that my door was open and said, Mr.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.660]   Rowan, how do we help you?
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.180]   And I said, we're good.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:19.900]   Thank you so much.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.300]   We're just going to go out and stretch our legs and go get some milk.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.700]   We're going to leave the property.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.580]   It's one 30 in the morning.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.020]   They're like, Oh sir, we've got milk here.
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.380]   And I was like, it's not the milk.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.180]   He just needs to like stretch his wings.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:35.980]   So there were 11 people that helped me between my room, the elevator,
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.380]   the lobby, the front desk, and leaving that room.
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.580]   And when I came back, they're like, Oh, did you get milk?
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:42.540]   Is there anything else you need?
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.380]   How do we help you?
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:48.420]   When I say to the Mandarin Oriental in London years later, they said, Oh, we
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.060]   remember a story about you getting milk, Jeremy.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.220]   And I'm like blown away that years later they would connect the dots.
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.500]   So that builds loyalty in me for sure.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.580]   I will talk about that story all the time.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.180]   And I will say the Mandarin Oriental knows how to deal with data and knows
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:05.380]   how to take care of people and knows how to show what it truly means to be a guest.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.940]   Do I earn points every time I stay there?
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.700]   Yeah, I use the right credit card, but I don't earn a loyalty
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.180]   program points with them.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.980]   And that's the kind of loyalty they're trying to build.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:17.540]   I've had a glimpse of some of that in four seasons.
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.340]   We were fortunate to stay the four seasons in Bali and every
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:21.380]   morning they remembered.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.460]   I love jackfruit for anyone who's never had a jackfruit.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:29.180]   I describe it as if a banana and a pineapple created a fruit child, very
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.420]   weird looking for a child, a very good looking fruit child and do not mistake
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.260]   for a durian because very different fruit and every morning they were like,
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.060]   Oh, do you want some jackfruit?
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.660]   I know it's not in the regular fruit tray, but even if it was a different
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.340]   waiter, we knew you had it yesterday morning, you asked for it, but I've
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.500]   never gotten to that next crazy level.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.180]   So here's an interesting, different version of that.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.900]   The four seasons also has this thing called the glitch report where every
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.660]   day, if there was an issue, let's say your toilet didn't flush.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:55.060]   Okay.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.140]   Everyone in the resort would know that you had an issue and that they are
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.660]   singularly focused on fixing that problem.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.580]   It doesn't mean that the housekeeper is going to be in your like room the
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.020]   whole day fixing your toilet.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.620]   It just means that the, the pool attendant might be like, Hey, Mr.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.020]   Hutchins, is there anything we can get for you?
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:11.540]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.380]   You had a rough night last night.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.340]   That's incredible, right?
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:18.220]   That builds loyalty in a way that points and miles maybe won't ever, because
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.100]   when was the last time that Delta really thank you for your business, Mr.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.540]   Hutchins, they're just reading off a sheet.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.620]   They don't know that you just came from Cleveland and you're tired.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.660]   You know, they don't know any of that.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:30.460]   So that level of loyalty is something that all hotels should aspire to.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:30.940]   In my opinion.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.700]   I look forward to a successful life that affords more of them.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.820]   Or for people listening, they might not know that because Lee works in the
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:44.300]   industry, I think one of the perks that you're afforded is because you make a
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:45.780]   lot of recommendations to clients.
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.580]   Hotels often give you a good deal.
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.300]   If anyone listening is wondering how to hack it, the other options
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.340]   to just work in the industry.
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.300]   Come join our industry.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.580]   We need good people.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.180]   And trust me, we're always hiring.
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:57.260]   A lot of people I know love to stay at Airbnbs.
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.900]   I'm not saying there aren't high-end luxury properties on Airbnb.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:00.980]   There definitely are.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:08.060]   But is there another level of the villa or home rental market that someone like
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.380]   me or anyone listening just has never heard of?
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.180]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:16.900]   So I like to use VRBO and Airbnb as a really good search engine barometer of
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:21.260]   where I should be putting people in homes in certain areas, because it tends to
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.060]   give me some good feedback on a market that I may not know.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:28.100]   The downside is that the quality level stops at that maybe four, four and a half
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.900]   star tier property and just get stuck there.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.500]   And if you've got a client with seven star expectations and the need for
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.660]   something a little larger, bigger, whatever, then you've got to turn elsewhere.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:42.700]   So there are a number of higher end search tools that we can use to source
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.380]   homes and villas, just like the ones you're mentioning, right?
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:50.180]   These super high-end luxury villa properties that have multiple bedrooms,
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.220]   incredible kitchens, staff, all of that stuff.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.220]   Over time, you kind of understand who the players are in each market, and
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.820]   it really is hyper-regionalized.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:02.260]   There is a Mexico player that has great villas all throughout Mexico, but then
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.260]   there was one in Punta Mita that I would use specifically when I'm traveling
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.820]   there and looking for properties there.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.540]   What are you expecting out of these places?
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.660]   Number one, you're going to be signing a contract that signs your life away.
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:15.660]   You're going to be wiring money to some bank account somewhere as a deposit, and
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.940]   then 30 or 60 days out wiring the rest.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.140]   There's big, hefty security deposits.
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:24.500]   I just saw for the first time ever a quarter million dollar security deposit
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:28.460]   on a villa that we're renting for someone and my eyes, I'm sorry, what?
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.740]   Not 25,000?
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:33.180]   So you're looking at big contracts, big security deposits, but they come
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.580]   with these incredible amenities.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.780]   Some of these houses that we've rented for people come with a staff of 30.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.420]   You know, you have your own Michelin starred chef that will
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.580]   cook you whatever you want.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.820]   And again, pre-ordering and telling them the details ahead of time.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:45.820]   This person's a vegetarian.
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.060]   They only eat fish, undercook the beef for him.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.620]   That's super important because they're going to customize
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.820]   that experience to that stay.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.420]   But they're just what you would expect from those TV shows, The Lifestyle,
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.620]   The Rich and Famous or Cribs.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:59.740]   They're just these over the top homes that have the best view of Aspen, or
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:04.220]   you have the most incredible private beach in Malibu, or you've got your own
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:07.180]   nine acres of riverfront property in Montana where you can catch your own fish.
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.140]   I just incredible properties like that.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.780]   If someone listening is like, I just want to go look at a few pictures.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.580]   It doesn't have to be a site that covers everything, but is there a place that
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.540]   just has a few of these that you can go look at?
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.060]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:22.060]   One I like the most for domestic properties is called Cuvee, C-U-V-E-E.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.420]   They're based out of Colorado.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:24.780]   They've got beautiful properties.
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.180]   And some of those, including the one in Aspen, I mentioned,
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.100]   anybody can book these.
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.740]   You don't need to have a special in or connection, but they're incredible.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.740]   They're vacation homes of a lifetime.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.620]   And they can actually make sense economically.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.620]   If you have a big enough group and you're looking for something
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.180]   that's a bucket list experience, it's not always much more than
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.860]   getting rooms or suites at a hotel.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:44.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.340]   There's a house, feel free to Google it.
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.260]   It's called Villa Turquesa and it's in Cabo.
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.580]   And we've been there for a handful of bachelor parties.
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:57.340]   And it actually ended up being reasonable, especially my villa
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.620]   hack for this is if you're going with a group of people, divide
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:04.340]   the rooms up in a way that lets the friends of yours that have
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.660]   the money that want a little nicer, get something else.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:10.140]   So this particular house, if you look it up, has four bedrooms
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:13.700]   with a king bed, four bedrooms with two queen beds, and one
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.340]   room with 12 bunk beds.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:20.140]   And so we priced it such that if you want your own room with your
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.900]   own bed, you pay a lot more.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.500]   And if you want your own bed that you only have to share with
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.900]   one person, you pay more.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.700]   And if you're okay, being one of the 12 people in the bunk
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.260]   bedroom, you get a great deal.
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.100]   And you'll have a hell of a party.
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.700]   It's a fantastic house.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.940]   There there's a chef named Lorenzo in the house, cooks,
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.740]   whatever you want, but it ended up working out with a group of
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:43.660]   20 people to be maybe a thousand dollars per person.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.780]   And that included enough money for all the food for maybe five
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:48.140]   days.
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:49.620]   So it's incredible.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:50.260]   It's a great deal.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.100]   I want to say that also included all of our transportation.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.860]   Whenever I would plan a trip like this, I would try to come
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.780]   up with a dollar figure that would cover all the shuttles,
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:48:59.780]   all the activities.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.020]   One day we're going to rent a boat.
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.060]   One day we're going to do this.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.340]   And the hack for me was I would plan a trip for 20 people.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.940]   I'd put the entire villa for five nights on my credit card.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.740]   I'd book the flights for all 20 people going down.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.460]   I would, obviously there's a little risk.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.940]   The one person who doesn't pay back.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.020]   Fortunately, if you ever book group flights, if you call the
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.780]   airline and you actually go to the group desk, they usually
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.180]   give you the wiggle room to drop one or two people in a group
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.260]   before the, or change the name or do something.
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:24.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.820]   And so that's both how I accumulated a lot of points and
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:31.740]   found that for the right group with enough people, it can work
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.260]   really well.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:32.740]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.900]   If you want to go to this house and you don't have kids and
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.100]   you're not going to use the bunk bedroom, then it's going to
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.220]   sleep a whole lot less people.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.060]   It might only be eight couples and that might be much less
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.180]   affordable, but it is possible.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.900]   I think it's a really cool experience to stay in a villa
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:49.460]   with a chef that can cook meals, especially, you know, in a
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:52.380]   time where you may be coming out of the pandemic, not ready to
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.620]   go to a super crowded resort.
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:54.140]   Sure.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.580]   I'll give you one further hack on that, which is that a place
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:59.820]   like Villa Turquesa is probably marketing itself in 25 different
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:00.380]   directions.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.540]   And so what you should do before you get to work with Villa
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:06.700]   Turquesa is Google it and figure out where are they marketing
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.780]   and what are the prices on each of these places and go back to
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.420]   Villa Turquesa directly and say, Hey, listen, I see your
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:13.860]   marketing over there for a little cheaper.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.380]   Or I see that somebody over here is costing even more money.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.140]   If I were to book that with them, I want to book directly
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.180]   with you, I want to pay the best available price.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.140]   What is that?
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:24.900]   All of those villa prices are slightly negotiable outside of
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:25.500]   peak periods.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.580]   So be sure to go directly to the ownership, not through an
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.300]   intermediary villa company and ask them, what are they willing
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.220]   to do if you book direct?
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:32.980]   I love that.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:36.100]   And in our first episode on the show, you mentioned if you can't
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:40.380]   find them, take an image, do a Google image search of the core
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.620]   image of the property, and you can usually find the other
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:44.380]   websites that image appears on.
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:47.660]   One last thing we didn't talk about with hotels is the kind of
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.460]   perks you get when you book them through a travel advisor.
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:52.300]   Anyone can book most of these properties.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.340]   You want to book a Nauman, you want to book a Four Seasons or
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.860]   a St. Regis, you can go on the website.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.140]   But when you book through someone who has a relationship
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.900]   with these brands and properties, like you do at tons of
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:05.020]   these resorts, you end up getting amenities that I talked
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.820]   about a few weeks back, this kind of hotel experiment that
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.980]   we're working on with all the hacks, where you might get an
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:15.020]   upgrade, free breakfast, a property credit, late checkout,
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.180]   an amenity in your room, because I got so many questions about
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.020]   that, I want to talk a little bit about how it works.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.180]   Generally, these hotels, my understanding is they want to
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:29.020]   extend perks to people who are related to clients that send
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.460]   lots of traffic or how does it work?
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.580]   Yeah, it's exactly right.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.340]   There are a couple of ways of getting these outsized perks at
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:34.780]   hotels.
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.500]   One of them is having a high tier in loyalty, right?
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.180]   Having Marriott ambassador status means that Marriott knows
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.340]   who you are when you stay at a Marriott property.
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.620]   And anybody at that property could tie into the Marriott
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.220]   database and look up Chris and say, Oh, wow, he's fancy pants.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.740]   He runs a great podcast, and he's a nice guy.
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:50.500]   Let's take care of him.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.620]   But that's where that sort of stops.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.340]   And it obviously stops with Marriott.
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:57.820]   If you have no high status, or if you've never stayed in an
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:58.980]   Amman, they don't know anything about you.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.660]   So the second way that hotels get a lot of their info and
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.700]   therefore assign a lot of perks is through this travel advisor
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.420]   relationship.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.980]   And that relationship is actually probably the strongest
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:12.900]   sales channel for hotels, because it develops a quality
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:13.340]   guest.
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.180]   It says, Hey, this is who Chris Hutchins is, whether he stays
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:18.980]   in a Marriott, a Hyatt, an Amman, a Rosewood or whatever.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:19.860]   This is who he is.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:20.820]   And this is what he wants.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.420]   And this is what his experience should be.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.940]   Can you help craft this and a good hotel, a four or five star
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.900]   hotel will absolutely do that.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.260]   And in exchange for that, they'll give perks.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:33.220]   They'll say, look, we want Chris to come stay here, spend his
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:33.660]   money here.
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.340]   So we were going to give him daily breakfast and we're going
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:38.020]   to guarantee an upgrade for him at booking.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.420]   And we're going to make sure that every morning when we run
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:43.820]   our arrivals report of who's coming in that day, we flag him
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:48.140]   as a VIP and say, Chris needs this, or let's give Chris's room
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:48.540]   assignment.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.420]   Let's give it an even better upgrade or a better view just
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:52.700]   because he came in through this channel.
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.060]   And we know things about him that we wouldn't know if Chris
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:55.780]   just booked online.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.220]   So it's rate parody there.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.060]   They're never going to give you like a crazier rate for seasons
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:03.580]   doesn't discount, right?
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.620]   But they are going to give you a better experience by knowing
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.740]   the channel through which you came.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.380]   So you mentioned earlier that right now, this is mostly a
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.660]   channel restricted to travel advisors, or if you have an
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.220]   annex platinum card or you have some other way of getting a
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:20.420]   perk program, we're trying to democratize that, especially
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.020]   for all the hacks, listeners, a special way of getting that
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.020]   access, a sort of a self-serve model.
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.860]   So more on that coming soon.
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:31.460]   But the big takeaway from that is that the more a hotel knows
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.500]   about you, the better the experience will be.
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.900]   And they're willing to give you perks for that.
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:39.300]   They're willing to say, Hey, be part of this program as you
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.940]   book, give us some information on how we can make your stay
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.860]   special so that you're going to spend money here.
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.420]   And you're going to come back here and you're going to tell
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.460]   all your friends about what a wonderful experience it was.
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:48.620]   Here's some more perks.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.420]   So if you're listening, that's a little bit more about the how
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:54.860]   and the why behind this kind of hotel perks and benefits
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.820]   experiment I mentioned, shoot us an email.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:00.020]   The email I made was getupgraded@allthehacks.com.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:03.020]   And the caveats, just because I've gotten a lot of questions
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:04.620]   has to be a paid booking.
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.380]   Unfortunately, a lot of these perks don't apply or none of
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:11.140]   them apply to awards days, and it has to be booked through
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:12.260]   our relationship.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.060]   So if you haven't booked yet and you want to get some of
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:18.540]   these premium perks at probably almost 4,000 hotels around
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.220]   the world, shoot us an email.
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.620]   I'll put the link in the show notes.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.820]   Just let us know where you're going, rough budget, and when
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.100]   you're going, and we'll see if we can help get you hooked up.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:30.700]   Last topic I wanted to go on was little tricks and tips when
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.140]   you are there that don't have to do with booking, don't have
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:34.060]   to do with flying.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.900]   One I want to ask first is around tipping.
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:42.220]   What is the practical advice around tipping, not for daily
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:44.820]   housekeeping, but to enhance an experience?
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.860]   I watched Inventing Anna or Anna, or however you want to
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:48.580]   pronounce her name.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:51.020]   And she was handing out a hundred dollar bills around the
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:51.660]   hotel.
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:55.900]   And it just made me think, is there a benefit to giving a tip
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:00.100]   to the concierge or the person checking you in in Vegas or the
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:02.220]   person at the front desk of a restaurant?
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.660]   When is there not right?
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:07.300]   If you have the means to do it, then absolutely I would do it.
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:09.140]   And I wouldn't always limit it to this money.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:12.100]   So let's use the concierge and let's just say Paris, for
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.340]   example, there are a couple of different ways of taking care of
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.140]   that concierge.
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.660]   Number one, if you have developed via email, a
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:21.500]   relationship with a particular concierge before you arrive, one
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.420]   of the things you can do is write a note to the general
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.220]   manager and say, Hey, Laurent has been amazing.
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:28.060]   I just want you to know, I'm so looking forward to my trip
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.420]   because Laurent has already dialed in all these experiences
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:30.740]   for me.
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.660]   Thank you for employing somebody like Laurent.
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:37.420]   And that non-monetary bit of time that you just spent taking
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.500]   care of Laurent will go so far in making your experience even
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:41.420]   better before you get there.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.220]   So that's number one.
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:46.140]   Number two is, yeah, bring them a gift, bring them some little
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:47.740]   goodie and to say, thank you.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:52.540]   So that might mean that you buy la durée macaroon the moment you
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:55.580]   arrive at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport and you have your VIP
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.980]   greeter stop you for a second to buy them, buy them a little
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.820]   treat, a little token of appreciation there, or even bring
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.300]   it from home.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:04.140]   Bring them Ghirardelli chocolate from California, not the best
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.500]   chocolate in the world, but it's something from San Francisco.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.300]   It's cool.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:10.340]   It ties you to a place and it shows this intention of thank
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:11.020]   you of gratitude.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:11.380]   Right.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.860]   And then of course, give them money.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:16.500]   I like to tip concierges at the beginning of a stay, which will
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.380]   always help ensure wonderful service.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.700]   And then at the very end of a stay, if they've gone above and
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.700]   beyond again, I would give them something.
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:23.900]   What are you giving them?
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:24.980]   It's really up to you.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:25.940]   There is no guide.
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:29.220]   I was talking with a hotelier in Paris actually, and he said to
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:32.700]   me, we've got some clients who tip a 20 euro a day and they give
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:33.180]   it at the front.
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.020]   And if the concierge has gone above and beyond while they're
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.020]   there, they give them a little bit more at the end, another 20
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:38.660]   or 50 euro.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:41.660]   I know one guy who just tips a thousand dollars for wherever he
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:42.540]   goes when he gets there.
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:43.940]   Cause he can do that good for him.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.220]   Trust me, his service is exceptional, right?
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:49.460]   So it really depends on what you want to do, but any token of
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.580]   gratitude and appreciation is always appreciated, including
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.980]   just a simple email before and after the stay saying, Hey, you
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:56.460]   did a great job.
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:56.820]   Thank you.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.260]   Can tipping ever unlock something?
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:03.700]   Can you walk into a restaurant and say, tip the hostess and get
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.380]   a table that you wouldn't otherwise gotten?
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.660]   Or I've often heard tipping the person checking you in, in
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.180]   Vegas, gets you a nicer room.
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:10.500]   Right.
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.020]   Have you had experience with those things?
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:12.220]   Yeah.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.820]   I think in certain places it absolutely works.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:18.100]   In Vegas, in Italy, in Paris, it can go a long way.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.540]   In Frankfurt or Zurich, I don't know if you're going to get the
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.980]   same reaction by tipping somebody 20 francs or euro.
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.100]   It just depends on what the local custom is.
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.860]   In Japan, that might seem very odd to receive a tip at check-in from
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.500]   someone, but if you wrote them a lovely note and handed it to them
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.260]   with two hands at check-in, that might be a different story and
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:35.220]   accompany that with a gift.
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:38.700]   So really, yes, the answer is it can unlock experiences for you.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:39.260]   For sure.
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:42.180]   It has to be culturally appropriate to the market that you're in.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:45.060]   And if you have questions about that, look online and look ahead
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:48.020]   of time and say like tipping concierge or tipping at check-in
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:48.940]   and seeing what will happen.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:52.580]   What won't work is you're not going to get an upgrade if you
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.060]   give a flight attendant 20 bucks.
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:55.940]   You're not, they're going to be pissed at you.
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.180]   The same thing with a gate agent at an airport, right?
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.380]   Those things don't work.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:02.540]   You can, which I've done, absolutely bring flight
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:05.460]   attendants chocolate and say, Hey, I know how hard you're working.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:05.980]   Thank you.
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:07.700]   And watch what the service you get is.
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:08.380]   It's exceptional.
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.380]   No matter what a cabin of service you're in.
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:15.100]   The follow-up question naturally is, is there anything you can do to
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:19.020]   get an upgrade on a flight for free without using your points and miles?
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.020]   It sounds like the answer is no.
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:25.060]   I have no recommendable options other than enhancing your on flight
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.700]   service experience by bringing gifts for the flight attendants.
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:29.980]   I love doing that anyway, because they're some of the hardest
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:31.580]   working people in hospitality.
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:32.420]   That's a crazy job.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.780]   And think about how many crazy people are yelling at them at all times.
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.860]   Take care of them, bring them treats, bring them chocolates.
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.460]   Just even just saying, thank you.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:44.700]   Some loyalty programs will give certain status members, like these
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:47.660]   little like certificates that you can then give away to a flight
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:48.700]   attendant to say, Hey, thank you.
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:49.380]   Did a great job.
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:52.220]   And I've actually written in to request more from American
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:53.340]   Airlines and they've sent them to me.
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:57.460]   So that's also useful to know is that American United, they used
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:58.980]   to Delta for a little while.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:02.020]   They used to give you these certificates, ask your loyalty program.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:06.140]   If they have anything that you can use to reward their staff, they might just
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.980]   direct you to some online form, which is worthless.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.420]   If they have a physical thing you can give away that, that goes, that goes miles.
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:12.180]   All right.
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:15.780]   Last thing is about organizing stuff on the ground.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:20.100]   I know we talked on this in our first episode, but if we're focused on the
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:23.900]   higher end, are there concierge services?
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.180]   Is it the hotel?
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:30.420]   Is it things like quintessentially that can unlock stuff or are most of these
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:36.060]   services more about saving you the time and energy of organizing than actual access?
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:37.260]   All of the above.
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:38.980]   So it depends on the experience you want to have.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.140]   And I'll give you an example.
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:44.020]   If you want to go to the Formula One track in Monza in Italy.
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:44.580]   Okay.
[00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.740]   There are multiple ways of going about that, right?
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:52.020]   You can go to the Formula One track and find out, Hey, how do I get access here?
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.820]   And if they say to you, Oh, sorry, it's private only, or you can't, you're a
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.260]   schlub or whatever it is, then you look at step B.
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.500]   Well, who sells just access to that?
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.860]   Is there a racing club?
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:06.060]   Is there a Formula One focused tourism experience that I could look at
[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.460]   where I could buy access that way?
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.740]   What hotel are you staying at?
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.660]   Can you ask them?
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.020]   And can you see what they can do?
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.860]   Do they recommend not working with the concierge, but working with a local
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.940]   ticket provider or something else, right?
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:16.740]   Yes.
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:20.020]   You can go to a DMC that oversees a region.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.900]   And they might look at all of Northern Italy, or they might be responsible
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:26.300]   for all of Italy and say to them, Hey, listen, I want to do this experience
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.380]   in Monza, but I also want to go to this restaurant and this, and they can help
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.580]   you put together that whole experience.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:33.660]   Or it might be something that is so hyper-focused that you would want to
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:37.220]   use a service like a quintessentially, where they're putting together an entire
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.580]   trip for you based around one experience.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.780]   I want to go golfing at St.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.260]   Andrew's.
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.620]   I want to do the racetrack.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.620]   I want to do driving here.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.340]   I want to do whatever.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.900]   And then they literally craft a trip around that.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.820]   Whether it's a travel designer or a membership club like quintessentially,
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:54.060]   I would recommend looking at that to see who can help you build that rounded trip
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.860]   with the guarantee of access to the key thing it is that you want.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.460]   But I would always first start with what is that service?
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.260]   What is that place I want to go?
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.740]   And is there a way of cutting out all the middlemen first, directly getting access?
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.660]   And if I can't do that, then keep going in the concentric circles thereafter.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.340]   I haven't used quintessentially or any of the other high-end concierge services.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.420]   They're quite expensive.
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.740]   Thousands of dollars a year.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:19.220]   I'm actually thinking maybe it would be a fun episode to bring someone on from
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.900]   them and just talk about where they add value, how that works.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:23.620]   So that's something we'll do in the future.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:26.380]   I think that's all I got for this episode right now.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.980]   I'm sure we're going to come up with more.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.780]   We'll have Lee back on a third time.
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:33.380]   Before we go, where can people stay in tune with what you're working on?
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:35.020]   My name is spelled in a funny way.
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:39.140]   It's L E I G H and last name Rowan, R O W A N.
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:44.260]   The company is Savanti travel, S A V A N T I travel.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.900]   Hit me up online.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.900]   I'm always here to be helpful however I can.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.140]   I'm so appreciative of the opportunity to see you again in this beautiful place and
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.260]   to check in again on these fun topics.
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:59.060]   And again, I'm giving you huge kudos on the millions of listeners you've had,
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:03.700]   the incredible success and these luminary guests of which I am just a mere peon.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:08.900]   Well, the advice you've given in our first episode to reach out to the hotel to get
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:13.900]   upgraded has easily been the most emailed topic I've gotten from any listener.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:17.100]   So many people have been upgraded because of it.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.460]   Shout out to one listener, Janie,
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.180]   who actually had her initials embroidered into a pillow.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.660]   That was so cool.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:24.580]   It was wild.
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:25.380]   So you know,
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:28.820]   your hacks in the first episode and this one will hook up hundreds of people.
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.180]   Thank you and hope to do it again soon.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.060]   Thank you so much, Chris.
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:35.580]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.980]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:41.540]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.660]   Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.460]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.660]   questions for me or just want to say hi,
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:51.780]   I'm Chris at AllTheHacks.com or @Hutchins on Twitter.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:53.060]   That's it for this week.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:53.980]   I'll see you next week.
