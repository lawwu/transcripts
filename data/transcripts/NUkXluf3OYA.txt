[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300]   The following is a conversation with Michael Malice.
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.320]   This is a special holiday episode,
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.540]   and it is made extra special
[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.040]   because it's announcing the release
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.880]   of Michael's new book called "The White Pill,
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.100]   A Tale of Good and Evil."
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.560]   Michael and I disagree on a lot of ideas
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.240]   in politics and philosophy,
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.040]   and we have a lot of fun disagreeing.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.560]   But there's no question that he has a deep love for humanity
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.920]   and puts his heart and soul into his work,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.400]   especially into this heart-wrenching, deeply personal book.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.680]   So I ask that you support him
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.720]   by buying it at whitepillbook.com.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.220]   That should hopefully forward to the Amazon page.
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.320]   As always, we each dressed up in a ridiculous outfit
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.000]   without coordinating for the chaos
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.080]   that makes life so damn interesting.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.520]   This episode is full of humor, darkness, and love,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.900]   which is the best way to celebrate the holidays.
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.880]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.840]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.160]   in the description.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.800]   And now, dear friends, here's Michael Malice.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.280]   We probably should have coordinated this better,
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.120]   shouldn't we? - Yeah.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.320]   - I think so.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.040]   Have you, since this is a Christmas special,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.200]   a holiday special, have you been a good
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.240]   or a bad boy, Michael, this year?
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.080]   - Well, that's interesting.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.880]   One of the people in the book, Granville Hicks,
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.660]   his autobiography starts with, "I was a good boy."
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.300]   And he wasn't a very good boy.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.560]   - On a scale of one to 10?
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.660]   - I'm trying to think of what bad things I've done.
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.620]   Oh, okay, there's that.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.380]   Okay, wait, that's not, that was, that was not a--
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.220]   - That's all right.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.100]   - I would say nine.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.500]   - Nine? - Yeah.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.300]   I try to do the right thing.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.900]   - Okay. - What about you?
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.040]   Is it gonna be a one or a zero?
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.940]   - Yeah, no, I'm extremely self-critical.
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.940]   I push the zero. - Okay.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.140]   - I reach for the zero.
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.640]   - Well, mission accomplished.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.080]   - So this episode is announcing the release
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.000]   of "The White Pill," a book you wrote,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.680]   which is, I've gotten the honor, the privilege,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.680]   the pleasure of being one of the first people to read it.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.200]   - So I'm really, I don't know if nervous is the word,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.800]   but you are the first person who has read it
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   that I am speaking to about it.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.560]   - My first, my last, my everything.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.400]   - Yes.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.760]   - You say that to all the girls, but I'll take it.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.720]   - All the fembots.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.920]   - All the fembots.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.660]   But yeah, it was a truly incredible book.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.020]   It's basically a story of evil in the 20th century,
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.020]   and throughout it, you reveal a thread that gives us hope.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.880]   And that's the idea of "The White Pill."
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.440]   So there's the blue pill and the red pill.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.280]   There's the black pill, which is a kind of deeply cynical,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.380]   maybe apathetic, just giving up on the world,
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.320]   given that you see behind the curtain,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.000]   and given that you don't like what you see,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.640]   given that there's so much suffering in the world,
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.120]   you give up, that's the black pill.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.920]   And the white pill, I suppose, is even though
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   you acknowledge that there's evil in the world,
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.160]   you don't give up.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.000]   - Yes.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.840]   - So if you're listening to this,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.240]   and you're a fan of this podcast--
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.360]   - You go to whitepillbook.com, it'll go to it.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.560]   - Whitepillbook.com, and if you don't know how to spell,
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.960]   we'll probably have a link that you can click on.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.720]   So for people who also don't know,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.280]   Michael Malice is not just a troll,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.960]   not just a hilarious, comedic genius
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.160]   who hosts his own podcast,
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.920]   but he is an incredible, brilliant author.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.240]   Dear Reader, the unauthorized autobiography, Kim Jong-il.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.080]   So that's a story of North Korea.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.560]   The New Right, A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.320]   That's the story of the extremes
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.600]   of the United States political movements,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.280]   and then the anarchist handbook
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.480]   that's talking about the ideologies,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.040]   the different flavors of ideologies of anarchism.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.240]   But on top of that, you're now going in,
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.680]   going into the darkest aspects of the 20th century
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.880]   with the Soviet Union and the communism with the white pill.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.480]   So let me ask you, let's start at the beginning.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.760]   At the end of the 19th century, as you write,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.800]   the terms socialist, communist, and anarchist
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.400]   were used somewhat loosely and interchangeably
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.760]   because the prophesied Marxist society
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.080]   was one in which the state had famously withered away.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.360]   There was a great disagreement
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.440]   about what a socialist system would look like in practice,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.840]   but two things were clear.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.960]   First, that socialism was both inevitable and scientific,
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.000]   the way of the future,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.200]   and second, that the capitalist ruling class
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.920]   were not going down without a fight.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.000]   So what are the key points of disagreement
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.800]   between the socialists, the anarchists, the communists
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.960]   along that, at that time?
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.640]   At the end of the 19th century,
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.840]   at the beginning of the 20th century,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.280]   the possibility of the century laid before us
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.240]   that eventually led to the first and the second World War.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.160]   - The idea when the Industrial Revolution came,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.200]   and Marx was very much a product
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.360]   of Industrial Revolutionary thinking,
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.600]   was, okay, now that we have technology,
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.720]   now that we have science,
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.280]   we can scientifically manage society.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.680]   We saw this very much with Woodrow Wilson
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.720]   and this kind of idea of progressivism
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.880]   that we could use technology and kind of not,
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.720]   capitalism, in their view, unfettered capitalism,
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.640]   was wasteful, you're making too much stuff,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.400]   you have surpluses, you have shortages.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.520]   If we produce just exactly what we need
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.160]   and you have these people, engineers,
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.600]   they're engineering society,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.200]   then everyone will be happy
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.680]   and you won't have to have any suffering or waste.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.600]   So socialism at that time was used as a broad umbrella.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.760]   It's not used in the term that it means today
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.520]   of necessarily state socialism.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.400]   It just meant the idea
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.120]   of having society scientifically run.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.680]   So you had a huge argument, there are different wings,
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.960]   you even had it from the beginning,
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.840]   with Marx versus Bakunin,
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.560]   'cause Marx was for, obviously, state socialism,
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.640]   the absolute state running everything.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.120]   Although even with Marx and Engels,
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.800]   it was a means to an end.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.720]   After man is remade in his very nature,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.560]   then the state withers away and everyone's equal
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.360]   and you have this kind of heaven on earth situation.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.080]   Bakunin was the opposite.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.560]   He regarded the state as inherently immoral
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.680]   and wanted to have kind of like workers' collectives
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.240]   and things like that and ultra-localized control.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.760]   - So the end was always stateless.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.880]   It's just that some people viewed the state
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.920]   as a convenient, effective intermediate state.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.760]   - Well, I think at least Marx and Bakunin,
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.320]   there were plenty of others who just regarded it,
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.600]   have the state owners, have the workers control
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.480]   the production via the state.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.040]   - By the way, how does my hat look?
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.600]   - It looks great, festive.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.480]   - It's good?
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.000]   Is this side better than the other side?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.640]   - I think you want it on this side so people can see you.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.480]   - Oh, no, no, no.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.320]   I want it.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.160]   You know like when you have like hair over your eye?
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.280]   - Peekaboo hair, it's called.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.680]   Veronica Lake, I think was her name.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.640]   - And then I just glance flirtatiously
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.120]   towards the camera sometimes.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.880]   I gotta, stay, don't go.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.720]   - Sure.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.240]   - Yeah, put on gloves.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.080]   - Oh, oh.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.680]   No glove, no love.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.440]   The bad aspect of white gloves is the blood stains them.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.920]   So you have to get new ones every time.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.120]   - And now I glance flirtatiously after that.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.160]   Okay, but we're gonna get into Marx.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.000]   Go ahead.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.480]   - So there were other socialists who did not regard
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.000]   this kind of end times where the state
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.240]   would do it their way at all.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.240]   And there were various strains in between
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.620]   where you'd have some capitalism and some socialism.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.440]   The concept of a safety net came out of socialist thinking
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.440]   in the Labor Party, came out of the Fabian socialists
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.760]   in Great Britain.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.720]   Their logo was a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.160]   And then when that was too on the nose,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.360]   they changed it to a tortoise,
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.120]   meaning we're gonna get to socialism slowly
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.560]   in the sense of either gradualism or boiling a frog.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.080]   And also the big part of this thinking at the time,
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.280]   this is again, the late 19th century,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.760]   is the idea that there's gonna be
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.800]   a worldwide workers' revolution.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.960]   It wasn't going to be that in one country,
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.680]   it was gonna happen and then all the other countries
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.520]   would be capitalists.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.080]   The idea was, all right, the workers in Germany
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.880]   have more in common with the workers in America
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.200]   than the workers in Germany have
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.400]   with the capitalists in Germany.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.760]   So the idea is, all right, the working class
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.040]   all over the world at one point,
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.800]   they're gonna be like, we're being exploited.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.160]   It's getting worse and worse for us.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.800]   We can't feed our families.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.440]   We're getting injured and so on and so forth.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.520]   And there's no compensation for this.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.040]   We're just gonna overthrow our chains
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.680]   and we're gonna run everything ourselves.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.180]   We're the ones running it already anyway.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.360]   And this was a-- - Doing all the work.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.360]   - And we're doing all the work.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.640]   So why shouldn't we be getting all the benefit?
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.080]   - What's the role of violence in all of this?
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.400]   - So this was a big source of contention.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.200]   So the Fabians, for example, in Britain,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.800]   who were all socialists, they were very heavily
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.220]   of the idea that we can do this through the ballot box.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.400]   We can advocate and agitate and get the people
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.440]   to be voting for their own self-interest
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.640]   and furthering the state at the expense
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.280]   of the capitalist class.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.160]   Then there were the people who were the hardcore anarchists
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.520]   who were like, if voting changed anything,
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.840]   they wouldn't let us do it.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.480]   And the only way to have a revolution
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.480]   is to have a revolution, to kill, to overthrow,
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.880]   to seize these factories.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.600]   And this was a big argument.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.060]   And it also fed into the idea of where does free speech end?
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.140]   Is it legal to be giving speeches,
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.760]   advocating for violence and revolution?
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.600]   Is it legal?
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.500]   Johann Most, who I discuss in the book,
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.980]   and in the "Anarchist Handbook,"
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.860]   he published a book in the 1800s
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.780]   about how to build dynamite and how to build bombs.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.360]   And this is a big free speech concern at the time
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.660]   because now anyone in their own house can make a bomb
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.900]   and kill lots of people.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.980]   And this is something that was happening
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.820]   with enormous frequency at the time.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.340]   And people tend to think,
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.300]   'cause we have these kind of prejudices,
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.220]   or we only remember what's happening now.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.020]   But this was, I mean, World War II,
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.700]   oh, excuse me, World War I got started
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.600]   with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.780]   There were lots of people,
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.600]   McKinley's another one who I discuss in the book,
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.820]   his assassination.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.500]   There was lots of violence happening very regularly.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.220]   And with the creation of dynamite,
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.860]   it kind of exponentially became more dangerous
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.700]   and threatening.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.300]   Even now on Wall Street,
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.980]   there was a bomb that went off, I think, in the 1920s.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.540]   And the shards of shrapnel are still
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.660]   in the JP Morgan building, I believe.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.260]   - Do you ever think, if you were alive during that time,
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.700]   what you would be doing?
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.860]   You think of yourself as an anarchist?
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.700]   - Right.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.900]   - Would you be, where would you be?
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.860]   Would you be a socialist, a communist?
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.140]   Which parties would you attend, figuratively and literally?
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.420]   - Well, the thing that was so interesting back then
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.780]   is there was a woman named Mabel Dodge Lujan,
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.860]   and she ended her days in Taos, New Mexico.
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.580]   She founded an artist colony.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.540]   And she had an apartment on 9th Street
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.180]   and 5th Avenue in Manhattan, a chateau salon.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.780]   And everyone got together and talked.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.300]   And you'd have Emma Goldman, who was an anarchist,
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.100]   Margaret Sanger, who invented Planned Parenthood
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.940]   and advocated for birth control.
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.580]   And you'd have the people from the Wobblies,
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.240]   the hardcore labor unions.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.980]   And everyone kind of, Ed Sheeran Mencken didn't attend,
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.580]   but he was friends with them all.
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.580]   So there was this very weird,
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.300]   with the birth of modernism in art
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.560]   and in kind of modernist thinking,
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.740]   there was this idea of like, all right,
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.140]   like this was the first time
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.500]   where you could be intellectual as a class,
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.820]   where there really was this space
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.220]   for people who are thinkers.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.100]   And they just sat around being like, all right,
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.580]   like, what are we gonna do with ourselves?
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.300]   And you had it in modern art, you had it in literature,
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.660]   you had it in politics.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.260]   So it was a very exciting time where people were like,
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.020]   all right, like everything is now on the table.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.180]   What are we gonna do with this?
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.300]   And they very much were aware that this was a break
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.980]   with the pre-industrial revolution
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.020]   kind of farmer labor era.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.000]   - Do you see, do you think for you,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.400]   violence would be compelling?
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.900]   - No, first of all, I'm just too small.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.080]   But second, I just--
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.080]   - Dynamite doesn't care about your size.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.940]   - Yeah, but I mean, retribution does.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.460]   And I think, I don't know,
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.780]   but to me, violence is the kind of thing
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.020]   where you think you're running it, but it's running you.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:28.020]   Once you cross that line, violence sings its own song.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.420]   So whenever I hear even contemporary times
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.300]   where people are advocating for violent actions,
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.220]   it's like, when you start a fire,
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.920]   you're not like, I'm just gonna burn down this house.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.820]   And there's many cases over and over
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.680]   of people who are building bombs
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.700]   or trying to assassinate someone or things like that.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.500]   And it ended up literally, literally, literally
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.260]   blowing up in their own face.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.260]   And violence doesn't really work necessarily
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.460]   because if you have an assassination,
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.940]   you're not assassinating the presidency.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.020]   If you take out a president,
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.580]   there's another president instantly there.
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.420]   So what have you accomplished?
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.900]   Someone's husband, dad is gone.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.140]   You replace them with someone who now is in a position
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.740]   to crack down and retaliate with even more violence.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.260]   So the calculus for me isn't there.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.100]   Would I be advocating for it then?
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:20.960]   Who knows?
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.100]   But I mean, I don't know if I'd be able to have the space
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.260]   to be, I certainly wouldn't have the space
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.380]   to be a podcaster or like a media personality.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.140]   That wasn't really a thing.
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.540]   To some extent, it was in the 1920s
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.060]   with the Algonquin Roundtable
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.620]   and all the people from the New Yorker magazine.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.420]   But they were all drunks.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:45.420]   It was very much a weird kind of situation to be a thinker.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.500]   - What would you think you would do?
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.380]   Work at a carnival?
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.220]   You look good in lipstick, so.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.580]   - Thank you.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.180]   I look good in anything.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.580]   What would I, I don't know.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.980]   I mean, you're not building robots.
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.340]   I mean, you could have been a Tesla, right?
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.180]   - Okay.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.620]   - I didn't mean a car, I meant the person.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.460]   - I understand.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.740]   Oh, thank you for explaining the witty comments to me.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.540]   - It wasn't witty at all.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.580]   'Cause you wouldn't be an Einstein
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.940]   'cause he was an immigrant.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.260]   - So I wouldn't work with an immigrant?
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.100]   What does that even mean?
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.060]   - No, you wouldn't have been a Tesla-like figure.
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.060]   There's already a Tesla,
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.180]   so you wouldn't literally be Tesla.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.420]   That's why you said a Tesla.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.500]   - Oh, a Tesla.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.340]   Okay, so all right.
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.380]   I take you for the explanation.
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.980]   See, Michael doesn't only make funny things,
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.420]   he also explains them for you.
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.260]   - It wasn't funny.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.100]   - Mansplains them.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.260]   - It wasn't funny at all.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.420]   - That I agree with.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.260]   - Okay.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.940]   - Okay, so yes, when you achieve--
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.540]   - See, this is why Kanye didn't like you, it's this.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.780]   - All right, I'm downgrading you from a nine down to an eight.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.900]   And if you keep talking like this,
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.500]   a five is a real possibility.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.900]   - All right, so the kind of vacuum that's created
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.900]   with violence is usually filled with a harsher figure.
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.980]   So you don't think violent revolution
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.580]   ultimately leads to positive progress in the short term?
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.420]   - Well, sometimes it does.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.260]   The American Revolution, I think, was a positive example.
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.660]   And overthrowing the czar, which was done peacefully,
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.060]   was a positive example.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.700]   But again, when violence happens, people get scared
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.540]   and they want the violence stopped immediately,
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.860]   and that's a call for authoritarianism.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.500]   And you see it time and time again.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.260]   And they also want retribution.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.420]   They were like, "Bring this back to normal."
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.820]   And they don't really worry about things
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.900]   like civil liberties or things like that.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:34.180]   And then it also creates this space for invasion
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.020]   from foreign sources or demagogues.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.660]   Like, "Oh, look, they're killing us in the streets.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.020]   "Now you gotta support me."
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.220]   It's a very deadly game, obviously.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.020]   - I remember somebody told me that, I forget where it was,
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.180]   but they told me that from the very beginning
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.980]   it was obvious that communism is an evil system,
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.620]   or a system that leads to evil.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.520]   And to me, at least, that's not,
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.180]   if I had to put myself in the beginning of the 20th century
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.820]   or at the end of the 19th century,
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.580]   that's totally not obvious.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.780]   They are trying to elevate humanity.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.340]   The basic worth of a human being,
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.740]   of a hardworking human being, of the working class,
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.620]   of the people that are doing the work and are striving
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.300]   and just really trying to build up society
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.340]   with their own hands, it just seems like a beautiful ideal.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.620]   So I guess the question is,
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.180]   can you see yourself believing in that,
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.860]   in the ideas of socialism and communism?
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.260]   Yeah, let's say if you were living in Russia.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.140]   - Oh yeah, easily.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.860]   So first of all, I don't think anything
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.780]   is obvious in politics.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:41.060]   It's not obvious that humans have rights.
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.780]   It's not obvious that liberty is better
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.580]   or the markets either.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.900]   Whether you're for a welfare state
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.420]   or you're for more free markets,
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.460]   neither of those is obvious.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.260]   Both of them involve an enormous amount of thought
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.420]   and background information.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.700]   So when someone says something is obvious,
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.940]   in politics they really mean something is apparent.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.940]   Well, it's not apparent on its face
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.820]   that if we all get together
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.740]   and promote a society based on equality
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.300]   and we all chip in that it's gonna really be good
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.140]   for everyone.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.020]   I mean, that to me is the promise of communism.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.180]   And it was also very appealing to many people
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.500]   because it was new.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.460]   So the idea was, all right, we've tried it these other ways.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.220]   There's all these negative consequences.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.780]   You have all these slums.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.260]   You have people getting fired
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.980]   and then they have no recourse.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.900]   You have women with 10 kids
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.300]   and they can't feed their kids.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.180]   Infant mortality.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.780]   You don't have sanitation.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.380]   You don't have food.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.460]   Everyone's illiterate and uneducated.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.260]   And then you're saying, look,
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.420]   if we all chip in together,
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.380]   everyone will have clothes,
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.220]   everyone will have food,
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.380]   everyone will be educated,
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.740]   everyone will do their part.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.020]   It's gonna be rough in the short period.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.300]   That's a very compelling case to be made for communism.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.700]   It's really easy in many ways
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.700]   when something hasn't been tried
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.740]   to make it sound compelling
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.380]   because you just talk about how great it's gonna be.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.620]   And then no one,
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.060]   people are always arguing about Venezuela and Sweden,
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.220]   like, oh, you want democratic socialism to be like Sweden.
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.780]   You don't want it to be like Venezuela.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.460]   The Venezuelans didn't vote for Venezuela.
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.380]   They voted for Sweden.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.140]   They ended up with Venezuela.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.700]   So it's, I think,
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.060]   and the thing with the communism,
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.700]   especially at that era,
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.060]   it was very much correlated
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.420]   with people who are too smart for their own good
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.260]   because they had the idea that
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.180]   if we're just put in charge,
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.220]   instead of these business people
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.700]   or these heirs to great estates,
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.940]   if the people who are smart and get it, like us,
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.780]   I don't mean you and me,
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.980]   like the people at the time who were advocating for it,
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.460]   once we're in charge,
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.020]   since we're good people
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.260]   and we want what's best for everyone,
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.500]   we're gonna make sure everyone's taken care of.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.820]   And they always talked about
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.660]   how much they cared about the little guy.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.740]   And so I'm sure some of them meant it a lot.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.580]   And they're like, look,
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.740]   if the guy in charge is very much concerned
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.580]   with the little guy,
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.220]   he's not gonna slip between the cracks
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.380]   and it's just gonna be absolutely great.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.540]   And we don't have to worry about
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:14.220]   the capitalist class just basically exploiting people
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.820]   and having these huge estates
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.260]   while these people can't even feed their own families.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.900]   - Since we have a little bit of momentum,
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.100]   can you steal me on the case for socialism?
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.820]   At that time and even today.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.100]   I don't know if it's,
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.300]   I don't know if there's a rhyme
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.220]   and similarity to those,
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.340]   to socialism as implemented at that time
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.660]   and what could possibly be implemented today,
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.700]   but maybe you can dance between the two.
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.440]   - The steel man argument for socialism is,
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.700]   if you have everything up to private industry,
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.020]   you do not have a guarantee
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.780]   that someone won't fall between the cracks.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.820]   And the other concern is,
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.140]   in any other context,
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.180]   if someone is let's suppose mentally ill, right?
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.660]   Through no fault of their own
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.860]   and they are or someone's handicapped,
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.300]   they can't feed themselves
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.060]   or mentally disabled or something like that.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.140]   If you have everything up to charity,
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.820]   some, if you see this with like endangered species, right?
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.700]   The species that are cute,
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.580]   it's easy to raise money for them or protect them.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.060]   Some weird kind of frog somewhere that no one cares about,
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.820]   you can't raise money for it.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.700]   People's interests are to what they find interesting.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.320]   So if someone is,
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.780]   someone who's like not socially appealing in some way,
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.180]   whatever capacity,
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.960]   they're gonna fall between the cracks and they're screwed.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.140]   Under socialism,
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.180]   if you have a government taking care of everything,
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.980]   no one is left behind.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.700]   You are guaranteed that the lowest of the low
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.640]   and the worst of the worst are still going to make sure
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.180]   that they're not starving the street or just left behind.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.980]   So that is a big moral case
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.060]   to be made for having the state running everything.
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.300]   In terms of economics, it's a lot harder,
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.140]   but the argument there would be,
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.780]   it's why it's not fair,
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.420]   a term which in my view does not actually have a good
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.620]   meaning, but it's not fair that
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.380]   because you were born a Rockefeller
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.780]   and I was born in Poland,
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.540]   that you never have to worry about food
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.720]   for the rest of your life.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.420]   Whereas I have to worry about,
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.200]   you know, paying for a doctor for my kid.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.660]   Like you just, you won this lottery when you're born
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.840]   and now I have to be screwed
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.120]   and I have to respect all your property, why?
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   So that is another strong argument to be made for socialism.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.420]   And the other argument is,
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.540]   if you have a media apparatus
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.540]   that is operated under profit seeking principles,
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.860]   it is going to feed into people's worst qualities,
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.740]   most basic animal like qualities
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.420]   and sensationalist qualities,
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.660]   and will be used as a mechanism for capitalist control.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.200]   Whereas if the government, which represents all of us,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.680]   all of us is running things,
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.360]   then everyone will have a right to have their voice heard
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.920]   and won't be manipulated.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.760]   That's the argument.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.460]   - What about the reaching towards the stateless version?
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:12.720]   Sort of, because you espouse the ideas of anarchism,
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.180]   it kind of has the same conclusion,
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.720]   which is reaching towards the removal of the state
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.320]   to where we, I guess, have some distributed
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.200]   reallocation of resources that are "fair."
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.780]   - But the thing is, the Marxist vision
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:31.000]   of the state withering away and becoming anarchism,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.960]   it's really kind of like the underpants gnomes,
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.800]   because it's like--
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.640]   - Tell me more.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.460]   - I will.
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.280]   Step one, you have Marxist--
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.160]   - Tell me slowly.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.260]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.360]   - You have full communism,
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.940]   the state's running everything, including education.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.440]   Step two, question mark, step three, anarchism.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.720]   So their idea was that after enough time,
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.800]   the nature of man himself was going to change,
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.940]   and then the government would be superfluous
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.760]   because we would all be equal,
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.340]   and we would all naturally,
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.000]   or socially, whatever term they would use,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.340]   want to act the part that we would need to do.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.140]   And in fact, Reagan had a great joke about this,
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.540]   where there were two commissars, I think, in Moscow,
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.800]   and one of them, they're walking around,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.280]   they're going, "Is this it?
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.320]   "Have we done it?
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.280]   "Have we reached full communism?"
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.120]   The other goes, "Oh no,
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.760]   "it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse."
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.800]   So that's kind of the counterargument to that.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.420]   - Do you think culture, society,
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.260]   can change the nature of man?
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.360]   - No.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.240]   - So no matter, you don't think this idea that,
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.280]   for example, America has been founded on,
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.700]   that all men are created equal,
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.420]   that that idea can't permeate the culture,
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.080]   and thereby change how we see each other,
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.320]   how we think of the basic worth of a human being,
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.680]   and thereby change our nature?
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.400]   - That's epigenetic.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.580]   I don't think that changes the nature of man.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.160]   I think, for example, if I say someone,
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.000]   which I agree with,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.080]   that someone is innocent until proven guilty,
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.520]   they're not literally innocent.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.880]   They're regarded in a legal context as innocent,
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.720]   but that person is or is not a murderer,
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.300]   a thief, or so on and so forth.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.320]   So we can legally and ethically regard everyone as equal,
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.800]   but as Thomas Sowell pointed out,
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.600]   a human being isn't even equal to himself
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.760]   over the course of a day.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.800]   Twins who are genetic clones are not equal to one another.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.520]   So it is a important thing legally,
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.120]   and it's a good yardstick, but it's not literally true.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.240]   - But don't you think that law becomes ethics?
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   So we, that idea of justice starts to,
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.300]   we start to internalize it, that we just,
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.620]   the way we behave, the way we think about the world?
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.060]   - No, I think it's a complete red herring,
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.980]   because no one is--
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.660]   - No, you're a red herring.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.500]   - Okay.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.100]   - See what I did there?
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.940]   - Seletka.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.940]   Because someone is, people are still going
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.220]   to always prefer their family to strangers,
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.020]   or their in-group to out-group.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.120]   So in terms of if you're gonna have equality,
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.940]   that means it's gonna not matter to you
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.540]   whether someone is your mom
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.100]   or someone is someone down the street,
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.460]   and I don't see how that will ever become the case.
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.580]   - Do you think it would be possible
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.140]   if you were an intellectual,
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.700]   like you are at the beginning of the 20th century,
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.020]   would you be able to predict the rest of the 20th century?
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.060]   - No, I don't think at all.
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:36.060]   I think there was so many out-of-nowhere turns
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.740]   that no one would have seen them coming.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.860]   And as an example, Lenin seizing power
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:46.460]   and making the Bolshevik Revolution a reality
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.900]   was regarded as utopian and insane.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.780]   The fact that he pulled it off is close to miraculous,
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.920]   and it was quite literally unprecedented.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.460]   The fact that, so that's a very big one.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.660]   - Which aspect of it, sorry to interrupt,
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.180]   which aspect was hard to predict,
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.360]   that a singular figure with just some ideas
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.620]   would be able to take so much power?
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.820]   - And maintain that power and remake that society
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.780]   so drastically, so quickly, despite such opposition.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.260]   - Also not just a set of temporary protests
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.620]   by hooligans that lead to turmoil in the short term,
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.780]   but then stabilizes,
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.060]   but literally changes the entirety of the society.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.980]   - Yeah, Ludendorff, who was the German general,
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.800]   he's like, all right,
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.980]   we gotta get the Russians out of World War I.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.160]   He's the one who's like, all right,
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.500]   let's get this lunatic Lenin,
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.020]   who already tried and failed to have a revolution in Russia,
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.420]   let's send him back there,
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.420]   and he's just gonna cause problems to everybody,
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.260]   and it's gonna be great,
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.500]   'cause it's gonna weaken Russia,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.100]   and then our Eastern Front isn't gonna have to be a problem.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.700]   And then to his surprise, and everyone else's,
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.660]   including anarchists and communists worldwide,
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.640]   they pulled off this October revolution,
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.340]   and then for a while, it's like, all right,
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.900]   I mean, I think my understanding is even people at the time
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.660]   in St. Petersburg and in Moscow were like,
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:02.980]   what does this even mean, right?
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.860]   Like no one took it seriously,
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.420]   and then very quickly, you had the Cheka,
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.780]   and the secret police,
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.060]   and all these other kind of implementations
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.620]   of the communist state, and people are like,
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.860]   oh, they're not messing around,
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.020]   but they're like, all right,
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.900]   this is not gonna last for long,
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.600]   and the USA, the US and A,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.020]   we didn't even recognize the Soviet Union's legitimacy
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.500]   for a very long time, there were no diplomatic relations,
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.940]   and after a certain point, it's like,
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.980]   if you don't recognize Lenin and Stalin's government,
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.540]   who's the government of Russia or the Soviet Union?
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.380]   Is it the Tsar?
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.740]   Like you have to recognize it,
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.420]   it's just they're not going anywhere,
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.720]   so that was something that was not,
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.700]   I think, very predictable.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.060]   The Great Depression, in retrospect,
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.500]   there were certain things that were predictable,
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.160]   but it was not at all the case that it needed to last
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.180]   as long as it did in the States as FDR made it do,
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.900]   so there's all sorts of things.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.900]   I mean, if they fought Germany's remilitarization,
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.860]   World War II could have been prevented
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.620]   if you didn't have the Treaty of Versailles.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.880]   Would you have the hyperinflation?
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.900]   Would you have Hitler?
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.780]   These are all, I think, choose your own adventure moments
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.540]   where things could have gone in other directions.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.700]   I don't believe this kind of idea,
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.820]   this is a very Marxist idea that history is inevitable,
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.900]   and once you start with certain premises,
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.660]   the contradictions kind of unfold.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.480]   I think that's ridiculous.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.320]   - I feel like there's power in the Santa Claus outfit.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.160]   - Yeah?
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.040]   - I mean, it's a fundamentally communist idea, right?
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.100]   - How? - Santa Claus.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.500]   - Arbitrary redistribution of wealth.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.920]   - It's not redistribution.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.900]   - Well, at least I decide who's good and bad.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.280]   Only I, only I know this,
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.740]   and I mean, I am somehow getting funding from somewhere,
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.580]   right? - No.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:51.380]   - Okay, listen, I have so much to teach you.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.740]   - You have a workshop. - Little Michael.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.740]   Workshop, yeah, and how many people do you think
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.780]   are employed in this workshop?
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.820]   - They're slaves.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.780]   - Yes.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.880]   - I don't know, how many elves are in the workshop?
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.780]   I think the rest of you are gonna have to look into it.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.540]   No, anyway, and the red colors and everything.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.100]   Is that the biggest holiday of all time, Christmas?
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:12.500]   Like, just in terms of the intensity of the festivities?
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.500]   - No, I think Christmas is a very recent phenomenon.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.860]   I think historically it was not a big deal.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.340]   - No, I know, historically it has not been,
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.900]   but in terms of how much it captivates,
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.820]   how intense it is, I guess from a capitalist perspective,
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.020]   like how much is going on, how visual it is,
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.540]   how intense it is, how it grabs a whole population.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.160]   I think it's because the idea of Christmas
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.120]   is probably one of the most powerful holiday ideas.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.560]   Easter's probably up there.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.920]   Easter's obviously up there 'cause you have Christ resurrect,
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.800]   Christ dying, his resurrection, so that's kind of a big one,
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.540]   but Christmas is this symbol of brotherhood
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.640]   and kindness and magnanimity.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.880]   You know, one of the things I despise about our culture
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.160]   is this, and something I'm fighting very heavily
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.920]   with this book, or at least attempting to,
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.240]   is this glorification of cynicism,
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.800]   this kind of like, oh, you like this song, that's cute,
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.160]   stupid, whereas Christmas is the one time of year
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.600]   where you could be happy and joyous and kind,
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.120]   and people don't get to roll their eyes at you.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.020]   They get to stop being too cool for school,
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.720]   and they get to be like, you know, I enjoy your friendship,
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.100]   you're my sister, my brother, my dad, my mom, whatever,
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.880]   and it was Ayn Rand's favorite holiday.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.960]   I adore it, especially Christmas in New York,
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.620]   and it's just this idea of like, even though we're cold
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.480]   and it's dark outside, you know, it's still this kind of,
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.240]   like it's still cozy, and let's hope the next year is,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.760]   'cause with Russians, Dneprovsk Santa comes on New Year's,
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.400]   so it's kind of like, let's make this next year
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.080]   an even better one, so it's very much
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.880]   the holiday of hope and joy.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.720]   - And like love for family, for friends, for friendship.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.720]   - And kindness and benevolence, yeah.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.440]   And like almost the whole, that whole rat race
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.280]   of chasing material possessions and all that
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.360]   gets put on hold for a brief moment,
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.760]   and it just all goes quiet.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.720]   - But it's also like giving people material possessions,
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.200]   like here, like I value you,
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.920]   this is something that brings you joy, yeah.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.560]   - Yeah, you write in the book, which by the way,
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.760]   people should go get, buy it right now,
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.800]   if you support this podcast,
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.680]   or if you support the ridiculous outfits
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.800]   that Michael wears, the more books you buy,
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.360]   the more outfits he is gonna wear.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.400]   I've got two, my next two appearances in the show,
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.000]   assuming I don't burn this bridge,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.080]   I've got some good ones.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.680]   - This bridge has been burning for a long time.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.560]   We've been going across the road by canoe at this point.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.260]   Next time we're gonna be swimming.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:45.240]   - How the hell are you gonna swim?
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.480]   You're made out of lead.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.680]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.760]   Sink to the bottom, get dragged across by rope.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.520]   Okay, you write in the book, cynics like to lie
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.040]   and call themselves realists,
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.800]   hoping for positive outcomes,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.820]   can thus be dismissed as being naive or utopian.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.240]   Can you elaborate on this point,
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.640]   just like you said right now?
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.400]   It seems like a,
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.360]   I don't know if it's a fundamental characteristic
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.300]   of our society today, or just societies throughout history,
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.000]   but there is a cynicism.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.400]   You write in the Soviet Union,
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.200]   it was a really, there's a deep cynicism.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.840]   - That was good at the end, yeah.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.960]   - But there is a cynicism today as well,
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.280]   at least in public discourse.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.240]   - Yes.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.080]   - Why does it happen and how can we fight it?
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.880]   - I think it is easy
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.940]   to be like, "Eh, everything sucks."
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.280]   You know, I had my friend Lux,
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.500]   she was a blogger, she was an author.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.520]   She had this great line, 'cause we worked in media,
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.120]   and she's like, "If you're at a party
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.860]   "and someone starts talking about a new app or website
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.720]   "and you don't know anything about it, just say,
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.780]   "Oh, I was on that for a while, it sucked."
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.620]   (laughs)
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.100]   And that's all you need to say.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.680]   I'm like, Lux, that's a great line.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.020]   But I think it is, and especially,
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.900]   I'm sure you experienced this as well with your family,
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.640]   I certainly did with mine.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.540]   There is this idea, especially in Russian culture,
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.060]   but in American culture to some extent as well,
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.860]   where if you have aspirations,
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.320]   I remember there was this show called "Russian Dolls."
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.740]   It was, "Oh, I just got it."
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.080]   Like the Matryoshka, okay, I just got it, that's the name.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.900]   Okay, the show was called "Russian Dolls."
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.820]   It was about Brighton Beach,
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.780]   which is the Russian Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.880]   It was supposed to be their version of Jersey Shore.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.600]   It was on Lifetime and it had no ratings.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.340]   And I remember the last four episodes,
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.660]   they had to burn them, so they just ran it
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.620]   through like 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. one day.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.280]   And there was this one scene where one of the girls,
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.320]   I forget her name, probably Natalia,
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.900]   and she'd been in college,
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:50.220]   and she had been wondering what she wanted to major in.
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.020]   And this story was so perfect,
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.420]   I'm sure I've told it before.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.140]   And she took an aptitude test and she went with her mom
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.020]   to get like Manny Pettis or something.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.020]   And she goes, "Mom, you know, I've had like 80 majors.
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.700]   "I didn't know what I wanted to do."
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.120]   And she goes, "I took this aptitude test.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.780]   "It really made sense to me.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.440]   "I am gonna go to law school.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.320]   "I wanna be a lawyer.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.300]   "This is something I enjoy."
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.820]   And the first thing out of her mom's mouth
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.380]   is how are you gonna pay for it?
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.480]   And the girl, and I really related,
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.260]   'cause if you didn't have this Russian upbringing,
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.020]   you watched it, you would think her reaction
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.460]   was completely insane.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.620]   She just lost it, just screaming.
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.060]   She's like, "People pay for law school all the time.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.180]   "I'll figure out a way."
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.760]   Why is your first reaction to look for a problem?
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.840]   Why is your first response to be like,
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.780]   "Oh, are you sure you've thought this through?
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.120]   "I have been struggling with one problem for years,
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.800]   "what I wanted to do for a living.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.700]   "And now like as soon as I solve
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.620]   "this one big problem of identity,
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.980]   "your first reaction is like, let's find a new problem."
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.340]   Why is that your, instead of,
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.660]   "Let's figure out how we're gonna pay for it."
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:49.580]   And that kind of approach is so deadly
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.060]   and it gnaws at you.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.620]   And I always, I don't like giving people advice
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.620]   because who the hell am I?
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.460]   And also if I don't know the context of the problem,
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.220]   I'm not informed enough to give advice.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.620]   But this is piece of advice that I do for comfort giving.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.860]   If you are someone who has around you
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.780]   people who as soon as you have any accomplishment
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.280]   or any hope that their first reaction is to be like,
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.740]   "Well, what about this?"
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.700]   You have to get rid of them or sit them down,
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.920]   maybe give them a chance.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:21.520]   Because that is something that is such so demoralizing
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.860]   and it drains you.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.220]   And it's like, the example I've used all the time,
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.700]   all the time, all the time.
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.420]   I say, if you wanna be an author, right?
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.440]   You can go to any bookstore
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.020]   and look at all the shitty, shitty books,
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.380]   like the "White Pill."
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.960]   And you could say to yourself,
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.500]   "I could be the shitty author."
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.660]   You don't have to be Hemingway.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.500]   So people should buy your book just to know
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.980]   that it doesn't take much.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.580]   It really does not take much.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.620]   - What shitty writing is all about.
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.660]   And boring.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:55.220]   - Yeah, you could just pick a random period in history
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.660]   and just write a bunch of crap about it.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.860]   And put a pretty stamp on the cover and just go.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.660]   - It was pretty, yeah.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.340]   But I mean, like for you, right?
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.740]   I don't mean you, Lex, but--
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.140]   - I was raised by the wolves.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.420]   - The wolf bots.
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.500]   There's lots of standup comedians
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.020]   who aren't Jerry Seinfeld, right?
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.260]   If you wanna be a podcaster,
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.500]   you don't have to be Joe Rogan.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.900]   You could be someone who's got a medium audience
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.940]   and are enjoying it.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.260]   So the idea that something has to be,
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.500]   you have to be a massive superstar or you're a failure
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.060]   is also ridiculous, but that's cynicism.
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.980]   - I mean, you can even be a failed comedian
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.980]   like Dave Smith.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.500]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.620]   This is a generic name I came up with as an example.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.740]   I think he has a podcast of some kind.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.900]   - I like it. - Yeah.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.740]   Not very funny.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.740]   I don't know why he would call himself a comedian, but--
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.180]   - You mean he's being ironic.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:47.100]   - Don't you think?
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.820]   Yeah, so even then you could do something special.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.020]   - I remember what you did with me in the movie theater.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:53.860]   - What's that?
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.100]   Oh, you continue.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.260]   Can you explain the jokes?
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.300]   'Cause I can't.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.480]   - I'm not explaining jokes.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.660]   I'm wearing lipstick.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.040]   It's not enough.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.300]   - Now I remember what you did to me in a movie theater.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.180]   And you wore lipstick that night too.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.960]   - Not when I was done.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.420]   - People for sure will think,
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.420]   this feels like a gay porn.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.980]   Like a very long intro.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.620]   - 'Cause we're not wearing pants?
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.420]   - Yes, there's many reasons why this feels like this.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.400]   And the outfits and just everything about this.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.260]   - How would you know?
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.540]   - I am my friend.
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.260]   I have stories.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.900]   - I thought I don't have friends.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:34.820]   - They're all suspiciously named either Lex or Lux
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.980]   or some variation.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.820]   Like you lack complete creativity.
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.180]   Just like in the writing room.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.020]   - Or Lux.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.260]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:46.060]   - It's like you didn't even use a thesaurus for your book.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.960]   The same words over and over and over.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.580]   The sad thing about the cynicism is like,
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.700]   I don't think it's just a Russian thing.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.860]   I think the people--
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.300]   - Let me trust you 'cause I didn't finish
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.140]   what you were saying earlier.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.100]   In America, it's not just a Russian thing.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.100]   In American culture, if you have a sitcom or a musical,
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:11.300]   it's regarded as less legitimate than a drama.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.340]   If something's gotta be about someone struggling
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.840]   or someone suffering,
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.180]   whereas this is like a joyous, happy story,
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.940]   maybe something like Pixar.
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.780]   Sure, they have conflict and they're going for something,
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.140]   but overall, the background the universe is taking in
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.640]   is very joyous and happy.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.420]   That is regarded artistically as less legitimate
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:33.660]   than something which is dark and the background is despair.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:38.660]   And that very subtly sends a very, to me, pernicious message
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:43.700]   that what's real is despair and happiness is the aberration.
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.460]   And I think if you have that as your mindset,
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.860]   you're setting yourself up for maybe not failure,
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.360]   but certainly not happiness.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.380]   - Yeah, but that's in the figures,
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.980]   the ideas that the culture elevates.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.260]   But at the local personal life of parents and teachers,
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.660]   that still happens a lot.
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.660]   In Russia and here, just my whole life,
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.820]   especially 'cause I'm a weirdo,
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:11.820]   I've been kind of told to basically be less weird.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:21.220]   There's a kind of sense in where there's a certain path
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.500]   you're supposed to take in life.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.540]   And every time you have a little bit of success
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.300]   on those very specifically defined paths,
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.600]   you're pushed to do more and more and more on those paths,
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.660]   as opposed to celebrating the full complexity
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.940]   of the weirdo that each one of us is.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.180]   And I certainly am.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:41.180]   And I just, teachers, even friends, and certainly family,
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:47.220]   have constantly been very cynical about my aspirations,
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.020]   my dreams, and so on.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.340]   I think that actually created
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.100]   a deeply self-critical engine in my brain
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.780]   that I think ultimately was productive
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:05.100]   because it was also balanced by just an internal,
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.080]   maybe through genetics, thing I have of optimism
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.640]   about the world, of just seeing the beauty in the world.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:16.340]   But it is weird looking back how much people that love me
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.480]   were trying to bring me down.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.480]   - Yeah. - It's so strange.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.080]   - It's also very hurtful for me
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.720]   because when I graduated college,
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.680]   it was important for me to be self-made
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.640]   and not take money from my family.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.860]   And I remember my grandma, this was a huge argument,
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.260]   an ongoing argument.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.020]   And one time, as she was leaving my house,
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.220]   she slipped money in under the door and I threw it out.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.500]   And it made me so angry.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.720]   Or like one year for my birthday,
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.380]   she gave me, I think, like $500,
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.460]   which was a lot of money when you're like 22 or 23.
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:50.900]   And I was so pissed because that told me
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:54.220]   that they didn't believe that I'd be able to feed myself
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.860]   or make it on my own.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.080]   And I understand their mindset,
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.740]   but it's like I'm not, I wasn't, you know,
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.860]   I was never hungry.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.360]   Like maybe I couldn't, I remember I'd have to wait
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.340]   on the subway 'cause I couldn't afford a cab.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.740]   But that was a sacrifice I had to make.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:10.780]   You know, I had to wait that half hour.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.500]   So it was a huge source and remains a source
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.300]   of enormous tension and contention.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.340]   And I think also, I'm sure speaking to your upbringing,
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.260]   in their minds, unless you're going into an office,
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.300]   you can't pay the rent.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.500]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.620]   So-- - But there's,
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.500]   just like you said, forget the office, forget all that.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.940]   No matter what, there's always,
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.340]   whatever you accomplish in life,
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.380]   you always do, you're always negative
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.360]   about your current position.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.900]   You always come up with another problem, just like you said.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.980]   - I remember-- - There's always,
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.240]   it's like a self-generating problem box.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.560]   - Yeah, I remember I didn't speak to my dad for a few years
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.940]   and then I'm like, let me give this guy another chance.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.180]   And in that time period, Harvey Pekar,
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.940]   the author of "Subject of American Splendor,"
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.100]   the movie and author of the series of comic books,
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.100]   he and I became friends
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.940]   and he was writing a graphic novel about me.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.860]   And when I met with my dad, I'm like,
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.460]   oh, someone's writing a book about me.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.780]   And he goes, I know, so?
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.180]   And it was one of those moments where I'm like,
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:20.620]   wow, you're an asshole and not the kind of asshole I am.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.580]   You're just like not a good person.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:26.160]   And I don't know or really at this point care
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.200]   what the motivation or if there was no motivation
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.040]   with the visceral emotional reasoning for that.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.780]   But that kind of thing is something I,
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:39.920]   much later now in life, have absolutely no tolerance for.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.800]   - Well, in my own private life,
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.360]   I try to forgive and love those people.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.600]   But it is, there've been a few in my life like this.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.320]   And I think they are incredible people
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.920]   if you allow yourself to see it, but they're flawed.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:58.380]   And so I try to forgive them.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.260]   That said, it is true that the people
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.820]   that are close to you, especially family,
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.140]   have a disproportionate psychological effect on you.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.340]   So you have to be very careful
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.460]   having them in your life too much.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.020]   Like one thing is to love them
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:15.220]   and the other is to actually allow yourself to flourish.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.140]   Surround yourself with people that help you flourish.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.500]   And like you said, the advice there is really powerful,
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:24.960]   especially early on, to have people that believe in you,
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.800]   in whatever crazy big dreams you have,
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.160]   that pat you on the back and say, "You got this, kid."
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.640]   - And here's the other thing.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.480]   If you try and you don't make it to that Rogan level,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.040]   it's okay.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.560]   Like I have several books that I've written
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.200]   that are on my hard drive that have not been published.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.840]   And there were a lot of work.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.360]   And it was really disappointing when they went out
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.720]   and no publishers were interested in it.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.600]   Maybe I'll publish them one day, maybe I won't.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.480]   Point being, it's fine, I tried.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.760]   - Is it a romance novel?
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.000]   - One is, one is a--
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.200]   - Gay romance novel?
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.000]   Does it have a guy in a Santa outfit?
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.680]   - Can you please stop asking me to send you gay pornography?
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.000]   He's calling me up all hours of the night.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.560]   I need more gay porn.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.760]   I need some ones, I only have zeros.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.100]   - Yeah, never enough.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.480]   This one almost got a book deal.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.480]   This would have been, it was 16 years ago.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.000]   It was a ladlet novel.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.120]   - What kind of novel?
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.440]   - Ladlet, it's like Nick Hornby.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.520]   - What? - Nick Hornby.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.360]   About a boy.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.800]   So there was a little mini genre of these books
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.240]   about young men trying to struggle their way through.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.520]   It's a whole little, there's a whole little series
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.920]   of them, Fight Club is adjacent to that.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.240]   It's not literally ladlet.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.800]   - I feel like you would write
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.240]   a great Fight Club type novel.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.060]   No? - You know,
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.400]   as much, and Chuck Palahniuk,
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.080]   it's my understanding, admitted this.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.960]   Fight Club is one of the few things
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.960]   where the movie is better than the book.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.920]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   But the movie's so iconic, yeah, for sure.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.580]   But still, isn't there a deeply philosophical,
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.120]   it's kind of like David Foster Wallace novels.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.920]   Doesn't Fight Club capture some moment in time
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.760]   that's very kind of--
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.120]   - I was hanging out with Kurt Metzger
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.720]   a couple weeks ago, comedian, very failed--
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.040]   - Name drop. - Yeah.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.280]   Hey, Kurt. - Watch out.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.780]   - And he had this great story.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.100]   He was hanging out with Patrice O'Neill,
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.500]   the late comedian. - Name drop.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.620]   - One of the great comics of all time.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:27.700]   And Patrice goes, Kurt was talking about
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.620]   how much he liked the book or the movie Fight Club,
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.420]   and Patrice's like, that is the whitest book on Earth.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.940]   He goes, your problem in life
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.780]   is you don't have enough violence.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.900]   Your problem in life, you need someone to beat you up.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.860]   That's not a problem for me.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.420]   - Yeah, well, I mean, but still,
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.760]   it is a very white book,
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.600]   but it still captures a kind of anger and an angst
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.640]   and a certain subculture in society.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.720]   - Yes, yes. - That's really powerful.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.360]   That probably led to, in some part,
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.460]   to the thing you wrote about in the new right.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.480]   - Oh, for sure. - When you came about.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.040]   - I mean, it was this kind of,
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.640]   there's that line in the movie where Edward Norton says,
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.240]   "I'm a 30-year-old boy."
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.160]   This kind of question of what is it,
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.200]   sorry to be Matt Walsh,
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.960]   but what does it mean to be a man, right?
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.800]   What does masculinity mean?
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:16.440]   Why are so many men at such a young age feeling so lost?
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.000]   This idea that if I fill my house with nice furniture,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.840]   that's still not gonna be fulfilling to anyone.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.200]   - Matt Walsh is--
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.120]   - He's from "The Daily Wire."
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.300]   He just did a documentary called "What is a Woman?"
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.140]   - Can you explain?
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:27.960]   I don't know who he is.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.440]   - So Matt Walsh is someone who works for "The Daily Wire."
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.280]   - Yes.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.120]   - And he just recently did a documentary called
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.600]   "What is a Woman?"
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.600]   I think it was called.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.520]   And he went out to lots of people working in gender theory
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.120]   and all that thing.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.160]   And he asked them to define,
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.600]   and he went to the Maasai in Africa, the tribe,
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.760]   and to talk to people about transgenderism, non-binary,
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.320]   which is a word I know you hate.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.560]   And the documentary was surprisingly well done.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.980]   - Is that like a passive-aggressive compliment?
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.280]   Surprisingly well done.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:02.600]   - Well, because Matt is very aggressive on Twitter.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.760]   We follow each other.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.680]   And there was a lot of opportunities in this film
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.520]   for him to really be like, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.280]   And instead, to his credit, he let the people speak.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.040]   And it's possible it was edited a certain way.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.640]   Of course, it was obviously edited.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.960]   But when he just asked them,
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.360]   "Can you just define a woman for me?"
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.040]   And playing dumb, or not playing dumb,
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.480]   just saying, "What's your opinion?"
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.960]   A lot of the people he was speaking to
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.920]   were getting extremely agitated.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.840]   So it worked in that kind of context as well.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.660]   It was not his usual style.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.840]   - Speaking of which,
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.080]   do you ever regret your behavior on Twitter?
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.660]   - There were a couple of times, but very rarely.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.520]   - Can you describe the big strategy
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.580]   before we dive back into the October revolution?
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.760]   - My strategy--
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.920]   - Do you have a strategy, or is it,
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.640]   does it come from the heart?
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.560]   Or does it come from the brain?
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.520]   - It comes from, "I want to have fun."
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.800]   So that's literally what it comes down to.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.640]   It's like, this is--
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.840]   - Girls just wanna have fun.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.760]   - Are you drunk?
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.720]   What is in there?
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.760]   - I'm very cheeky.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.160]   I have the holiday spirit,
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.640]   even though it's not the holidays.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.480]   - Oh, that's eggnog in there.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.320]   - Delirious.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.680]   I did not sleep much last night.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.640]   I've been, which is, I think the second time we talked,
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.720]   or the third time, the second time,
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.440]   I stayed up almost all night.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.280]   - Oh, I know.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.560]   I keep track of when you come and go.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.320]   So my door camera points at your garage,
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:32.120]   so I know when you're leaving or coming home.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:36.040]   - My camera points at your bedroom from the inside,
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.760]   but I shouldn't have told you that now.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:39.600]   - Let me ask you this,
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.040]   'cause this is something that's been bothering me.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.560]   There was a chair that you threw out.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.400]   - Yep, it was broken.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.680]   - And I was looking at my camera,
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.520]   and I'm like, "Let me see when he threw this out."
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.160]   And then one time you went to the garbage
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.640]   and you adjusted it to make it stick
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.680]   out of the garbage even more.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.000]   What were you doing there?
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.120]   - Was I, oh, to make sure that people know
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.240]   there's a chair in there.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.480]   - Is that really what you, why?
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.680]   - Well, like the garbage person,
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.560]   so they'd notice the chair, so they don't get,
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.480]   like, I always think I don't want them
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.640]   to get hurt or whatever.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.520]   - Oh, okay.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.360]   - Like, they open the thing, it's like, "Ah, chair."
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.840]   I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.040]   - Okay, it was really odd.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.240]   - I didn't know how to get rid of a chair.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.320]   It was broken, it was cracked, and I didn't,
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.160]   it was a problem.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.480]   - So Twitter for me, my point is to have fun.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.280]   It's also fun to kinda smack down people
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.520]   who I regard as bad actors,
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.400]   and also kinda to promote news that I find interesting
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.240]   that maybe isn't as prominently part of the culture
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.320]   as it might otherwise be.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.680]   - Do you think sometimes you draw too broadly
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.480]   the category of people that are bad actors,
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:44.480]   and then thereby sort of adding to the mockery
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.440]   and the cynicism in the world?
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.880]   - I don't think mockery and cynicism are at all synonymous.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.680]   I think cynicism means everyone sucks.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.680]   I don't think everyone sucks.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:57.420]   I think it is undeniable that a lot of people suck.
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.560]   - What if I told you most people don't suck?
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.240]   Could you steel man the case that most people don't suck?
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.440]   - Sure, I can do it in a cynical way, honestly.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.800]   It's quasi-cynical way.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.640]   I think most people are neither here nor there.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.060]   Most people just kinda go with the flow.
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.080]   They're amiable.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.120]   Human beings are social creatures.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.740]   They wanna get along.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.160]   They don't wanna cause problems.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.400]   They don't have the capacity to be the target of a problem.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.840]   So most people, I mean, if most people sucked,
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.120]   then going anywhere would be an excruciating ordeal, right?
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.740]   Like literally, the airport's annoying,
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.440]   but if most people sucked, it would really be annoying.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.980]   Going to the supermarket would be really annoying.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.180]   So I don't think most people suck,
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:43.180]   but I do think that in public discourse,
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:47.980]   there are lots of people who are dishonest
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.600]   about their agenda.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.700]   For example, I could be someone
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.040]   who's promoting a certain ideology,
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.320]   but I'm in the payroll of a candidate,
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.400]   or my think tank needs this to happen,
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.400]   or I'm being paid for something like that.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.600]   So that sort of thing, I think, happens all the time.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.120]   There's the line I have in the book, Upton Sinclair.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.320]   I forgot how he worded exactly,
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.640]   but it's very hard to convince someone of something
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.120]   if his payroll depends on him
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.680]   not being convinced of it, right?
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.160]   So I think things like that are...
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.200]   The thing I'm really excited about
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.180]   with what Elon's doing with Twitter,
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.800]   and I'm just ecstatic about this,
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.600]   is to have the context now.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   So you'll have a politician making a claim,
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.280]   and they're gonna word it in certain ways.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.600]   My favorite example is when people are like,
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.280]   if you look at the years 2002 to 2020,
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.080]   terrorism in America, it's like,
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.680]   did anything happen in 2001?
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.960]   Is there a reason you just coincidentally started in 2002?
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:42.880]   Things like that.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:46.360]   So when people are manipulating things
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.600]   to force an outcome that they want,
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.200]   and to promote an idea that they want disingenuously,
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.520]   to have that underneath that in Twitter now,
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.840]   where the audience provides context,
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.720]   I think is something extremely useful,
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.700]   and it's a great way to nip propaganda in the bud.
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.640]   And propaganda pervades the entire political spectrum,
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.840]   of course.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.160]   - The interesting thing about Twitter
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.320]   is also the discussion about free speech and so on.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:13.080]   I think it's interesting to discuss free speech
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.160]   and the freedom of the press
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.640]   from the context of the Soviet Union.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.680]   - Sure.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.680]   - Let's return to the October Revolution and Lenin.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.340]   What was the October Revolution?
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.720]   What, who was Lenin?
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.840]   What are some interesting aspects of this human being,
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.360]   and also this moment in history that stand out to you,
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.800]   that are important to understand?
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.800]   - I think the interesting thing about Lenin
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.720]   is he was a zealot,
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.680]   and he was a visionary,
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.080]   and he really kind of meant it.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.720]   And I'm skipping ahead a little bit,
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:52.880]   but Lenin also was someone who was strategic.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.800]   So at a certain point when they were trying
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.960]   to advance communism throughout the Soviet Union,
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.880]   and the costs were outweighing the benefits,
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.160]   he did a strategic retreat.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.040]   He did the new economic policy,
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.640]   you had a rise of kind of these small capitalists
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.920]   coming back, you could hire people again.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.040]   And for the hardcore people in the Soviet Union,
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.200]   hardcore communists, this was a huge betrayal.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.640]   It's a step back.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.960]   He didn't do it because he was some kind of crypto capitalist.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.800]   He did it because he's like,
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.120]   "All right, we know where we gotta get to,
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.620]   "but we have to go at a certain pace,
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:24.280]   "and we have to adjust as we go along."
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.760]   So to have someone who is that much of an ideologue,
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.400]   and that much of a visionary,
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:34.120]   but still to have any element of pragmatism to him
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.720]   is I think a very rare combination.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.800]   - And that pragmatism, do you think that's ultimately
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.000]   where things go wrong?
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.880]   That's where you sacrifice the ideas.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.360]   - Pragmatism in this case was good
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.280]   because by taking a step back,
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.420]   he kind of gave himself some breathing room
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.940]   to allow the revolution to continue, to win the civil war.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.900]   There was a big moment where Germany,
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:01.840]   it's just there's lots of like little funny anecdotes
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.600]   that I learned while researching this book.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.600]   So Germany and Russia, they were negotiating a ceasefire
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:12.460]   'cause Germany wanted Russia out of the war.
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.820]   And basically Germany was like,
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.080]   "All right, we'll let you leave,
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.780]   "but you have to sign this treaty
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:19.380]   "and basically hand over all this land
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.840]   "that we're currently occupying."
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.980]   It was just parts of Ukraine, parts of Poland.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.500]   And Lenin tells Trotsky to stall,
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.980]   he's just run the clock because he was of the belief
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:32.420]   that now that they've taken power in Russia,
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:34.020]   you're gonna have a worldwide workers' revolution.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:35.620]   So he's like, "Just stall them."
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.260]   And he stalled, he stalled, and at a certain point,
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:39.260]   Germany's like, "All right, you're signing this tomorrow
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:40.540]   "or we're invading."
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.060]   And Trotsky basically said,
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.520]   "Yeah, so we're leaving the war,
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:45.740]   "but we're not signing anything."
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.300]   And the Germans are like, "What?"
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.700]   And he's like, "Yeah, well, that's what we're doing,
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.100]   "so hey."
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.840]   And basically, eventually he had to sign the treaty
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:57.800]   and cede huge parts of the land and a lot of money.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:01.520]   And this was a very precarious moment for him
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.040]   to maintain control of Russia.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:06.160]   And people were telling him,
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:09.040]   "You've lost huge amounts of territory,
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.440]   "you've blown it, you should be in jail."
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.060]   And he's like, "Watch your mouth,
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.740]   "because if you look forward to the future,
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.800]   "it'll be clear which one of us is more likely
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.040]   "to be the one ending up in jail."
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.440]   And he was absolutely right.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.620]   - This was Trotsky or Lenin saying?
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.460]   - This was Lenin saying this to Karl Radick.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:26.300]   - So who are these figures here?
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.900]   Who's Trotsky, who's Lenin, who's Stalin?
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.900]   What are some interesting aspects of all of this?
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:34.420]   What are, sort of just to linger on it,
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.380]   the personalities, the ideas that were important?
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.860]   - Well, Trotsky came late to Bolshevism.
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.700]   He was really the brains, in many ways,
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:44.300]   of the October Revolution.
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.100]   He was an amazing strategist.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.940]   He never forgot that he was an amazing strategist,
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.580]   had a very high opinion of himself.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.380]   - And by the way, the October Revolution, 1917,
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.000]   that's a key moment.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.180]   Of course, the Russian Revolution lasted a long time,
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:04.380]   but this was a key moment of, what,
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:07.900]   a phase shift towards success of the Bolsheviks.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:08.740]   - Well, that was the moment.
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.820]   That was like, "All right, we are the government now.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:12.460]   "And now we have to make it."
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.440]   You know, like Thomas Jefferson said,
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.880]   I think it was Thomas Jefferson, no, it was Ben Franklin,
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.140]   "A republic, if you can keep it."
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.660]   It's like, "All right, we've made our own kind of government
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.460]   "if we can keep it," 'cause that was the big question.
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:23.900]   You had an international blockade,
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.600]   you had the white armies, the czarist forces
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.100]   who wanted to restore czarism,
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.900]   or at least the parliament right before Lenin took over.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.020]   So this was a big kind of, no one's,
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:36.860]   you know, in some ways, it was like the 2016 election.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.340]   It's like, "All right, we vote in Trump.
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.740]   "Well, what's this gonna look like?"
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.260]   Like, no one had any idea
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.860]   of what a Trump presidency was gonna look like.
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:47.080]   All we knew was this guy's on Twitter running his mouth,
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.320]   he's insulting people, and he's had all these views,
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.520]   some are over here, some are over there.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.480]   - And the funny thing is the Russians hacked both elections.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.200]   (Lex laughing)
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.920]   - See? - That's true.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   It was Putin and the gremlin.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.980]   So Trotsky was, you know, Lenin's right-hand man.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.960]   And he was, you know, enormous.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:09.680]   And to this day, he remains this kind of figure
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:14.680]   who is supposedly a less authoritative,
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:18.660]   authoritarian, anti-Stalinist version of communism
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:21.660]   that people can endorse.
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.340]   And Stalin, of course, was Lenin's successor.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.820]   At first, there was a triumvirate running Russia
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.900]   as Lenin was recuperating from strokes.
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.300]   Then very quickly, well, not very quickly, but gradually,
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.140]   and then suddenly Stalin became an absolute dictator
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:38.220]   and he had a series of purges and so on and so forth,
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:41.860]   which solidified his control over the country.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:45.360]   - And of course, for Stalin, Trotsky later,
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.080]   but throughout, as you write,
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.200]   seemed to almost take on a supernatural character
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.920]   wherein everything that went wrong in the USSR
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.360]   was due not just to his views,
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.680]   but to his direct orders from abroad.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:03.080]   And of course, George Orwell, brilliantly,
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.840]   in probably my favorite book of his, which is "Animal Farm,"
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:09.920]   and also in 1984, portrayed Trotsky
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:14.920]   as Snowball in "Animal Farm" and Immanuel Goldstein in 1984,
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:18.580]   is this embodiment of this evil
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:20.340]   that we always have to be fighting.
[00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:24.340]   And you need that in order to hold on to power.
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:26.020]   You always have to have that enemy.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:28.580]   - Right, so that's something I talk about
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.180]   in "The White Pill" as well.
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.900]   When things start going wrong,
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.100]   they always have to have scapegoats, right?
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.940]   And there's this Russian anecdote.
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:37.180]   What the Russians like to do is
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.900]   you can't say things out loud,
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.960]   but if you make jokes, you can say unspeakable truths.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.120]   And there's this one anecdote where there's a Russian leader
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.600]   and things are going bad, and he looks in his drawer
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.760]   and there were two letters from his predecessor.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.560]   And he opens the first letter in a panic,
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:54.320]   and the letter says, for advice,
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.220]   and the letter says, "Blame everything on me."
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:57.460]   So he goes out there and he's like,
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:58.760]   "Oh, my predecessor sucked.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.520]   "He was terrible, blah, blah, it's his fault."
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.600]   And everyone's like, "Okay."
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.960]   And then there's a calamity again, and he's like, "Oh, crap."
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.420]   So he goes back at his desk and he reads the second one,
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.640]   and it says, "Sit down and write two letters."
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:13.460]   So when things start going wrong as they constantly did
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.180]   throughout the history of the Soviet Union,
[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:19.560]   or any totalitarian authoritarian country,
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.120]   it's someone has to be the blame.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:24.640]   Since we know that our ideology is true
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.080]   and scientifically true, if it's not working in reality,
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.300]   given the perfection of the ideology,
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.480]   someone must be intentionally undermining it
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:37.400]   and causing the disconnect between thought and reality.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.480]   And in the Soviet Union, there was the kulaks at one point,
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:43.240]   then it was the wreckers, the doctors,
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.480]   it was just different, the capitalists.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:48.280]   There was always someone, and Trotsky was called a fascist
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.240]   and was accused of plotting with Hitler
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.840]   and all this other stuff.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:54.420]   - And you also write, "The problem with communism
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:58.120]   "is that eventually you run out of possible scape boat."
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.200]   - Scape boats.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.720]   - Scape boats, you run out of boats.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.880]   - You do run out of boats.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.120]   - Who's gonna carry them?
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.360]   Eventually you run out of possible scape boats.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:14.440]   It's my second language, this English thing.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:19.680]   I'm a failed podcaster, I'm a failure.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.680]   Eventually you run out of possible scape boats for failure,
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.120]   at which point acknowledging or even noticing
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.400]   that something was wrong itself becomes a form of treason.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.320]   - Yeah, so I saw that in North Korea, right?
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.680]   Wherever you went in North Korea, something was wrong.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.760]   So if you have four buttons for the elevator,
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.800]   one would be mismatched, every wall had a crack,
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.480]   every floor had a stain, the bathroom would be rusted through
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.120]   when you wanted to flush the urinal.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.760]   But if you are someone who points this out,
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.840]   you're a troublemaker.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.080]   Oh, you're saying something's wrong,
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.480]   you're criticizing the operation.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.800]   First of all, you're threatening the person who's in charge
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.120]   'cause now they're incompetent
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.920]   and now that's a big red flag for them.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.840]   But second, if you're just going around saying,
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.480]   "This is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong,"
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.360]   even if it's objectively true,
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.640]   you're a troublemaker and you're a counter-revolutionary.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.600]   So at a certain point, everyone just has to put on blinders
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.480]   and pretend that everything is fine.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.880]   One example I use in the book, an extreme example,
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.120]   was there was a photography professor
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.140]   and he pointed out to his class, and he was an older man,
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.320]   that before the revolution,
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.480]   the quality of photographic paper was better.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.240]   And he was, I think, executed for this heresy.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.960]   So yeah, you have to pretend.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.800]   I'm reading a book right now
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.880]   about the Chinese Cultural Revolution
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.920]   and there was an academic,
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.480]   I forget his name, Hu Shi, I think,
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.480]   and he points out that in these countries,
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.540]   not only do you not have freedom of speech,
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:43.240]   you don't have freedom of silence.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.640]   You can't just sit there quietly.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.320]   You have to say how great things are
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.400]   and how much you're enjoying and how wonderful they are
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.880]   instead of just keeping quiet
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.040]   'cause if you keep quiet, that's suspicious.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.080]   - Yeah, those...
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.480]   - They're always singing those songs
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.480]   about how happy they are and how great everything is.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.380]   And if everyone else is singing, who are you to not sing?
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.060]   (silence)
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.860]   - Yeah, those pictures, especially when it's Stalin
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:11.060]   giving speeches and everyone's applauding,
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.300]   any dictator, you don't wanna be
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.900]   the first person that stops applauding.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.140]   - Stalin had to have a button, is my understanding,
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.980]   at a certain point to tell people to stop applauding
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.340]   'cause like you said,
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.900]   if you're the first one to stop clapping,
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:25.140]   people are gonna notice.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.220]   And why'd you stop clapping?
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.700]   You don't like Stalin?
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.500]   - But just imagine being one of those people clapping.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.940]   - But that's the thing.
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.900]   They always had a sword over their head
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.700]   but they all had a lot of blood on their hands too.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:40.060]   It's a very, very precarious life.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:43.840]   - But there's also, I mean, 1984 does a good job of this.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.860]   What is that, like two minutes of hate or something like this?
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:52.180]   You lose yourself in the hysteria of it.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.420]   So there's some level of which, at first,
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:59.700]   you're sacrificing your basic individualistic ability
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.420]   to think but then you get lost in this kind of wave
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:05.780]   of emotion and you give into it.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.060]   You allow yourself, it's like a mix of fear and then anger
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.940]   and then you direct that anger towards like Snowball
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.860]   or Trotsky or whoever the, and like, what is that?
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.500]   - You're also losing yourself in the crowd.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.340]   - Yeah, you're losing.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.540]   - 'Cause you're like, it's not just I'm angry,
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.180]   everyone I know, we're all angry together.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.620]   So you really are becoming a part
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.020]   of something bigger than yourself
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.340]   and having this kind of communal,
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:29.300]   very primal emotional experience.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.380]   It's like the opposite of Christmas, right?
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.840]   Christmas, we're all together, everyone's sharing their joy,
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.260]   everyone's sharing their love.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.180]   This is the opposite, literally the opposite.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.620]   Like everyone's together sharing their hate
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.860]   and anger and rage but you're all kind of having a mind meld.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:47.660]   - But I wonder what it's like to be an independent thinker
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:50.940]   in those moments, like allow yourself to think.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:53.300]   - Well, we know 'cause there were a lot of them
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.060]   and they were all punished enormously.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.460]   - So they can be noticed, you can notice them.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.100]   - Oh yeah, you even notice it in America.
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:01.140]   America's a free country,
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.340]   but when people start asking too many questions,
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.460]   it's like, where are you going with this?
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.900]   If you're in an office, even in a corporate setting,
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:12.300]   you're a troublemaker, you're making problems for everyone.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:13.760]   Why can't you be normal?
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.700]   Why can't you be just like everybody else?
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:20.340]   So people do not like having to be made to think
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.740]   and they certainly despise having to be made
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.860]   to justify themselves because that's a threat
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.140]   to their status and to their power
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.840]   and this applies in totalitarianism
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.400]   or applies to Dunder Mifflin.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:37.340]   - I still can't believe you're wearing lipstick.
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.180]   - I'm not.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:42.840]   - Goes to show you can pull lipstick on a pig.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.900]   (laughs)
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.060]   - It's like a snowball.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:55.380]   I think you've just been on a bender, that's what I think.
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:58.080]   - It's been rough, it's been rough, it's been rough.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:04.500]   I feel like I can be myself in this outfit.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.180]   I honestly feel like I could just go around in this outfit
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:12.180]   and just be weird 'cause everyone will accept you
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.180]   if you're wearing a Santa outfit.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:17.500]   You can say anything in a Santa outfit, right?
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.900]   - Have you seen "Bad Santa"?
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.140]   - Yeah, "Bad Santa," exactly.
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.660]   - You can't say anything.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:22.980]   My fuck stick.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.300]   How did Stalin come to power?
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:30.620]   If we return back to those early days,
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:35.060]   post-October Revolution, with Lenin and Trotsky and Stalin,
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.500]   how did he come to power?
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.220]   - So what Stalin did very cleverly,
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.740]   Stalin was, he worked the system,
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:44.780]   he was, but he was very much in the background
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.740]   and what he did better than Trotsky
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.380]   is he was much more of a politician.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:52.100]   He was a glad hander, he made friends within the party,
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.700]   he made people feel respected and appreciated
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.860]   and Lenin trusted him.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.220]   After Lenin's stroke, Stalin was basically the one
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.700]   who was keeping track of him.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.620]   Lenin asked Stalin at one point to kill him
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.300]   'cause after the strokes, he was incapacitated,
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.260]   Stalin talked him out of it, but at the same time,
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.460]   Lenin was like, "If I need someone killed,
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.260]   "this is who I need to talk to."
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.340]   Stalin, if you look at photos of him when he was young,
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.060]   he was a stud, he was a gangster, he was a bank robber.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.180]   So he basically worked the system
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.700]   and you had the Trotskyites on one hand
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.500]   who were much more to the left.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.660]   Stalin's big, I would guess, I would call it a heresy,
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:34.340]   was he put forth the idea of socialism in one country,
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.780]   whereas like, we're just gonna make it work here
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.140]   in what became the Soviet Union.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.300]   Trotsky idea, and this is really kind of the Marxist idea,
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:44.340]   is that the workers' revolution has to be worldwide.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.400]   This is just a worldwide kind of new era of humanity
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.380]   where Stalin's like, "No, no, no,
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:49.580]   "we're just gonna make it here,"
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:52.380]   and then later behind what became the Iron Curtain.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.780]   But this was, sure, this was an ideological division
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:59.900]   between the two, but what happens in totalitarian countries,
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.460]   it happens in any kind of like,
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:04.820]   when you have intermingling of religion and government,
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:08.220]   things that are ideological disputes,
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:09.220]   like the Aryan heresy.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:10.460]   The Aryan heresy in Christianity
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:13.060]   is that Christ is subordinate to God the Father, right?
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.860]   Whereas the contemporary Orthodox version,
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.020]   it's one God and three persons, excuse me.
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:21.380]   So they're all co-equal aspects of God and heaven.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:23.020]   But that was an excuse to be like,
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.720]   "You guys are evil, you're on the side of the devil,
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.560]   "we're gonna kill you."
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:29.720]   So these little disputes about ideas
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.780]   are often a convenient cover
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:34.500]   for people to have a power struggle
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.820]   in the guise of being like,
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.420]   "It's not that I'm about wanting to be more powerful,
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.380]   "I'm just on the side of the truth,
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.300]   "and you're speaking lies,
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.620]   "and that's dangerous to the revolution
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.940]   "or to the true faith."
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:45.380]   So he squeezed, but the thing is,
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:47.580]   Trotsky had the seeds of his own defeat
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:50.740]   because per Trotsky, the party is always right.
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.900]   You cannot be right against the party, right?
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.520]   So if you have this kind of party structure,
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.780]   and the party is saying, "You're wrong,"
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.280]   as an individual, you are wrong,
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.380]   'cause the collective is what makes decisions,
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:04.780]   the collective, the workers,
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:08.340]   are who have the knowledge and the information.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:13.180]   And it is important for you to kind of subordinate
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:16.500]   your selfishness, your individualism to this greater good.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:21.280]   So he kind of set himself up in many ways.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:26.380]   - Is it clear to you why Trotsky lost that power struggle?
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:28.860]   So you just explained that he set himself up,
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:31.140]   but you can see how different ideologies
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:35.300]   can be used to achieve different ends.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.300]   Is there another alternative possible trajectory
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.660]   where Trotsky could have been the head of the Soviet Union?
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.260]   - It would be very hard because he was Jewish.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.940]   So when they were seizing power,
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:48.820]   Trotsky explicitly said, "I can't be in charge, I'm Jewish."
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:52.380]   So the Soviet Union remained extremely anti-Semitic.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.820]   One of the reasons so many Jews became communists
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:57.020]   in the Soviet Union, because the promise was,
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.580]   once the communists took over,
[01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:59.980]   we're not gonna have pogroms anymore.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.900]   Pogroms was you had these Jewish ghettos,
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:06.340]   and under the permission or encouragement of the czar,
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.900]   just gangs of people go through killing, raping,
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.940]   robbing, stealing, rioting for days,
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.860]   and just a complete massacre.
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:15.820]   And the idea is like, under communism,
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:16.660]   everyone's gonna be equal,
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:17.780]   we're not gonna have this anymore.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.860]   They still had it, but to a lesser extent.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:24.860]   But since Trotsky was Jewish, his real name is Lev Bronstein,
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:29.420]   it was almost impossible to have a scenario
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.260]   where he was going to be in charge.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.300]   And Stalin fed into that to some extent.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:35.540]   Also this kind of idea of Jewish internationalism,
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.020]   it's like, okay, he doesn't really have loyalty to Russia.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.260]   And many of the people who were Jewish,
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:45.260]   who were high up in Stalin's government administration,
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:50.100]   they very much had to prove their loyalty to communism
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.340]   as opposed to Judaism.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.540]   - Throughout the 20th century,
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:56.580]   what was the relationship between communism
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.940]   and Jews in the Soviet Union?
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:04.020]   In terms of antisemitism,
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.580]   the ups and downs of antisemitism,
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:09.660]   it seems like it lessened, it was lesser and greater
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:12.420]   in different parts of the 20th century.
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:17.420]   - Well, it's the kind of thing where if something was bad,
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.100]   there's this Russian rhyme,
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:24.460]   like (speaking in foreign language)
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:26.740]   Like if there's no water in the sink,
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.060]   who drank it all, the Jews.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.460]   So if something goes wrong,
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.900]   there's just a convenient historical scapegoat,
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.100]   it's the Jews' fault.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:37.540]   So this is something that's towards the end of his life
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.700]   very much, and this was after World War II,
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.460]   Stalin was getting ready for another kind of series
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:43.420]   of programs there.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:46.700]   All these Jews were getting kicked out of their jobs,
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.900]   Jewish doctors were getting sent to the Far East
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.740]   instead of being in cities.
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:54.820]   The newspapers started talking about rootless cosmopolitans,
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.900]   which was a term the Nazis also used
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.500]   to kind of regard Jews as others or as aliens.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.020]   And this was going to be,
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:04.220]   and they were very clever about it.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:07.660]   In Pravda, and I talk about this in the "White Pill,"
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:11.140]   in Pravda, there were articles, letters to the editor,
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.620]   they were like, "You know,
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.820]   things are getting so anti-Semitic,
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.820]   we really should round up all the Jews
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.620]   and send them elsewhere for their own safety."
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:22.060]   So they were kind of setting the ground rules
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:27.060]   or the basis to have this sort of program come back,
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:30.860]   but spoiler alert, Stalin dies,
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:34.620]   and immediately all of this gets reversed
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:38.940]   and the new administration rehabilitates the doctors
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:40.500]   who were accused of trying to hurt him
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.140]   and all this other sort of thing.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:46.540]   - What is it about the scapegoats in society?
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.060]   Are we always going to be looking for scapegoats?
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.420]   What do you learn from human nature
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.060]   that this seems to keep happening?
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:55.720]   - I think there's a book called "The Nurture Assumption,"
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.660]   and I discuss this in the new right.
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:02.180]   And what the author learned is that humans
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.820]   define themselves by opposition.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:08.620]   So if you have a group of people and it's kids and adults,
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.260]   the kids will see themselves as kids
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.340]   'cause we're as opposed to adults.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.820]   If the adults leave,
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:16.100]   the kids see themselves as boys and girls,
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:17.460]   'cause I'm not a girl, I'm a boy,
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.900]   I'm not a boy, I'm a girl.
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.580]   So they divide.
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.100]   So this idea, which is a very lefty idea,
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.860]   that human beings naturally all get along is not accurate.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.980]   And the best example of this is, look after 9/11,
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:31.220]   look where there's a war.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.660]   Nothing unites a popular,
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.700]   it's not like when times are thriving
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:36.460]   that everyone's all working together.
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:38.660]   When things are bad and there's an enemy,
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:42.380]   the Japanese are Pearl Harbor, it's Al-Qaeda,
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:44.820]   that's when everyone really comes together
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.000]   'cause now we have someone to be against.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   So there will always be, someone has to be the outgroup
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.260]   and we have to be the ingroup as opposed to them.
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:13:00.260]   - But there's a viciousness to the actions you take
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:04.140]   towards the outgroup that varies throughout history.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:07.860]   Some, like the degree of viciousness can cross the line
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.180]   towards atrocities, towards genocide.
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.020]   - Right.
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:12.380]   - And that's the question of,
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:15.600]   why does it sometimes do that?
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.300]   Why does it sometimes cross into genocide?
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.760]   I understand it's a useful thing to have the other to blame
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.500]   in this world, especially when times are rough,
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:28.820]   but why does that sometimes lead to a sort of action
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:30.700]   that says I'm going to murder,
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:31.540]   I'm going to torture the other?
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:35.420]   - I think the question really is why sometimes it doesn't.
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:36.260]   - Right.
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.540]   - And one of the things I learned when I was doing
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:41.500]   the New Right is a lot of the Nazis,
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.260]   you use that term loosely speaking, neo-Nazis,
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.820]   they make the point that like, oh,
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:45.960]   when the Holocaust happened,
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.260]   it really wasn't that big of a deal
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.620]   and that only became a big deal in the decades later.
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.460]   And this just shows the power of Jewish influence.
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:55.140]   And I'm like, this to me is a great thing.
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:59.460]   It's a great thing that we sat down pretty recently,
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:02.260]   historically, and we're like, wait a minute,
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:06.580]   guys, when we have a war or we have conquest,
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:08.880]   you don't have to just start killing everyone.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.420]   Like this is something that's bad and wrong.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:15.340]   And certainly in the last 60 years, 70 years,
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.900]   this is something that people have come to take for granted,
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.100]   but that wasn't the case before.
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.700]   It would always be, or not always, but often,
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.140]   if you conquer, you just go wild
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:27.580]   and just start slaughtering masses of people.
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:31.620]   It's, who's the guy from Harvard?
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:33.100]   And he- - Steven Pinker.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.700]   - Steven Pinker, I'm sorry, I forgot his name.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:37.700]   So he just talks about like, we know,
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.740]   this is one of the reasons also why
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:43.000]   there was so much skepticism when the Holocaust started,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.560]   because this was regarded as something that was barbaric.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.020]   This is from the Middle Ages, from the biblical times.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.420]   We don't do this anymore, we're civilized now.
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:56.140]   So genocide is historically the norm.
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.980]   I think it's also harder to pull it off emotionally
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.060]   when you have the visuals and when you have the audio
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:06.220]   and when you have the voices of the people being slaughtered.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:09.620]   We don't know, if this was 2000 years ago
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.100]   and people in the Bible, like go kill this group,
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.820]   go kill that group, we don't have their names,
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:15.600]   we don't have the visuals, we don't have anything.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.320]   But when you see someone being like,
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.840]   there was a book about, I think the Rwandan genocide,
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.200]   and the title is, "We regret to inform you
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.720]   that tomorrow we will be executed
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.720]   with all of our families," like a telegram.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.640]   And like, when you get a telegram like this,
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.960]   it's very different than reading some history book
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.600]   about the Assyrians killed the Phoenicians.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.440]   It's like, I don't know who this is,
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.920]   I don't know who that is, right?
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:42.320]   So I think this is something that has changed very recently.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.560]   There was this kind of interesting moment
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.880]   just that speaks to the way technology
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.940]   has liberated people from violence.
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.680]   Kristallnacht, which was a moment
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.480]   in the lead up to the Holocaust,
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.520]   where basically, with Hitler's blessing,
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:02.080]   you had a nationwide burning of Jewish businesses,
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.800]   synagogues burnt down, and Kaiser Wilhelm, the Kaiser,
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.280]   he said, "For the first time in my life,
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.520]   I'm embarrassed to be a German."
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.680]   But that was a moment where worldwide,
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.200]   even plenty of people who did not think very highly
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:18.800]   of Jewish people were like, "This is a wrap.
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.880]   This is a complete nightmare."
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:23.480]   But 200 years ago, 100 years ago,
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.000]   maybe not literally at Kristallnacht,
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.320]   but there's an outgroup and we hate them
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.400]   and we're gonna kill 'em and it's fine.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.800]   - And you think it's even more difficult now
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.720]   with the internet to do that kind of thing?
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.480]   - Yeah, I'm not, now, more difficult doesn't mean
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.040]   it doesn't happen or it can't happen.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.480]   I'm not saying that at all.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.720]   But I'm saying that we know a lot
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.440]   about what's going on in North Korea,
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.320]   probably the most secretive country on earth.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.360]   There's a lot of atrocities in Eritrea,
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.560]   which is kind of known.
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.320]   So I think it's also, like, if you think about it,
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.320]   if you're how many years ago, 300 years ago,
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.960]   you only know the people in your village
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.120]   and they're all probably gonna look like you
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.320]   so on and so forth.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.600]   Whereas now, if I'm on social media
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.240]   and there's someone from any country
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.760]   and maybe their picture looks a little different,
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.800]   they use the same anime picture as somebody else,
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.040]   but they're putting forth their ideas,
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.560]   you do see the humanity in them
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.920]   and you do see a sense of familiarity
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.320]   and a familial bond with them.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.080]   And when you hear about these things,
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.520]   you know, when I, again, like I did when I did Dear Reader,
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.280]   no one, I was on Al-Qaeda and I was on Alex Jones,
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.240]   no one pushed back about like, oh, the North Koreans.
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.040]   They were all like, this is horrible.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.840]   If I had a magic wand, I'd give them food.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.240]   I wouldn't have them live in fear.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:39.000]   And this is something that I don't think was the case
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.520]   a couple of hundred years ago.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.560]   - That said, I'd love to get your thoughts
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:45.400]   about what's going on in Iran, the protests.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.280]   It seems like the regime there
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.240]   is able to crack down with violence.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.960]   - My thoughts about Iran, let me just,
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.520]   there's something else about Iran which I think is interesting
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.920]   this whole idea of care for what you wish for.
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.480]   Because people have this, and something I kind of,
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.160]   one of the reasons I have the white pill
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.160]   is Americans really are very naive
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.880]   about the nature of evil, right?
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.320]   They really think that a dictator has a weird mustache
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.080]   and he's banging the table and he's like a crazy person.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.720]   And it's often not the case.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.680]   But they also think if something is bad,
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.120]   therefore the alternative is gonna be better.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:25.280]   So you had the Shah of Iran and he was kind of authoritarian
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.480]   and no, he's not a good guy.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.040]   So in 1979, there were a lot of people like,
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.640]   this guy's horrible, he's oppressing the Iranian people,
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.520]   let's get him the F out of there.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.680]   He's so bad that whatever comes after it
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.320]   has to be an improvement.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.880]   And it's like, no, that's, if you think,
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.760]   I mean, this drives me crazy when conservatives are like,
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.080]   Joe Biden's the worst president we ever had,
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.520]   like this is destroying America.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:55.440]   I'm like, you have no idea how bad things can get.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.140]   The fact that you are in a position to complain
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.440]   means we got our ways to go.
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.160]   - Yeah, every time you say that Donald Trump
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.640]   or Joe Biden is the worst president ever,
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.000]   that warms my heart.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.480]   (Zubin laughs)
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.200]   Because you're allowed to say that.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.560]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:16.720]   - It's like, I just let it, it's like music.
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:19.440]   'Cause you're allowed to be pretty,
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.480]   in response to a president's tweet, you can write that.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.320]   - And it still lives there and nobody arrests you.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.520]   - Yeah.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.560]   - Which is a rare thing in human history.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.400]   - Yes.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.560]   - And still rare thing in the world.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:38.320]   I mean, it does seem that Iran, the current regime,
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.000]   is able to crack down on communication channels.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:41.840]   It's still,
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:47.840]   it's surprising to me how much power a government can have.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:51.680]   Like they could use violence to control the population.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.560]   - Right.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.140]   - And nobody's gonna do anything about it.
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:55.980]   - Well, I just--
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.800]   - The rest of the world just watches.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.080]   - But here's the thing, right?
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:03.280]   Because if the rest of the world starts doing too much,
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.840]   then they have a justification to crack down even more.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.520]   This regime, this protests are not legitimate.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:10.480]   These are, this happened constantly in the Soviet Union.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.560]   These are foreign provocateurs.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.200]   This is meddling in our country,
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:21.640]   curfew, lockdown, mandatory searches, everyone's a spy.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.720]   So that narrative is a very convenient one
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.320]   for people who are authoritarian.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.920]   I know a lot of people who are Persian,
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.000]   as I'm sure you do as well.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.120]   Very hardworking, very bright, great people.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:38.360]   And all you could do is hope
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.560]   for a peaceful liberalization of it.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.840]   But here's the, people don't realize
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.840]   how liberal Iran used to be.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.800]   Andy Warhol, Andy Warhol used to be friends with the Shah.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.360]   And if you read his diaries,
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.680]   he talks about how he knew things
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.920]   weren't going well for the Shah
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.840]   'cause they had less caviar at the table.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.920]   But like this is, he was really kind of,
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:03.800]   there's I think a poor understanding in America,
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.560]   and I'm not sure why,
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:09.760]   of what these liberal Muslim countries are like.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:12.440]   I gave a talk in Bodrum in Turkey,
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.600]   which is like a resort town in Turkey.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.160]   And I had thought previous to that,
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.160]   or I had suspected if push comes to shove
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.680]   and they have to choose people in Turkey
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.000]   between the West and like Al-Qaeda,
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.800]   not Al-Qaeda, but like, you know, hardcore Islam.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.000]   They're gonna choose hardcore Islam.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.240]   You go there and you're like, oh, this is like Los Angeles.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.280]   Like these people are so liberal,
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.040]   so, and they're the first to be killed.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.560]   They're the first targets.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.040]   So that, people like that in Iran are who my thoughts are.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.320]   And with the, I gotta tell you,
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:45.680]   like nothing makes me more of a feminist
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.480]   than seeing the women in countries like this
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.880]   fight for the right to education,
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.520]   the right to dress as they please.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.520]   Maybe we don't need them driving, but you know, that's okay.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:02.080]   - There he is with that characteristic brilliant humor
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.600]   that you're so loved for,
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.720]   and should probably be banned for on Twitter.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.840]   I'm doing my best.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.840]   Every time you tweet, I just report, report, report.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.640]   Please stop this man.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.320]   - You don't have like a script to just--
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.000]   - Exactly, well, actually, funny enough, I do.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.240]   But I don't abuse my power.
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:29.880]   I wear the ring like Frodo, and I respect the power.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.240]   - But you look like Gollum.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.920]   - That's not what your mom said last night.
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.040]   - She said you're hung like Gollum.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:42.720]   - I'm not going down that road with you.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.520]   I'm not holding hands another time.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.960]   I learned my, fool me once.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:52.280]   Okay, my close childhood friend is from Iran.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.120]   - Oh, wow, okay.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:57.160]   - And I talked to him a lot.
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.600]   I wanted to go to Iran.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.280]   - But it's so far away.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:05.280]   - I can see it from my house, my friend.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:09.760]   I would love to take that trip, even now.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:13.440]   It's just culturally, so all the different little pockets
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.320]   of local cultures that make up Iran.
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.200]   I just heard so many amazing things.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.280]   - Yeah, my friend Paul went there.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.360]   He had an amazing time.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.520]   He just absolutely loved it.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.120]   He thought the people were awesome.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.800]   It was so interesting, very developed.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.880]   Just like Tehran is, I mean,
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.800]   the history in Tehran is insane.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.400]   - Yeah, I would really love to visit.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.160]   Now we return back.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.720]   I don't know how we ended up in Iran,
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:42.760]   but let us stroll back to Stalin taking power.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.440]   What role did the suppression of speech,
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:50.400]   the censorship, the suppression of the freedom of the press
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.960]   have in Stalin taking hold, taking power?
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.200]   In Lenin, in Trotsky, in Stalin having power?
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.680]   - Well, it was a very useful mechanism
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:04.240]   to direct public opinion
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.200]   and inform public perspectives and everything.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.800]   So first of all, there was a lot of news
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.920]   about how great things were.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.680]   You have a bumper crop here.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.040]   Grains never better.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:19.680]   There's another anecdote where President Kalinin
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:24.680]   is talking about how on Karl Marx Street in Kharkiv,
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.600]   there's all sorts of new skyscrapers being built,
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.760]   and it's just absolutely amazing.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.320]   And some of the audience gets up and goes,
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.240]   "Comrade, I work on Karl Marx Street.
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.200]   "I walk there every day.
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.560]   "There's none of these skyscrapers."
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.040]   He goes, "See, that's your problem.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.020]   "You're trusting your eyes
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.520]   "instead of reading something and learning
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.760]   "what's in the papers."
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:43.400]   So there was this kind of disconnect between,
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:47.440]   I forget, you probably know the joke,
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.320]   like (speaking in foreign language)
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.480]   like "Pravda means truth,
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.720]   "but there's no truth to be had in Pravda"
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.240]   is like kind of the Russian line.
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.360]   The point is, it very much,
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.800]   and the other thing, this is,
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:01.000]   my mom wasn't particularly politically motivated,
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.760]   but she talked about how you didn't have to be smart
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.800]   to realize how dishonest it was,
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.240]   because one day, someone is the great hero
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.920]   of the Soviet people,
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:15.560]   and the next week, he's been a traitor
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.120]   and a class enemy and the worst.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.000]   And then sometimes they reverted,
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.400]   and it's like, okay,
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.960]   they couldn't even keep their story straight.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.280]   And in fact, at a certain point,
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.720]   when Gorbachev liberalized,
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.120]   they had to cancel tests
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:31.160]   because the history books had to be rewritten so quickly.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:36.240]   So, and the thing that also with these newspapers
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.080]   is there was a lot of,
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.840]   it was very monotonous,
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:42.680]   because you had the same message over and over.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.560]   A lot of these papers were about
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.480]   kind of speaking to the lowest common denominator,
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.640]   lowest common denominator,
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.640]   Stalin's great, everything's great,
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:50.920]   overseas bad.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.840]   So it very much was about not informing,
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.280]   but creating a certain perspective
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.920]   in the public at large.
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:05.080]   And also, you were educated as a citizen
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.600]   on what you're supposed to think and say.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.120]   So you have, a lot of this was this kind of
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:14.080]   private truths, public lies situation.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.760]   So you could read the paper and at your factory,
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.400]   you could be like, oh my God,
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:19.960]   this guy, Karl Radec, great.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.320]   He's like, oh my God, yeah, he's amazing.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.840]   You knew what to talk about,
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:25.960]   and you knew how to look at it as well.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.040]   And then when you get home,
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.680]   you could just kind of be more honest with family.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.520]   - But the question is,
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.400]   to which degree does this propaganda
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.720]   and this ideology infiltrate your actual thinking?
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:41.000]   You give examples of scientists infiltrated science.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:41.840]   - Oh yeah.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.880]   Basically, Lysenko is the textbook example,
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.480]   Lysenkoism in biology.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:50.440]   So because Marxism is materialist,
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.000]   they didn't like the idea that genes pass on
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.440]   from one generation to the next.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.960]   So Lysenkoism kind of was a rejection
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.200]   of Mendel and that kind of genetics.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:04.760]   And if you reject genes,
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.520]   you're really going in a bad direction in terms of biology.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.680]   The Soviet Union's biological program
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.200]   became an international laughingstock.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.960]   At one point, Lysenko claimed
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.640]   he crossed a tomato and a potato.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.400]   You had things where they said they had nuclear,
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.400]   which is, wait, we have fission,
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:24.200]   but they said they invented fusion or heavy water
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.680]   or hard water or whatever it was.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:29.600]   Point being, in cultures like this,
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.200]   your way to achieve status
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.360]   wasn't necessarily about your accomplishments,
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:39.120]   but about your loyalty to orthodoxy.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.080]   So if you were saying things that got to a result
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.080]   that was congruent with the broader ideology as a whole,
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.640]   that was much better as a means of furthering yourself
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:52.600]   in the arts or in the sciences
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.760]   than if you had something that was innovative,
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.160]   because if you're innovative, it's like,
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.560]   well, how do I fit this in
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.200]   with the broader ruling ideology?
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.400]   The problem with totalitarianism,
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.280]   one of the many problems, is everything,
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.560]   literally everything has to be perceived
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.520]   through the lens of ideology.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:13.520]   So, and that is, there were scientists who were arrested
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.880]   or at least fired because of their theories
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.120]   about sunspot developments,
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:19.960]   'cause it was regarded as un-Marxist.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   There was an epidemic and all these horses got sick,
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:28.680]   and because the vaccine didn't work on the horses,
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.440]   the bacteriologists were arrested,
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.640]   'cause they were regarded as wreckers.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.880]   It's like, we gave you a job, you didn't do it,
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.680]   you're undermining the socialist state.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:39.680]   So, it's kind of a backward series of incentives,
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:42.680]   and it's designed to maintain at all costs
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.960]   the ruling ideological superstructure.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.640]   - But you draw a small distinction
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:49.360]   between the ideology and the ideological superstructure
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:50.480]   and the propaganda.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.640]   Aren't those kind of intermixed together?
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.720]   - Well, the ideological's like in the sciences
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.080]   and what's true in genetics or what's true in astronomy,
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.040]   that doesn't really percolate out to the masses, right?
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.840]   So, the Pravda is maybe covering this scientist is great
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.380]   or these discoveries are great,
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:07.120]   but it's not necessarily the same as day-to-day
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.040]   or glorifying political leaders.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.480]   - But the Pravda is a manifestation of the idea
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:13.800]   that truth can be conjured up.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.640]   - Yes.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.720]   - It can be constructed and it can be altered quickly,
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:21.720]   and then, I just, I wonder, so 1984 caricatures that,
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:26.360]   I wonder to what degree it really could control
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.280]   the way you think.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.880]   That, like how many people it affected.
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.880]   - I can give you an example, a very easy one.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:36.240]   So, again, regarding North Korea.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.040]   Kim, the great leader Kim Il-sung,
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.940]   who was the founder of North Korea,
[01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:42.740]   had a tumor on the back of his neck
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:46.880]   and it was too close to the skull, the spinal column,
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.120]   so they couldn't operate on it,
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.220]   and throughout his life, it got bigger and bigger.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:53.060]   And I got mixed messages in my research
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:55.100]   about whether North Koreans knew about it
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:57.860]   because they always photographed him from this angle.
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:01.820]   And I met a refugee and I asked him,
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:03.580]   "Did you know that he had this tumor?"
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.380]   She goes, "Yeah, yeah, when people played him in the movies,
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.340]   "they would, you'd make up there."
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:10.040]   And she goes, "It was an old war injury."
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:12.920]   And I go, "Why would a war injury get bigger
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:13.920]   "throughout your life?"
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:16.420]   And she just stood there and she was like,
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:18.700]   "Holy," but she never questioned it,
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:19.540]   but it was the kind of thing
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.100]   where they put the idea in her head,
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:22.660]   and since there was no reason to question it,
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:24.580]   she just kind of went with it her entire life
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:26.580]   until I talked to her, Audrey, her name.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:28.980]   Hi, Audrey.
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:30.180]   - Hi, Audrey.
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:32.500]   I wonder what percent of the population is like that.
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.100]   - Here's the thing.
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:37.700]   If there's a cost to me questioning Lysenko
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:40.340]   as a great scientist and there was no benefit,
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.760]   why wouldn't I just go with what's going
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.900]   to keep me and my family safe?
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.580]   - But I also mean just the psychological.
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:52.340]   There might be a very local psychological cost.
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:53.580]   So not a cost you're going to jail,
[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:57.280]   but a cost like you're gonna kind of ruin the conversation
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:59.380]   by bringing it up, kind of like--
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:00.220]   - Yeah.
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:02.020]   - I'm just trying to--
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:03.060]   - It's like Debbie Downer, right?
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.340]   Wah, wah. - Yeah.
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:05.980]   - But there's also the whole metaphor
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:07.260]   of like there's two fish in the river,
[01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:09.340]   one says, "Man, the water's really great today,"
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:10.860]   and the other one goes, "What's water?"
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:13.420]   Like a friend of mine, Adriana,
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:16.900]   her mom came to the West and they went to a supermarket,
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:18.700]   and the mom just in front of all the Fanta,
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:20.940]   this is just crying.
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:21.820]   And she's like, "What's going on?"
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:24.940]   She goes, "They told us we had more food than you."
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:29.940]   And when something is, you can under think this story,
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:33.540]   this guy's an enemy of the people, he was the hero,
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:36.100]   he just offended someone, this is bullshit.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:38.820]   It's almost impossible psychologically
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:42.140]   to think I'm living in "The Truman Show,"
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:47.100]   and that everything in the media is not just wrong,
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:50.100]   but a carefully constructed narrative and a lie.
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:51.940]   Like what, they're never gonna tell the truth?
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:54.280]   And how are you, you know, like what?
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.860]   And even if you do understand that,
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:58.420]   how would you even read between the lines
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:31:59.900]   to deduce what the truth is?
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:02.020]   - Yeah, it must've been a strange experience.
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:03.820]   There's stories of soldiers,
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:06.660]   the Red Army soldiers throughout World War II,
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:09.380]   as they go to different countries, even Romania,
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:13.300]   but in Europe, just to understand
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:16.460]   that people live much better than they did,
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:18.300]   than the soldiers did back in the Soviet Union.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:19.860]   - And that's why a lot of times when they went back,
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:21.980]   Stalin had them killed because they saw too much
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.020]   or sent to the camps.
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.160]   (sighs)
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:28.440]   - So just to linger on this idea of free speech.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:32.160]   So there's constant discussion about free speech
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.960]   in this modern debate about social media
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:34.800]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.200]   What's your take on it?
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:41.520]   Grounding it, not in some kind of shallow discussion
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.600]   of free speech we have today,
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.600]   but more in the context of Pravda
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:52.560]   and the suppression of speech in Stalinist Russia.
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.380]   - I hate the term free speech
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:57.420]   because it's used in many different contexts.
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:00.220]   Some I agree with entirely, some I disagree with at all.
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:04.540]   I don't think everyone has something to say
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:07.300]   or something to add to the conversation.
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:12.300]   And I have my locals community and it used to be,
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.540]   I think the boilerplate language is,
[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:17.160]   come support free speech and free discourse.
[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:20.440]   And I changed that because I don't like that term.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.780]   Because people will tell you with some reason
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:25.740]   that, oh, if you block me on Twitter,
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:27.620]   you're voiding my free speech.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:28.460]   It's like, all right.
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.760]   So I don't like that term as a whole.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.180]   But one of the points of the white pill
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:36.420]   and something I see enormous parallels with today,
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:41.420]   if you have one news outlet or three news outlets
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:44.500]   with identical ideology,
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:49.220]   you're not going to be able to get to any kind of truth
[01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:50.760]   or any kind of useful information.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:52.220]   It's all gonna be pre-filtered for you.
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.400]   It's like a baby bird
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.820]   and you're eating the mother bird's vomit, right?
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:59.600]   But if you have what we have increasingly now
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.040]   with technology,
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.360]   if you have a world where everyone has a camera
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.500]   on their phone,
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.280]   if you have a world where anyone
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.040]   can put their ideas out there,
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.520]   maybe they're banned from certain outlets,
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.340]   but they're not literally vanished
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:14.200]   like they were in the USSR,
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.540]   that is very healthy.
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:18.800]   That is something I'm enormously supportive of
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.620]   because back in the day,
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:24.080]   if you only had the TV crews with cameras,
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.420]   you can only see what they're capturing
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:27.760]   and they could edit it.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.520]   Whereas now, we saw this recently during COVID, right?
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:36.760]   You had these reporters with masks on and they're talking,
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.320]   but the cameraman wasn't wearing a mask.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.120]   So you'd have the people on the street being like,
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.680]   look, they don't believe it.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.440]   Or as soon as they would start filming,
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.040]   the guy took the mask off and they'd film them.
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.160]   And they go, you are lying.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.320]   You don't believe this.
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.000]   You're putting this on for some purpose,
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.900]   whether you're leaving the efficacy of masks or not.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:55.120]   That person clearly does not,
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.400]   is only putting on for show.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.080]   So that's, or crimes.
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.840]   It's people are anti-police.
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:04.440]   They say, okay, the cop said this.
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.400]   Did he draw the gun in the sky necessarily?
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.440]   So on and so forth.
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:11.780]   It is so much better when everyone has access
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:14.360]   to as much of the information as possible
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.440]   and can make that informed decision themselves.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:21.000]   Now there certainly is space for informed people
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:21.840]   to be like, no, no, no, no.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:22.980]   This isn't what it looks like.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:24.640]   If you look here, if you look there,
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.600]   it's cropped here, so on and so forth.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.660]   But that's still much more useful
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:32.160]   than just having that 20 second clip
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.960]   that someone has decided to edit for you.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.600]   - So like truth has a way of,
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:39.040]   because everything is so interconnected,
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:40.120]   truth, no matter what,
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.600]   has a way of finding its way to the populace.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:47.240]   And also there's a big asymmetry in terms of trust.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:52.040]   So if I tell you a hundred truths and one lie,
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.780]   that lie is equal, I'm screwed.
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:56.620]   'Cause once you catch me in a,
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:57.800]   you don't have to kill someone every day
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:58.680]   to be a murderer, right?
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.880]   You only have to do it once.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:03.240]   So if you catch me in a brazen lie,
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.160]   you're gonna look at everything I say after that
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.160]   with an enormous grain of salt.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.480]   So that is another big asymmetry in favor of truth.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:13.760]   If someone trusts you, you have to be honest all the time
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.320]   and you're gonna make mistakes.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.520]   You can own those mistakes and be like,
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.240]   "Hey, this is why I made the mistake.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.880]   This is why I said such and such."
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.280]   - Okay, but the flip side of that,
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:24.000]   which has been disheartening to me,
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.680]   is that people on the conspiracy side,
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.380]   conspiracy theory side of things,
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:33.200]   I've noticed how easy it is to just call something a lie.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.280]   - Yes.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:36.040]   - And then that becomes viral.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.800]   For some reason, there's a desire for people,
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.280]   yeah, for anyone who points out
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:41.640]   that the emperor's not wearing a clothes,
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.640]   even when the emperor is fully clothed.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.040]   So I don't know what that is,
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.960]   but that really seems to mess with this truth mechanism.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.700]   So when it becomes viral to call people a liar,
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:54.600]   whether they're a liar or not,
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:58.080]   it's like you feel like on unstable ground
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:02.300]   because to me, that idea of revealing a lie
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:04.600]   that somebody told is a really powerful mechanism
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.920]   to keep people honest.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.760]   But when you're misusing it, crying wolf too much,
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.600]   it seems to break the system.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:14.200]   It makes me nervous because there's also like--
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:16.320]   - But just, if someone is a liar,
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.680]   that doesn't mean literally everything they say is a lie.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.520]   - No, but what is a lie and what isn't?
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:23.200]   I just noticed that there's money to be made
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:25.500]   in calling out something as a lie.
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:31.200]   It's just the conspiracy theories, straight up.
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:35.840]   The first thing, some traumatic event happened,
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:38.440]   give an explanation that's not the mainstream explanation.
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.480]   No matter what, whether it's true or a lie,
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:43.920]   there's a lot of virality and money to be made in that.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:45.580]   And that makes me nervous
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:48.120]   because it doesn't matter if it's true or not.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:51.680]   It becomes anti-establishment ideas are viral,
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.360]   whether they're true or not.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.440]   - Sure, but I think establishment ideas are powerful
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.800]   whether they're true or not.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:37:59.760]   So I think--
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.600]   - On the whole, I think you're right.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.460]   On the whole, it's good to test the power centers,
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:09.460]   but it just makes me nervous in our attention economy
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:12.860]   that the sexy thing seems to be
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:15.180]   the anti-establishment message.
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:18.080]   And then it feels like that becomes a drug
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.680]   where you, everything, anything the establishment says,
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.200]   anything institutions say,
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:26.140]   anything the mainstream says must be wrong
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:27.500]   because it comes from the mainstream.
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.920]   - I have that line that you're supposed to take one red pill
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.620]   not the whole bottle.
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:36.140]   I am certainly one of those people who is of the idea
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:39.480]   that they are dishonest by more open that they're honest.
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.540]   That said, there are people who are of the belief,
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:45.060]   to use an extreme example,
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:47.480]   that Trump is still the shadow president.
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:51.160]   And there's gonna be these QAnon mass arrests.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.300]   I thought this was something that like the Daily Beast
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.640]   made up to make fun of MAGA,
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:58.540]   but I was just in the phone with my buddy last night
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:00.380]   and he was like, "No, no, if you go to Truth Central,
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:01.320]   "they're like all over there.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.440]   "And if you disagree with them, they call you
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:06.180]   "controlled opposition or a grifter or so on and so forth."
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.780]   - Is it on 4chan or where?
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:10.340]   - Truth Central, Trump's social media outlet.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:12.660]   - Oh, Truth, no, Truth Central.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:14.980]   - Yeah, but he forgot the name of it himself.
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:16.660]   So he's like, "That's why I had to create a joke."
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:18.060]   - You gotta explain the jokes.
[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:19.020]   You gotta explain the jokes.
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:22.300]   You do like the way Twitter puts that context.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:24.860]   You gotta do the joke and then pause
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:27.100]   and like turn to the camera and explain.
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:28.260]   - And have a laugh track.
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:29.980]   But yes, so people know where the jokes are.
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:31.160]   That's real humor.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.780]   - Yeah, and then we just clap.
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:35.080]   - And then everybody clap.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:40.540]   I think for the last two years, especially vis-a-vis COVID,
[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:44.080]   the overwhelming message was the experts know
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.500]   what they're talking about.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:48.920]   And if you are questioning this, you're a Vax denier
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.900]   and you basically should be read out of polite society.
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:54.520]   And one obvious counter example to this
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:56.220]   was social distancing.
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:58.720]   If social distancing was efficacious,
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.920]   why were there no attempts ever to bring it back, right?
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.200]   When you had different waves.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:07.100]   And if it wasn't efficacious, why was it so insistent
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.320]   that we do it, all do it at the very beginning?
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:11.360]   In fact, in many places, you'll still see the signs
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360]   on the floor where it's six feet apart.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.620]   So there's an incongruity there.
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:19.360]   And I think we are forgetting as a people,
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:22.660]   the intensity with, and understandably to some extent,
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.320]   if you have this worldwide deadly plague,
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.840]   like it's gonna be go where the leakiest hole is.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.320]   So you really gotta kind of get everyone on board.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:33.480]   But to the vehemence with which we're told,
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:34.920]   we know what we're doing.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.440]   This is the way to solve it.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.120]   If you don't do it, you're causing mass death.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:44.440]   That I think fed in very heavily to people's enormous sense
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:47.640]   of skepticism toward establishment sources.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.920]   - Speaking of the plague, you opened the book with--
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.440]   - Oh, yeah, that quote from Camus.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.160]   - It's a strong, strong quote.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.560]   - Camus brings me to tears.
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:57.000]   And it's funny 'cause I reread "The Myth of Sisyphus,"
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.320]   which I had been recommending to people.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.600]   I'm like, this book is not good.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:02.520]   But he's got, his ethos is my favorite
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:03.440]   of all the philosophers.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:06.080]   - It sounds like "The Myth of Sisyphus" was a myth.
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:10.100]   - He says-- - Laugh track, cute.
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:13.200]   - All I maintain is that on this earth,
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.700]   there are plagues and there are victims.
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:18.160]   And it's up to us so far as possible
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:20.840]   not to join forces with the plagues.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:24.480]   And why I have that as the introductory quote to the book
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:27.720]   is I think morality and ethics
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.140]   are very, very complicated subjects.
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:32.320]   There's lots of gray areas where you don't know
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:33.920]   which way to choose.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.680]   But at a base level, he has another quote
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:38.820]   that's ascribed to him he never actually said,
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:42.040]   but something about, is the duty of thinking people
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.760]   not to be on the side of the executioners.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:48.200]   If you are, we should do whatever we can
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.360]   not to have blood on our hands,
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.560]   not to be murderers, not to want death.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:58.040]   And that in and of itself is a big pill
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:59.420]   for a lot of people to swallow.
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:04.420]   We're all brought up, taught that war is a last resort.
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:07.560]   And yet when it comes to international affairs,
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.880]   it's always often a first priority
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.920]   and people are champing at the bit
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.920]   to start going in and killing people.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:17.080]   And what war means isn't good guy soldiers
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.080]   versus bad guy soldiers.
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:21.400]   My concern is always with the civilians,
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.960]   with the kids who become orphans,
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.040]   with the wives who become widows and things like that.
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.060]   And then communities which are ruined forever.
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:32.440]   So I love that quote of his.
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.680]   I mean, the book started,
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:38.320]   it was going to be a recontextualization of Camus' thought.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.920]   I was gonna rip off my old buddy, Ryan Holiday,
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.280]   what he did with the Stoics and do about Camus.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.680]   And then when I started rereading Camus,
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:48.340]   I'm like, oh, I've read more into him than is really there.
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.480]   And then it went into a whole other direction.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:53.080]   - So you wanted to do almost
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:57.120]   like an existentialist manifesto.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:00.360]   So like one must imagine Sisyphus happy?
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.280]   - Well, more like Camus for today
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.120]   and what his philosophy can teach us,
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.920]   like Ryan did with his many books about the Stoics.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:11.600]   And it was gonna be called "The Point of Tears."
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.880]   - Live to the Point of Tears?
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:15.360]   - Yes, but the title was gonna be "The Point of Tears."
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.800]   - No, I know, but from that line.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.200]   - Man must live to the-- - That's a good line, right?
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.020]   He has so many good lines.
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:20.940]   - Yeah.
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:21.780]   - Maybe it's not about--
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:23.160]   - Probably shitty in bed though, right?
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:25.000]   - Well, no, he was a big Lothario.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.400]   He was probably pretty good. - What's Lothario mean?
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.380]   - He got around.
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:32.140]   What?
[01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:34.460]   - What percent of the audience of humans on Earth
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:36.400]   do you think know the word Lothario?
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.700]   - What percent of them have a computer?
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.160]   Look it up.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.060]   - Lothario.
[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:42.880]   - It's not some weird term. - Lothario.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.820]   - L-O-T-H-A-R-I-O, Lothario.
[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:45.900]   - Lothario.
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:48.320]   A man who behaves selfishly in a response
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:50.720]   to being in sexual relationships with women.
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:53.080]   They're seduced by a handsome, in quotes,
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.640]   they're seduced by a handsome Lothario
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:57.080]   who gains control of their financial affairs.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.920]   - Oh, I didn't think, I always thought of his more
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.800]   as just someone who's like a stud.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.400]   - Like a player, but no. - Yeah, a player, yeah.
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:04.480]   - There's a malevolent--
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.520]   - Oh, I didn't realize that, okay.
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:06.640]   Well, then he's-- - Selfishly.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.680]   - Okay, that's not him.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:10.300]   - Irresponsibly, and a man too.
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:14.920]   Although Ayn Rand would be proud, selfishly.
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:16.020]   - Well, no, no. - What's wrong with selfish?
[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:17.860]   - She wouldn't like that kind of selfishness.
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:19.460]   That's exploitative. - Behaves,
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.900]   a man who behaves selfishly and irresponsibly
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:24.900]   in his sexual relationships with women.
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:29.580]   Huh, yeah, okay, so he was just a player.
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:31.140]   - No, not a, maybe a stud.
[01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:32.780]   I don't think he was promiscuous particularly.
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:35.000]   - Nietzsche didn't get, he got,
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.220]   he didn't never got laid, right?
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.620]   - He had syphilis, he died of syphilis.
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:39.220]   - Oh, like the, it was from prostitutes.
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.820]   - Was it, okay, possibly, yeah.
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:42.380]   - You're asking me like I knew the guy.
[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:46.960]   I heard it's from, he never had a deep,
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.440]   loving, fulfilling relationship.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:49.840]   He had a very skewed understanding
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.680]   on the way he wrote about women.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.560]   Although somebody wrote to me and said
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.000]   that's a mischaracterization,
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.760]   that he was actually very respectful of women.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.600]   - Yeah, but he had that line,
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:01.380]   if you're going before a woman, bring a whip.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:02.220]   Wasn't that him or did that show up in her?
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:05.500]   - If I were to quote you from your Twitter,
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:08.640]   I think I could make a very convincing argument
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:12.120]   that you're sexist, racist, and probably a Nazi.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.360]   - Well, I do own like some of Hitler's stuff.
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:16.540]   - Exactly.
[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:17.380]   - I got the--
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:20.180]   - I rest my case.
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.840]   - I feel like I'm a Nuremberg.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.520]   (laughing)
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:26.360]   I'm gonna be hung by his own tie.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.920]   This isn't a tie, it's a noose.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:31.120]   - You should have thought about that
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.520]   when you were saying all those things.
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:37.520]   Okay, what do you think of the leak of the Twitter files?
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:42.520]   - I was so happy that Elon gave the information
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:49.840]   to Matt Taibbi and Barry Weiss,
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:52.720]   who are both, by any metric, lefties,
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:55.120]   who are both professional journalists
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:58.680]   of longstanding with great resumes,
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.520]   and overnight now they're doing PR for the world's,
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.520]   which all the way to the party line was,
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:07.400]   the fact that you had all these corporate journalists
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.320]   now having to play catch up
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:11.920]   and not having control of the microphone,
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.840]   to me, was just absolutely amazing.
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:20.320]   I think transparency is what brought down,
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:22.360]   in many aspects, the Soviet Union,
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.640]   and what will bring down what negative aspects
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:27.000]   of the regime we have here.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:31.040]   When you see the machinations behind the scenes,
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:34.600]   and then when you see the rationalizations after the fact,
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:37.600]   you realize, oh, these people are not acting in good faith.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:40.920]   The fact that, for example, the New York Post article
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:44.160]   about the Hunter Biden laptop,
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.120]   and how the New York Times covered it as well,
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.200]   they didn't mention any kind of dick pics,
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:52.040]   Twitter made it so I couldn't even DM you
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:53.760]   the link to the New York Post article,
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:56.800]   which was a tool they had previously used only
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:59.800]   to prevent child pornography.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:03.960]   So that shows to what extent they were willing
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:06.660]   to put their thumb on the scale,
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:11.480]   but it also shows that for any layman,
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.520]   when they're looking at this,
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:17.520]   to realize what you are perceiving as news or information
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:22.600]   is very much sculpted, edited, and guided
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.320]   by powerful people who have a vested interest
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:28.900]   in maintaining their power.
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:30.360]   - I think, to me, the important lesson
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.160]   is this is not a left or right thing.
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.000]   - Oh, not at all.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.920]   Power versus powerless, yes.
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.200]   - And also the important lesson there,
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.280]   I think at least in the case of Twitter,
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:43.100]   in our society, it's a slippery slope.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:44.880]   You don't get there overnight.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:47.700]   You start using those tools a little bit,
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:50.320]   a little bit to slow down misinformation,
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.520]   to just a little bit,
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.880]   you start sending emails to each other a little bit,
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:57.520]   and it becomes more and more,
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.680]   you start forming justifications,
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.520]   you start getting a little more and more comfortable
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:05.160]   kind of talking about this stuff.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.760]   I think there are several ways to fight that.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:10.880]   One is having hardcore integrity up front,
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.040]   so don't even open the door.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:15.720]   But I think realistically, human nature is what it is,
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:18.560]   and so I think the only way is through transparency.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:23.400]   I hate the fact they got politicized.
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:26.320]   I really hate that the right have run with it,
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:29.520]   like, look, the left is planning the rigged elections
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:30.360]   and so on.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:32.400]   To me, it shouldn't be left or right,
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:33.440]   it shouldn't be about politics,
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.520]   it's that transparency's good.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.080]   Other companies should do the same.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.360]   Facebook should do the same.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.840]   And in fact, that transparency will protect Facebook.
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:44.000]   It will protect Google.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.320]   Look, this is our situation, tell us what to do,
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.440]   and we'll do our best.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:50.840]   - I remember when I was writing "The New Right,"
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.000]   Twitter's line was, "We're not gonna tell you guys
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.640]   what the metrics are by which we ban or censor people,
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:02.120]   because then bad actors are gonna navigate around them."
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.240]   And it's like, what are you doing?
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:07.560]   Like, just tell people in any establishment
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:10.840]   what are the rules for which behavior is permissible.
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:13.720]   If I go to a store, if I return the sweater,
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:16.560]   is it cash back, no refunds, or if I get store credit?
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:17.400]   You know what I mean?
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:19.520]   So that they were having this place
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:23.280]   which was presented as a huge
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:25.440]   international space for public discourse,
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:27.280]   and they're not telling you ahead of time,
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.760]   this is what we will tolerate,
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.000]   this is what we'll warn you about,
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.640]   this is what will kick you out overnight.
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:35.120]   That to me was crazy and outrageous.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:39.280]   And I'm really pleased with to what extent Elon
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.680]   is being open with their policies.
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:48.120]   And what I really wanna commend him about is,
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:49.360]   now I'm triggered,
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:53.400]   because one of the things that he took over,
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.360]   he's like, "Our first priority is getting rid
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.320]   of child pornography and child exploitation."
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:58.160]   - Yeah, yeah. - Right?
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.360]   That was, he's like, "Racial slurs, homophobic slurs,
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.040]   anti-Semitic slurs, yeah, yeah, that's cool.
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.800]   Kids getting harmed is number one."
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:09.280]   And he fired the old task force
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:10.880]   'cause they weren't doing their job.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:12.160]   Eliza Blue, who you know,
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:14.800]   she had been on this for a long time,
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.920]   but people who were victims of child pornography,
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:19.200]   child exploitation, were emailing Twitter being like,
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.440]   "These are my images, get them off."
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:23.440]   And they're like, "Too bad, porn is allowed on Twitter."
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:25.000]   He starts trying to crack down on it,
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.640]   this is a very hard problem
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:30.120]   because these bad actors have mechanisms
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:32.400]   to evade being banned.
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.840]   They wanna get their,
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.960]   for lack of a better term, product out there.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:40.760]   Forbes Magazine, who is an agent of the devil,
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.640]   had a tweet and they tweeted this nine times.
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:45.520]   You know, now that Elon's here,
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:49.160]   Twitter's child porn nightmare has gotten much worse.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:50.680]   They tweeted this nine times.
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:53.160]   I looked up, anyone listening to this can look up,
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.800]   look at Forbes and do a search.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:56.960]   They never mentioned this problem before.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:59.280]   So now that Elon is doing something about it,
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:00.280]   now it's a problem for you.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:02.160]   No, it's a problem, Elon's the problem.
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:04.960]   It's not the child porn that you guys had a problem with.
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:06.760]   And that to me is like, yeah,
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:10.560]   I understand that you think that Elon is a bad guy
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.440]   'cause he's upset your Apple cart.
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.320]   This isn't a political issue.
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:15.680]   This isn't a gotcha moment.
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:19.200]   This is, all right, here are some tips.
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:22.600]   We talked to 10 experts, digital experts,
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:25.600]   and here are some techniques, Mr. Musk,
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:28.600]   that you might wanna take from us free of charge
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:29.720]   that will help you solve this.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.640]   That would be a great article.
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:33.360]   - And I just wanna use this opportunity
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:35.920]   to say quite clearly and strongly
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:38.840]   that even though Twitter and other parts of the internet
[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:40.560]   are interpreting some of my statements
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:43.320]   to mean I'm right, in this case,
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.440]   meaning leaning right, right wing,
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.800]   and in other cases, leaning left, left wing,
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:49.440]   I'm not, I'm apolitical,
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:51.800]   or at least I try to be in my thinking.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.280]   Take one issue at a time.
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:55.320]   I do take an opinion on each issue at a time,
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:56.520]   but I hate camps.
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:00.000]   I try to avoid political camps in general.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.000]   It just, it sucks that promoting transparency in this case
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.920]   or celebrating transparency
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:12.360]   is somehow connected to being right wing.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:17.280]   - No, it's being made into a supposed euphemism
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:18.440]   for being right wing.
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.160]   - It's just, it sucks.
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:24.360]   It sucks, even though I'm wearing a red suit
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:27.080]   and this is a very red-themed conversation.
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:30.240]   - Well, I mean, the revolution was the color of blood.
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:38.400]   - I'm just gonna let it sit on that for a second.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.480]   Okay, you mentioned New York Times Best Seller list.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.840]   You chose to self-publish.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:43.680]   - Yes.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.800]   - Can we just linger on that decision?
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:48.200]   What are the pros and cons of self-publishing?
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:52.200]   - The cons are it is acceptable
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:56.160]   in our current business climate or cultural climate
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:58.320]   for corporate media outlets
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:00.240]   to pretend the book doesn't exist.
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:01.080]   - Yeah.
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:03.560]   - So basically, and there's reason for it.
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:06.320]   I can make the case to them pretty easily.
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:09.240]   If someone's doing it themselves, who is this guy?
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:11.240]   It's some crackpot writing crazy stuff
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:12.360]   from his basement, right?
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:13.720]   It's a little different, I think, for me,
[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:15.600]   'cause I'm an established author.
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:17.760]   C-SPAN gave me an hour on Book TV.
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:19.800]   - It's still a crackpot, but yeah, established.
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:21.200]   - For Dear Reader, I think I was the first one
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.520]   to get an hour on Book TV for a book that I did myself.
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.360]   So there is space for that.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.120]   It didn't go through a vetting process
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:33.320]   the way a book going through a corporate publisher did.
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.640]   So those are the minuses.
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:40.640]   The pros are I can drop it and publish it immediately.
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:44.520]   If you go through a corporate publisher,
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:45.720]   you have to wait a year.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:49.320]   You can have the book you want
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.480]   instead of getting past the editor.
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:53.080]   And some editors are very, very good,
[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:54.200]   and there's a whole spectrum.
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:55.400]   Some of them, not so good.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:57.400]   Some are good, some are not so good.
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:53:59.600]   I know the best, the real killers.
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:02.000]   - All right, there's good people on both sides.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000]   - Yeah, there's plenty of good people on both sides.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.320]   And I don't mean the white nationalists
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:06.560]   who I condemn totally.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:10.840]   But the thing is, in terms of money,
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:14.920]   you get six times as much profit when you self-publish
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.120]   than when you go through a corporate publisher.
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:18.600]   The buck stops here.
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:20.840]   In one of my books that I co-authored,
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:22.240]   I won't even mention the name,
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:25.000]   there is a typo and they don't care.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.400]   They didn't fix it for the paperback edition.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:29.520]   Here, since I'm going through Amazon,
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:32.200]   if there's a typo, I can fix it live and it updates.
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:33.040]   - Oh yeah? - Yep.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:34.240]   - You can just update it. - Yeah.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:35.080]   So that's very useful.
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.560]   - You can do like a Fight Club thing
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:39.920]   where you can insert a dick pic in one of the pages.
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.880]   - Okay, why are you so,
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:44.560]   why do you keep texting me to send you dick pics?
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:45.760]   - I didn't know. - Talk about no response.
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:47.160]   - Justin, you're, all right, all right.
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:48.840]   - All right, I get it. - That's why I'm not the editor.
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:50.600]   - I get it, North Pole, I get it.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:51.440]   - Yeah.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:55.480]   - The other advantage, just socially,
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:57.400]   is I think people are,
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:54:59.960]   like I found this with the Kickstarter I did for Dear Reader,
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:03.840]   people are much more excited to buy it and promote it
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:06.640]   and talk about it when they know you're doing it yourself
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:08.560]   instead of you're getting a big check
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.280]   from St. Martin's, HarperCollins, Penguin, whatever.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:14.040]   - Are you also trying to use some kind of service
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:16.040]   to get it distributed to bookstores
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:17.480]   or are you just going to do Amazon?
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:19.000]   - No, just Amazon, yeah.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.440]   - And that's probably where most sales happen.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.480]   - The vast majority, yeah.
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:24.240]   So it's not gonna be in bookstores.
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:27.600]   - So how difficult is the process of getting it on Amazon?
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:30.640]   - So I'll tell you a funny story about how Amazon works
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:33.100]   and 'cause this was,
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:36.160]   I always planned for, because everyone,
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:40.320]   people's, here's another piece of advice I will give people.
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:42.080]   Your life will be a lot easier if you realize
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.720]   that the majority of people in every industry
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.800]   are bad at their jobs.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:46.360]   Like once you have that realization,
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:47.520]   everything else makes sense
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:49.680]   and your life will be a lot easier, right?
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.200]   So when I did the "Anarchist Handbook,"
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:52.720]   which was a collection of essays
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:54.880]   from various anarchists throughout history,
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.520]   when I submitted it to Amazon,
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:00.480]   there was a lot of copyright issues
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:02.240]   'cause they're like, do you have the rights to this essay?
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:03.280]   Do you have the rights to this essay?
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:05.400]   I had to go back and forth with them a lot
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:07.440]   to make sure I had copyright
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:09.040]   where everything was public domain.
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:11.880]   And the thing is you forward it, you update it,
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.840]   you give them the information, three days,
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.480]   there's another problem, it's not three days, so it's weeks.
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.480]   The other thing with their CreateSpace program
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:23.480]   is the paperback and the ebook, the Kindle,
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:27.000]   are approved independently.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.520]   So just 'cause it's approved for one,
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:29.640]   it's not approved for the other.
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:32.000]   After I published "Anarchist Handbook"
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.240]   and it was a big success,
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:36.600]   they unleashed, enrolled, excuse me,
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.480]   a hardcover edition program.
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.840]   So I'm like, oh, great, I'll put in hardcover.
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:44.160]   They're like, sorry, this is too similar
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:46.960]   to Murray Rothbard's "Anatomy of State,"
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.720]   which is a pamphlet or short book
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:49.600]   that Murray Rothbard wrote.
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:51.960]   I go, well, wait, I have the entirety
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:54.160]   of "Anatomy of State" in here.
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:56.600]   I have permission from the Mises Institute in writing,
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.840]   which I'm giving to you, to reprint it.
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:01.880]   And you guys already have it been published for a year
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:03.640]   as a paperback and ebook.
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:06.000]   And they're like, too bad, blocked.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.840]   So it's not available as a hardcover on Amazon,
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.080]   even though it's available,
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:13.600]   maybe now it's gonna be pulled as paperback and ebook.
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:16.080]   So with this book, I was anticipating,
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:18.760]   all right, there's gonna be some whatever.
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:21.320]   The thing with how it works is you have to upload it
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:24.640]   and hit publish, and then you gotta wait for the approval.
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:26.120]   I'm like, okay, this is gonna be who knows.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.320]   I just wanted to get as fast as possible.
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:32.280]   4 a.m., in less than 24 hours, I get a notification,
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.440]   congratulations, your book's available for sale.
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:38.040]   And I have to run downstairs and pull it from publication,
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:40.960]   'cause otherwise it was out and I didn't finish editing it.
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:44.320]   So that's the situation there.
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:45.840]   - Oh, that's fascinating.
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.080]   But that's powerful.
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:49.160]   That's like, it's all in your hands.
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.000]   It's all on you.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.600]   - Yes, and I think the program is great.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.520]   It charts just like any other book.
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.200]   The quality of the books is great.
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:03.200]   I am very happy with, I have no contact with them.
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:07.080]   My buddy Tucker Max, he had a company that did this
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.240]   and they basically help people sell, publish their own book.
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.160]   They did Dave Goggins' book.
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:11.760]   I think you've talked to him, haven't you?
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:13.480]   - Yeah, maybe they emailed me or something.
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:14.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:17.960]   And he said, I have done dozens,
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.520]   maybe hundreds of books with them.
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:21.440]   I have never been able to get someone on the phone.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:23.360]   So I don't know what's going on over there,
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:27.520]   but guys, if you wanna reach out to me, please call me.
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:29.400]   It's Michael@lexfriedman.com.
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:31.640]   (laughing)
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:34.400]   - Friedman is spelled wrong.
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:37.200]   - Yeah, if you ever have any complaints,
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:42.720]   please just @ me at Twitter about Michael.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:47.720]   Now, why do you think so few established authors
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:51.120]   self-publish?
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:54.480]   I mean, it seems like it makes perfect sense
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:56.760]   in this modern society to be able to,
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:58.360]   when you finish the book,
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:00.880]   to publish it within a few days, a few weeks.
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:04.360]   I think I talked to Jordan Peterson about this at length
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:06.800]   and Michaela, his daughter, who I'm also good friends with.
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:08.400]   She's actually named after Gorbachev,
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:09.680]   who's the big hero of this book.
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:10.960]   - Also a friend?
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:15.960]   - Michaela, you know, I was in talks to interview Gorbachev
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:17.280]   and then COVID hit.
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:18.840]   And that's one of the big regrets of my life
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:19.680]   that I didn't get.
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:23.360]   I think if I met him, I would be on my knees,
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:25.520]   literally kissing his feet, crying.
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:29.760]   I mean, one of the big points of "The White Pill"
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:32.360]   is there were so many moments
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:34.320]   when they were calling him up,
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:37.800]   sending the tanks, we want another Tiananmen Square.
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:39.760]   And he's like, fuck you.
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:43.640]   So when you have anyone who has the capacity
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:46.640]   to murder thousands of people
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:49.480]   and chooses to withhold that power,
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:50.760]   like all I could do is applaud.
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:52.400]   - He resisted the cynicism.
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:53.240]   - Yes.
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:54.760]   Wait, so why the authors,
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:55.920]   why don't publish some of the books?
[01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:59.200]   I think they're still in the,
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:00.640]   you know how like there was this whole idea
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:02.920]   about how if you're a movie actor, you don't go on TV
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:04.800]   'cause that like kind of ruins your brand.
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:06.400]   So, and that's kind of going away.
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:07.880]   There's a lot of shows where the lead
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:09.360]   is now like a former movie actor.
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:11.200]   And this is kind of like a big thing,
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:12.360]   like Matthew McConaughey,
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:15.080]   he had a TV show on HBO, I believe.
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:17.520]   So I think there's this kind of like, wait a minute.
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:18.680]   What's that?
[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:19.520]   I didn't hear what you said.
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.360]   - I said, all right.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:23.840]   Is it all right?
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:26.320]   All right, all right, all right.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.920]   Matthew McConaughey, all right, all right.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:31.040]   I don't know what that is, sorry.
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:33.880]   - Just I'll explain it.
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:35.320]   What, look at the context below.
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:37.800]   - Okay, so I think for them,
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:41.760]   it might be A, a loss of credibility to some extent,
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:46.160]   but B, their agent whose job is to sell them
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:49.000]   and get a big advance wouldn't be encouraged
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.160]   to self-publish 'cause their age,
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:51.760]   you know, so I don't think it's percolated
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:55.280]   to powerful people yet how feasible this is
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:57.960]   and how profitable it is
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.920]   and how they'll still be able to reach their audience.
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:05.000]   And I feel if, you know, I don't,
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.840]   if "Anarchist Handbook" wasn't such a gigantic success,
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:11.920]   I would be much more nervous about "The White Pill,"
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:12.880]   but the fact that it was
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:14.320]   and that I saw it from start to finish
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.480]   and I know the ins and outs,
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:17.520]   now I'm like, what are you guys bringing to the table?
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:19.120]   So that's taking a year of my time
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:21.720]   and introducing edits that I would not otherwise agree with.
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:22.920]   - I think for some people,
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:27.320]   a book is a sort of beacon of reputation.
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:28.800]   - Yes. - So it's really important
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:32.080]   to not, there's somehow not as much reputation
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:34.000]   associated with a self-published book
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.440]   unless it's successful.
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:36.520]   - Yes.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:40.440]   - And then like the, it's success outshines
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:42.600]   the actual however it was published.
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:46.080]   I think, I guess David Goggins self-published his book.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.240]   - 'Cause it used to be you self-published
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:49.560]   when you can't get a book deal,
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:51.400]   so it's like an admission of failure.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:55.560]   - Yeah, so you would recommend it as something for authors?
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:58.160]   - No, I would recommend it as something for authors
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:01.200]   of a certain stature, for lack of better term.
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:04.240]   Because it is still, in terms of your resume
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:08.720]   and your experience, it's better to get a crappy advance
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:12.680]   and have a book with St. Martins that goes nowhere
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:16.040]   than a self-published book that goes nowhere.
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:18.420]   So the other thing is you have to make sure
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:19.460]   you have enough of an audience
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:21.400]   that you can move some copies.
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.840]   - What about OnlyFans?
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:24.380]   Would you recommend authors?
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:27.080]   How much money do you think you and I could make
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:30.240]   if we did bathtub scenes in OnlyFans?
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:31.400]   No, just chilling, just reading,
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:34.280]   like reading Animal Farm, just like while sitting--
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:35.120]   - Beastiality.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:37.520]   (laughs)
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:38.360]   - I don't know.
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:39.200]   - Okay, Snowflake.
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:42.340]   Snowball, sorry, Snowball, okay, Snowball.
[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:45.520]   - All right.
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:46.480]   - What was his name?
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:47.320]   - Snowball.
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:48.640]   - No, the horse.
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:49.480]   - Boxer.
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:50.520]   - I'm hung like a boxer.
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:54.640]   - I will work harder.
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:58.040]   - That guy, I think about that guy a lot.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:02:58.880]   - Boxer?
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:01.360]   - Yeah, his motto was I will work harder.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.000]   Anything that happens, like the pigs would take advantage
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.080]   and his response to everything,
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:11.000]   he was inspiring to me because he never gave in
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:11.840]   to the cynicism.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.440]   - Right, and they killed him.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:14.260]   - Yeah.
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:15.100]   - Spoiler, sorry.
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:19.360]   - But that's a good way to die, never giving in.
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:21.000]   - Well, yeah, there's a lot of that in this book
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.280]   about the people who are like,
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:24.160]   I'm not, you're not gonna break me.
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:26.520]   Like, I am bigger than this.
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.080]   - Did you ever believe in Santa?
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:34.440]   - I remember the day I woke up on New Year's
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.240]   and there was a present under my pillow
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:38.100]   and it was like, holy shit.
[02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:42.360]   'Cause Dead Maroz left it.
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:43.640]   That's the whole thing, he leaves your present
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:44.480]   under your pillow.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:46.020]   - Right, so you believed, but what,
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:48.240]   I thought the story was gonna be when you first realized
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:49.960]   he's not real.
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:51.560]   - I don't remember when I realized he wasn't real,
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:53.720]   but that story was, I did think it was real.
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:55.000]   I was like, oh my God.
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.960]   - And okay, there's this, 'cause I did too.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:02.320]   And I remember, I don't think I can put myself
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:04.000]   in the mindset of the kind of person
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.680]   that believed he was real.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:07.600]   'Cause what did I think?
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:09.400]   What was my worldview that allowed
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:14.440]   like a giant person in a red suit to be real?
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:17.000]   Although I do remember, I think the first time
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.720]   that Santa Claus showed up to our,
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:20.960]   like lived in this very small apartment.
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:23.700]   And when he first showed up to our apartment,
[02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:28.760]   I just remember, 'cause he was really drunk and smelled.
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:30.680]   It was like a party, it was like a New Year's party
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:31.520]   or whatever.
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:34.720]   So one of the people dressed up as Santa Claus,
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:39.720]   I just remember this, wow, this gotten like real fast.
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:44.120]   Of course, I remember like thinking, of course,
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:46.880]   of course it would be, like, what was I thinking?
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:48.280]   What was I thinking?
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:51.120]   There's gonna be some perfect, like--
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:51.960]   - Being.
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:54.400]   - Perfect being, like better than,
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:55.760]   like the best of humanity.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:59.200]   He was just a regular dude, kind of fat,
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:00.720]   but like not sexy fat.
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:05.320]   It was like, not really that jolly and kind of exhausted.
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:08.760]   And I really have not showered in a while, but also funny.
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:11.980]   - I remember, I love telling this story,
[02:05:11.980 --> 02:05:15.480]   how old I was and I must've been five or six.
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:17.620]   And it was just that age where you distinguish
[02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:19.360]   between what's real and what's not.
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:24.360]   So like Vikings and knights and ninjas are real
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:30.120]   and dragons and mermaids and elves are fake.
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:32.400]   And I was on the corner of Shore Parkway
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:35.340]   right before the park in Bensonhurst in Brooklyn.
[02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:38.160]   And around the corner wearing a denim vest
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:41.920]   was a little person, a dwarf.
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:44.240]   And I saw him and I was like, all right,
[02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:45.240]   back to the drawing board.
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:47.320]   Like, I don't know what's real or not anymore,
[02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:49.980]   'cause I just saw a dwarf, so I don't know what's going on.
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:53.400]   - And since then, given your relationship with Alex Jones,
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:54.520]   you've continued the journey
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.040]   of not knowing what's real or not.
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:57.520]   - That's correct.
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:59.140]   - All right, let's talk about the next steps.
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:01.960]   After Stalin took power, he started to actually,
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:05.040]   implementing some of the economic, some of the policies
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:07.400]   in this idea of collectivization.
[02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:08.400]   - Yeah.
[02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:12.120]   - What's the story of that in the '20s,
[02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:13.560]   leading into the '30s?
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:14.800]   What was this idea?
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:16.820]   What was the relationship between the regime,
[02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:18.800]   the ideology, and the farmers?
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:20.160]   - Well, there's always been,
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:22.100]   and obviously very much to this day,
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:27.040]   an enormous amount of enmity, for lack of a better term,
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:29.360]   hatred between Ukraine and Russia.
[02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:34.360]   I mean, this is centuries in the making, if not more.
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:38.720]   And the Ukraine, or Ukraine now, but at the time,
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:40.400]   I'm speaking of the region,
[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:42.800]   is and still is the breadbasket of Europe.
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:44.120]   It was very fertile lands.
[02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:46.320]   This is where the food comes from.
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:49.800]   And this was a issue also for Lenin,
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:50.920]   as I discuss in the book,
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:52.880]   'cause when you had famines there,
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:55.400]   you have famines throughout
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:57.600]   what later became the Soviet Union.
[02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:00.540]   And the problem is, this happened in North Korea as well,
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:02.960]   in the '90s, when they don't have food,
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:05.760]   if you let in foreigners and feed your people,
[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:07.180]   all of a sudden, you as the government
[02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:11.600]   are either superfluous or downright deleterious
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:14.600]   to their well-being, and that's a threat to your power.
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:18.360]   So Lenin let in an American organization in the early '20s,
[02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:21.240]   which was actually headed by Herbert Hoover, of all people.
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:23.000]   And after a while, Hoover left,
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.840]   because he found that the Bolsheviks
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:25.840]   were just taking the grain
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:27.400]   that the Americans were giving to feed the people
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:30.040]   and selling it for export while the people suffered.
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:35.040]   And one of the people who grew up in these starvation times
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:36.680]   was a young Mikhail Gorbachev,
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:38.600]   where he had, I think it was like a quarter
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:40.600]   or a third of his village starve to death
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:42.560]   during one of these periodic famines.
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:47.800]   Stalin's idea, this was a good mechanism for him
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:52.800]   to break the idea of Ukraine being an independent nation
[02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:54.760]   within its own identity.
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:59.440]   And he had this kind of liquidation of the kulaks,
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:02.600]   very famously, which thankfully is much more discussed now
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:05.120]   than it was maybe when you and I were kids.
[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:10.120]   And a kulak, the real meaning, or the literal meaning,
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:13.160]   is kind of this wealthy landowner, right?
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:16.880]   But very quickly, it's kind of like, it becomes outgroup.
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:21.080]   So, there was a big incentive
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:23.120]   to call someone you didn't like a kulak,
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:24.080]   and then good luck to you,
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:26.080]   'cause now the eyes of the state are on you,
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:28.720]   and you have to prove that you didn't hire people,
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:30.460]   you didn't have four cows,
[02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:32.180]   or how many acres, or so and so forth.
[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:36.600]   They took a huge percentage of the population, the kulaks,
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:38.200]   and they just deported them.
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:40.120]   These are lands that they had for generations,
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:44.600]   and they just spread them throughout broader Russia.
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:47.120]   Many of them never made it, and many of them were killed.
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:48.600]   This was by design.
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:51.720]   - And the dark thing about the kulaks, like you said,
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:55.680]   when it becomes abused, when it becomes the outgroup,
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:00.680]   is the kulak is supposed to be wealthier
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:04.960]   than sort of the general farmer peasant.
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:07.920]   And so, basically, it gives you a mechanism of resentment.
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:10.600]   Anybody that's better off must be better off
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:12.520]   because they're a kulak, let's get rid of them.
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:16.360]   And it has, just from an economics perspective,
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.160]   even leaving ethics aside,
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:23.160]   it basically completely de-incentivizes productivity.
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:26.680]   It wants you to fail, because if you succeed,
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:28.480]   you're a kulak, and you're going to be tortured,
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:30.160]   you're gonna be deported,
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:31.720]   you're going to be derided, all that.
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:34.120]   - And also, you're poor 'cause he's rich.
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:36.320]   Like, that's a big part of it.
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:38.520]   So, while this was going on,
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:40.160]   and food was becoming a problem
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:44.000]   because you had poor weather conditions,
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.960]   there was a campaign about, oh, the reason you're hungry
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:50.160]   is 'cause the kulaks are hoarding all their grain.
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:53.520]   And if you're somewhere else in the Soviet Union,
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:55.080]   how are you supposed to know any better?
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:56.480]   'Cause you're being told every year
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:59.000]   the crops are bumper crop, bumper crop, bumper crop,
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.160]   and now there's no food, there's no bread.
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:04.160]   And so, see, we produced all this bread,
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:05.160]   it's not getting to you
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:07.320]   'cause the kulaks are hoarding the grain.
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:11.520]   So, they came in what became known as the Haldimor,
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:14.760]   and Ann Applebaum, who's a great historian,
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:17.520]   who, unfortunately, I disagree with a lot
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:18.480]   in contemporary politics,
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:22.440]   but who's done so much great work about the Soviet Union
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:24.160]   that I pretty much give her a blank check
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:26.720]   and whatever she wants to say nowadays,
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:29.360]   she wrote a great book about this called "Red Famine,"
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:34.360]   and these activists descended on these villages like locusts,
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:38.440]   and their job was to requisition as much food as possible,
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:41.200]   and they would come back at all hours of the night
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:43.280]   to make sure you weren't hiding food,
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.440]   and this is what was so pernicious about it,
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:48.560]   your own body would betray you.
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:51.520]   They could look at you and see that you're not losing weight,
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:54.720]   you've got those chubby cheeks, that means you have food,
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:56.760]   and that's the government's food.
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:58.120]   That is the food of the people.
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:00.080]   And if you are keeping food for yourself,
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:01.720]   you are stealing from the people.
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:03.040]   You're an enemy of the people,
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:05.040]   and you deserve whatever comes to you.
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:07.040]   And it got to a point where they're eating,
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:10.820]   they didn't have grain to plant for the next harvest.
[02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:15.300]   And what was even sicker is, you know,
[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:19.520]   one of the big criticisms of communists, of the czar,
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:21.280]   was his internal passport system,
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:24.440]   that I can't go wherever I want within Russia,
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:26.800]   the Russian Empire, without permission.
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:28.720]   Stalin reintroduced this.
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:32.360]   So if your village was targeted, you can't leave.
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:33.880]   Now, some people got away,
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:36.320]   they tried to get to the cities and so on and so forth,
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:39.040]   but you get to the city and you're starving,
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:42.040]   you have no clothes, you're a kulak.
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:43.040]   I'm hungry 'cause of you,
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.720]   and now you're too lazy to work, get the F out of there.
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:48.240]   And there were stories, you know,
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:50.260]   I have them in the White Pill,
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:51.880]   of this like starving teenage girl,
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:53.920]   and she's begging for food,
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:56.720]   and the guy knocks, the shopkeep knocks the food out
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:11:58.680]   of her hand and she dies on the spot.
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:02.320]   And everyone in that line knew not to give her any food
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:04.960]   or any sympathy, because she's a kulak sympathizer.
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:07.340]   And very quickly, if you're a kulak sympathizer,
[02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:09.520]   all that has to happen is someone has to call,
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:11.160]   I think it was the NKVD at the time,
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:13.160]   you know, the different names, the Cheka,
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:14.680]   the secret police, and they have to be like,
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:18.200]   "Oh, you see, whatever her name was, Zhenya,
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:19.580]   "she was a kulak sympathizer.
[02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:21.980]   "We saw a kulak who was trying to shake us down for food
[02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:25.000]   "'cause too lazy to work, and she felt so bad for them.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.760]   "So you might wanna check in on Zhenya."
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:27.960]   So yeah.
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:31.880]   - But in '32 and '33, Holodomor,
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:36.880]   it wasn't just small injustice here and there.
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:41.880]   It was mass starvation and suffering.
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:45.440]   - Yes, millions starved to death in the Ukraine alone,
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:46.500]   and by design.
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:52.360]   - So you mentioned Ann Applebaum's book, "Red Famine,"
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:53.740]   "Stalin's War in Ukraine,"
[02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:55.920]   but another excellent book on the topic.
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:57.760]   And by the way, thank you for recommending that to me.
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:12:59.080]   So it was--
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:00.280]   - Her work's amazing.
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:04.000]   - Yeah, it's a really, really powerful book
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.120]   about not just about Holodomor,
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:08.760]   but the context of Ukraine,
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:12.600]   basically the history of Ukraine that's relevant for today.
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:13.680]   - Yeah.
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:16.380]   - To understand, understand the relationship
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:17.920]   between Russia and Ukraine.
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:21.520]   But another great book is "Bloodlands, Europe
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:23.320]   "Between Hitler and Stalin" by Timothy Snyder.
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:25.240]   I don't know, I think you also recommended that to me
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:26.440]   at some point, or maybe not.
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:29.160]   - I haven't, but I'm familiar with that and read it.
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:33.400]   - So he does quite a bit of, it's brief,
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.160]   but extremely well-researched writing
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.920]   about cannibalism there.
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:37.760]   - Oh, God.
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:40.160]   - And that it was not uncommon during the Stalin-imposed
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:42.120]   famine in the Soviet Ukraine for parents
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:43.800]   to cook and eat their children.
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:46.280]   He writes, quote, "Survival was a moral
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:47.720]   "as well as a physical struggle.
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:50.820]   "A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933
[02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:53.380]   "that she had not yet become a cannibal,
[02:13:53.380 --> 02:13:56.440]   "but was not sure that I shall not be one
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:59.000]   "by the time my letter reaches you."
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.160]   End quotes.
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:01.640]   The good people died first.
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:04.980]   Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died.
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:07.400]   Those who gave food to others died.
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:09.800]   Those who refused to eat corpses died.
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:12.620]   Those who refused to kill their fellow man died.
[02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:14.680]   Parents who resisted cannibalism died
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:16.200]   before their children did.
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:20.720]   And there's stories in there about, yeah, cooking,
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:21.840]   cooking your children.
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:29.320]   The other thing about cannibalism, about famine in general
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:32.920]   that stood out to me, unlike a lot of atrocities,
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:36.520]   is the people that are starving are exhausted.
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:38.700]   They're basically unable to think.
[02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:43.240]   So they don't even have the energy to protest.
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.080]   It's a strange kind of way to kill thinking in the populace.
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:53.240]   I suppose it was obvious,
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:56.280]   but there's something fundamental about starvation
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:59.880]   where it slowly removes your humanity.
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:05.440]   - Yeah, there was a scene in the book
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:09.800]   where a lot of times people literally go crazy.
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:11.200]   And there's a scene where a mom,
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:13.680]   it's some nursing, a train station was nursing her kid
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:16.840]   and she was going mad from hunger
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:18.760]   and she starts beating the crap out of her baby
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:20.400]   and kicking it and then she just reverts to normal
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:21.700]   like nothing had happened.
[02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:26.120]   - Yeah, madness, you lose your mind.
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:28.560]   - Yeah, and I mean, I don't know
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:30.600]   what the physiological cause of this,
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:33.040]   I think it's, if someone has dealt
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:35.080]   with a glycogen depletion, it affects their mood,
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:37.080]   things like that, so taken to an extreme,
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:39.380]   who knows what happens when parts of the brain
[02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:41.280]   start functioning and start imploding.
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:46.240]   But yeah, what just happened,
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:47.520]   this is something that's really cool
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:49.040]   regarding the Holodomor.
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:53.280]   So there was one Western journalist,
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:56.360]   Gareth Jones, who was like,
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.080]   all right, something's not adding up here.
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:03.240]   So he was supposed to take a train through Ukraine
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:07.840]   and he got out early and decided to start walking
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:11.280]   through the countryside to go from village to village.
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:14.120]   And I'll get to his story in a minute,
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:16.960]   right before we started recording,
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:18.040]   I got this book in the mail,
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:21.600]   I ordered it on November 28th from Great Britain.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:25.080]   It was the only copy available on the whole internet.
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:27.520]   It's called "Experiences in Russia, 1931."
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:30.600]   It is anonymous and it's,
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:32.640]   Gareth Jones wrote the introduction.
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:34.660]   It was published by the Alton Press in Pittsburgh,
[02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:39.040]   it was self-published and see, it just says forward,
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:41.140]   it just says by the author.
[02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:47.080]   So it was the author who went alongside Gareth Jones,
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:51.680]   Gareth Jones was someone by the name of Henry John Hines,
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:58.200]   who was heir to the Hines fortune.
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:01.400]   And you only know that if you start looking at the internet
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:02.960]   'cause his name's not anywhere in this book.
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:05.520]   Well, I opened this book up right when I got it,
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:09.920]   right before we're taping and it's signed by him.
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:11.440]   And it took me a second, I'm like, wait a minute,
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:12.400]   who is this signed by?
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:14.680]   And it's H.J. Hines 'cause his name was Jack Hines,
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:16.640]   but it was Henry John Hines.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:18.840]   So this is, I'm very excited
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:21.440]   that I had this little miracle in the mail.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:23.720]   - Christmas miracle. - It's a Christmas miracle.
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:26.080]   - They traveled together? - They traveled together.
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:28.160]   So this book's a diary of their travels.
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:30.680]   - Why do you think so few journalists
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:32.480]   was able to do what he did?
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:34.040]   - So there were several reasons.
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:36.200]   First of all, if you were a Western journalist
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:41.200]   in the Soviet Union, you were under very strict circumstances.
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:44.920]   First of all, you could be deported at any time.
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:47.520]   You had no, there was no pretense
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:50.880]   that you have a right to be a journalist in,
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:52.800]   as especially as a representative of a capitalist
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:55.000]   by which they meant Western paper.
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.520]   Second, it was a complete nightmare
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:00.040]   getting your articles filed
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:01.760]   because you had a censor that you had to go through
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:04.200]   and the censor's job, whose life depended on it,
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:07.060]   was to make sure that your story was advantageous
[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:09.120]   to the Soviet Union or at least neutral.
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:10.880]   And they had all sorts of techniques.
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.700]   You know, they could spy, they spied on you all the time.
[02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:15.080]   They followed you around 'cause you're a foreigner,
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:18.480]   but also that censor had to answer to somebody.
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:20.280]   So all the censor has to do is be like,
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:23.600]   "Look, I'm having trouble with my supervisor."
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:24.720]   And the reporter could be like,
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:25.960]   "Well, can I talk to the supervisor?"
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:27.520]   It's like, "Well, I'm sorry, that's not possible."
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:29.540]   And he's on deadline, but it's too bad.
[02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:32.640]   Bureaucracy doesn't recognize the needs of deadlines.
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:37.640]   So there was a big pressure, a lot of pressure
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:41.380]   on Western journalists to have to get through this net.
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:42.720]   And that's literally constant.
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:44.960]   You know, every story, it's gonna be a fight.
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:46.520]   So at a certain point, you're just gonna be like,
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:48.780]   "All right," and you're gonna pre-censor yourself.
[02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:51.680]   You know, if you know, "All right, if I include this,
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:54.520]   it's not gonna get through, what are you supposed to do?"
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:56.840]   I think human beings are naturally,
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:00.320]   and also a lot of these journalists were pro-Soviet.
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:03.780]   They thought this is the society of the future.
[02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:07.880]   At least everyone's trying to make it a better country
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:09.800]   for everyone, not like back home
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:12.240]   with a poor slip between the cracks.
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:15.520]   We gotta do what we can to make this work.
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:20.520]   And, you know, there was a lot of,
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:24.200]   I don't wanna say conspiracy, but within the industry,
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:28.680]   there was a consensus that the Stalin was the good guy,
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:30.280]   and we were, if not the bad guys,
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:33.020]   certainly not as good in certain regards.
[02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:37.360]   So when this news of the famine started percolating,
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:40.240]   all the other Western journalists besides Gareth Jones
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:43.520]   and Malcolm Muggeridge were saying this isn't true.
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:45.920]   It's nothing that they haven't seen before.
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:48.440]   The paper that took the lead in this was "The New York Times"
[02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:50.240]   with their guy Walter Duranty,
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:51.960]   who had previously won a Pulitzer,
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:53.120]   and had interviewed Stalin,
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:56.040]   which was an enormously rare honor for a Westerner.
[02:19:56.040 --> 02:20:00.120]   And he, because he has so much experience
[02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:02.720]   covering Russia and the Soviet Union,
[02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:04.040]   he basically took the lead,
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:05.560]   and other people followed his lead.
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:07.520]   You know, he was kind of the dean
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:10.160]   of the press corps in Russia.
[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:11.920]   And he made a point, and the thing,
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:14.680]   there's so many quotes I have from him,
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:17.360]   where he's not only denying
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:19.040]   that this mass starvation is happening,
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:20.840]   he's also going after journalists
[02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:22.680]   who are questioning the narrative.
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:24.440]   And he, you know, he says things like,
[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:26.520]   "Look, this is nothing
[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:28.400]   "that the Russians haven't experienced before.
[02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:30.000]   "They're simply tightening their belts."
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.040]   And it's like, you only have to tighten your belt
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:34.200]   when you don't have enough food.
[02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:36.520]   It's not like they started a new exercise regimen,
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:38.560]   and now their body fat's dropping.
[02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:40.720]   That's, why would someone tighten their belt?
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:42.040]   So that was one.
[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:47.040]   And the New York Times had a 13-page article,
[02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:50.440]   big headline, "Russians Hungry, Not Starving."
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:51.920]   And he went after Jones,
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:54.760]   he went after Magritch, I believe.
[02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:55.960]   Although he did go after Magritch,
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:20:59.200]   but the point being that this is just propaganda
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:01.760]   from people who want the Soviet Union to fail.
[02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:02.720]   You know, they don't understand
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:04.720]   what they're building here.
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:06.400]   You know, he had so many excuses, like,
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:09.720]   "Oh, you know, the reason all these Russians
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:12.560]   "are supposedly leaving their villages to go to the cities
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:14.240]   "isn't 'cause there's no food,
[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:16.560]   "it's because they're nomadic, it's tradition.
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:19.280]   "They go from town to town looking for new experiences."
[02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:21.720]   And it's just, you know, at a certain point,
[02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:24.960]   and I think it was 1941, where he was eventually like,
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:26.920]   or '51 rather, I don't remember,
[02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:31.160]   he was like, "Oh, well, I guess I was kind of wrong."
[02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:33.440]   And it's like, he's like, "Any journalist worth his salt
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:34.720]   "can admit when he's wrong."
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:36.640]   And it's like, "Well, were you worth your salt?
[02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:40.000]   "Because you sure, you, he explicitly said
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:43.680]   "there's no point in sending out journalists
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:44.560]   "to look for themselves.
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:46.760]   "I've been through the countryside and everyone's fine.
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.360]   "And it's just that the loudest people are making noise,
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:51.840]   "whereas everyone else is doing the work and, you know,
[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:54.800]   "trying, and this isn't about famine,
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:57.760]   "but it's about Westerners skeptical about collectivization,
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:21:59.560]   "which is just simply a new way of farming."
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:00.960]   And yeah, it was a new way of farming.
[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:03.160]   And the results were by design,
[02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:06.240]   and also accidentally absolutely catastrophic.
[02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:11.960]   - How hard was it to see the truth at that time,
[02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:13.000]   do you think?
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.520]   Do you think that was a mistake
[02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:17.440]   that's understandable to make as a journalist?
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:19.980]   - If my job as a journalist,
[02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:23.560]   I have two bosses if I'm in Moscow.
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:27.280]   I've got my reporter in New York or London or whatever,
[02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:30.040]   but I've got my censor here.
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:34.720]   And he is making sure I have a house, that apartment.
[02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:36.080]   He makes sure I have food.
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:38.600]   He makes sure I have access to dignitaries.
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:40.120]   He's my lifeline.
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:44.160]   If I piss him off, I'm on the next plane out of town.
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:45.680]   So that-- - Is that enough?
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:47.000]   Is that enough to
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:53.560]   slowly suffocate the integrity of a journalist?
[02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:54.880]   - I don't think it was slow at all.
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:56.480]   And it was clearly enough.
[02:22:56.480 --> 02:22:57.320]   And because what are they gonna do?
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:22:58.320]   - I disagree with that.
[02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:01.120]   I think the failure of integrity
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:03.280]   has to come from the New York,
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:05.440]   on the American side.
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:07.840]   That it's just the flock of fish or whatever
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:10.880]   that all move in the same narrative.
[02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:12.060]   - Right.
[02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:13.160]   - I think journalists
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:18.260]   would like to be the kind of people that have integrity.
[02:23:18.260 --> 02:23:21.280]   So if they are conscious of sacrificing their own integrity,
[02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:22.120]   they wouldn't do it.
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:24.680]   If they're conscious of an act that's doing it,
[02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:25.760]   they wouldn't do it.
[02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:28.920]   So it has to happen like a lobster slowly boiling.
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:31.920]   - No, I think it happens when everyone else is,
[02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:33.360]   it's a Greek chorus, right?
[02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:34.600]   - Right, right, it's a chorus.
[02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:36.320]   But that's exactly, that's right.
[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:37.880]   So it's not about the act.
[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:39.400]   But they will, I mean,
[02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:43.440]   I've talked to journalists where I get the sense
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:46.040]   that they will sell their soul for access.
[02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:49.200]   - 'Cause that's their job.
[02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:50.360]   - Is it though?
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:53.200]   'Cause what they do, what journalists do,
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:54.960]   I've seen American journalists.
[02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:58.840]   They take a huge amount of pride for having gotten
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:02.040]   the interview, whatever that is, the Putin interview.
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:07.960]   And first of all, they're glowing with pride.
[02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:10.260]   It seems like they're always showing off
[02:24:10.260 --> 02:24:12.400]   to the other journalists back in America.
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:14.320]   So they're glowing, showing off like,
[02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:16.520]   look, I got the access, you didn't.
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:17.780]   And second thing they're doing
[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:19.360]   when they show up to that interview
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:21.800]   is they ask all the questions that signal
[02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:26.400]   to the other journalists that we're on the same side.
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:30.140]   They ask the most generic, aggressive questions
[02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:31.880]   to which they know the answers.
[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:36.840]   They just, they want to basically get the access
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:40.240]   and ask the quote unquote hard-hitting questions
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:42.320]   that they know will not be answered.
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:44.480]   And this is the entire machinery of it.
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:47.080]   That's not, that's modern journalism.
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:49.300]   And I suppose at that time--
[02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:50.200]   - It was worse.
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:51.440]   - It was worse.
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:53.200]   They weren't even doing the hard-hitting,
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:55.520]   the display of hard-hitting questions.
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:56.360]   - Right.
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:57.520]   - It was PR pieces.
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:00.640]   - Think about what high status that is
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:02.840]   if I'm an American journalist in Moscow.
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:05.920]   I'm allowed in this secretive country.
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:12.320]   I'm the guy who's very privileged to have access
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:14.780]   to live in Moscow and tell Americans,
[02:25:14.780 --> 02:25:16.720]   which are all fascinated about this new society,
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:18.740]   the future, what it's like.
[02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:23.300]   And as soon as I kind of start questioning the narrative,
[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:27.060]   I'm gonna get kicked out and humiliated very publicly.
[02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:28.020]   I thought you were in Moscow.
[02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:29.420]   What am I supposed to say?
[02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:34.060]   So, they, Eugene Lyons was,
[02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:35.380]   he's one of the heroes in the book.
[02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:38.140]   He was a young communist and I think it was United Press
[02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:40.160]   he was working for, they sent him there.
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:41.780]   And when he went there, he's like,
[02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:44.320]   oh, this is not what I thought it was gonna be like.
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:45.380]   This is horrible.
[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:48.060]   And he turned very heavily against it.
[02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:52.420]   But he talks about how they would write one thing
[02:25:52.420 --> 02:25:55.180]   and say another thing and then think another thing.
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:57.220]   And each of those steps was just more and more
[02:25:57.220 --> 02:26:00.340]   like kind of lying in terms of maintaining your sanity
[02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:02.440]   and maintaining your narrative.
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:07.020]   - So, you reference Ann Applebaum and say that,
[02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:09.580]   quote, "Starvation was not simply a consequence.
[02:26:09.580 --> 02:26:11.340]   "It was the goal and it was the law.
[02:26:11.340 --> 02:26:15.180]   "Stalin intended to break the Ukrainians once and for all.
[02:26:15.180 --> 02:26:17.540]   "It thus became common for villagers to spy
[02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:18.980]   "and inform on one another.
[02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:21.900]   "Turning in a neighbor for having a sack of grain
[02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:23.760]   "might be the easiest and safest way
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:26.260]   "to procure food for one's family."
[02:26:26.260 --> 02:26:27.100]   - Yeah.
[02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:31.700]   - To what degree was this the intention?
[02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:36.540]   To what degree did Stalin anticipate this kind of suffering
[02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:39.580]   as a consequence of the collectivization policy?
[02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:41.740]   - I don't know that he intended the suffering
[02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:44.180]   to be a consequence of the collectivization.
[02:26:44.180 --> 02:26:48.500]   But it was quite apparent,
[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:51.780]   and I think there's a pretty heavy consensus nowadays,
[02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:56.020]   that his goal was very much, 'cause Ukraine, again,
[02:26:56.020 --> 02:26:59.380]   resented the czar and had this kind of
[02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:02.400]   very contentious relationship with Russia,
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:04.660]   which obviously very clearly remains today.
[02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:06.020]   I mean, the hatred of Ukrainians
[02:27:06.020 --> 02:27:08.540]   for Russians preceded Putin's war.
[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:12.220]   I mean, this is, even when I was a kid,
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:13.680]   I obviously don't remember it,
[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:15.900]   but my parents just told me the hatred that they had.
[02:27:15.900 --> 02:27:16.780]   And understandably, I mean,
[02:27:16.780 --> 02:27:18.540]   they were basically under foreign occupation,
[02:27:18.540 --> 02:27:20.460]   what they regard as foreign occupation for--
[02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:22.560]   - So your parents talked about a hatred
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:23.940]   by Ukrainians towards Russians?
[02:27:23.940 --> 02:27:24.860]   - Oh, yes.
[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:25.700]   Oh, yes.
[02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:26.860]   - I mean, I, you know,
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:31.460]   I certainly, having visited there this year,
[02:27:31.460 --> 02:27:36.300]   because of the most recent invasion in February,
[02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:41.160]   that hatred is nationwide and very intense.
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:43.300]   But I don't know, I think the feeling,
[02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:45.720]   the emotions were much more complex before.
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:46.560]   - But at the same time,
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:48.460]   at least they were under occupation before, right?
[02:27:48.460 --> 02:27:49.660]   And they couldn't speak Ukrainian,
[02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:51.160]   they had to speak Russian.
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:52.480]   So this was a thing.
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:56.980]   - But because of the forced intermixing,
[02:27:56.980 --> 02:28:00.420]   it's a more complex story.
[02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:01.500]   - Okay.
[02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:03.500]   But I mean, they weren't certainly fans.
[02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:07.780]   - Yeah, but there's people that came from Russia
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:09.060]   that are living there, they're marrying,
[02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:11.820]   they're falling in love, they're working with each other.
[02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:15.180]   So there is the bigger atrocity of the genocide of it,
[02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:18.260]   but there's also the reality of intermixing of peoples.
[02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:19.100]   - Well, sure, I mean--
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:22.460]   - There's the atrocity of slavery in the United States,
[02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:24.060]   but then there's also a reality
[02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:27.300]   that there's now an intermixing of peoples,
[02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:28.300]   and now they fall in love,
[02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:30.980]   and they live after slavery's abolished.
[02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:32.220]   That's just the reality.
[02:28:32.220 --> 02:28:35.060]   After the genocide,
[02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:41.100]   proceeds a kind of generational integration
[02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:44.460]   that still remembers, like the suffering reverberates,
[02:28:44.460 --> 02:28:45.580]   but there's still,
[02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:48.780]   it's a different culture that's created.
[02:28:48.780 --> 02:28:50.560]   And now, I think,
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:55.940]   I mean, I have complex story,
[02:28:55.940 --> 02:28:57.640]   most of my family's from Ukraine,
[02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:03.740]   and my understanding is grounded in Soviet Ukraine.
[02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:08.100]   But there is something in the last 30 years
[02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:09.380]   that's different,
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:11.600]   where now, after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:15.960]   there's a true, maybe renewed fight for independence,
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:18.080]   and that's a different thing.
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:19.120]   - But there's also a difference,
[02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:22.020]   like if I go to North Korea as an American,
[02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:24.660]   they're very friendly now, right?
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:29.560]   They don't perceive me as part of the yank devils.
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:30.900]   They're like, "Okay, you're an American,
[02:29:30.900 --> 02:29:32.160]   "but you come from America."
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:34.100]   So yeah, there's gonna be intermarriage,
[02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:35.140]   but that's a big difference
[02:29:35.140 --> 02:29:39.780]   between the perception of Russia as an entity,
[02:29:39.780 --> 02:29:41.980]   as opposed to some individual Russians.
[02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:48.080]   - I just, that wasn't the experience I've had
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.600]   talking to a lot of friends and family in Ukraine
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:51.880]   until the war started.
[02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:53.320]   - Really, so they really didn't have
[02:29:53.320 --> 02:29:55.400]   this kind of low-key animosity toward Russians?
[02:29:55.400 --> 02:30:00.400]   - No, there was a lot of factional conflict inside Ukraine.
[02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:02.800]   - Okay.
[02:30:02.800 --> 02:30:04.960]   - Now, the whole country is united.
[02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:07.440]   I think there's a clarity now,
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:11.600]   the war gave a clarity that wasn't there before.
[02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:12.660]   - No, this is, I was saying earlier
[02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:14.600]   how humans define themselves by opposition.
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:16.280]   So now that there's a war, it's like,
[02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:18.520]   okay, all this little stuff doesn't matter.
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:20.400]   We are all united 'cause we have a common enemy.
[02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:23.520]   - But there's also, as you know, there's regions,
[02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:27.800]   and there's just groups of different people,
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:29.580]   and then one of the big divides, of course,
[02:30:29.580 --> 02:30:31.520]   is the city versus rural,
[02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:32.920]   and then in the case of Ukraine,
[02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:36.760]   it's Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.
[02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:38.840]   It's very difficult to know what the truth is,
[02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:41.160]   'cause my personal experience is sampled.
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:42.000]   - Right.
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.280]   - I don't know how many Ukrainians I know,
[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:47.440]   maybe like 30 or 40, before this trip, like 30 or 40,
[02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:49.960]   and then I'm close with just a handful.
[02:30:49.960 --> 02:30:52.220]   But then it's hard to know,
[02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:54.360]   'cause you get a lot of Western press perspective,
[02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:55.760]   and you get the Russian perspective,
[02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:56.880]   and you get other perspectives,
[02:30:56.880 --> 02:30:59.480]   and it's very hard to know how much hate there is
[02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:02.640]   outside of this conflict.
[02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:05.040]   So my primary question is,
[02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:06.440]   and this is what I ask a lot of people
[02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:08.240]   when I visit Ukraine is,
[02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:13.080]   will you ever be able to forgive the Russians?
[02:31:13.080 --> 02:31:17.660]   And a lot of people said, "Never, never."
[02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:19.160]   So this isn't just about,
[02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:22.280]   assuming we win, they would say,
[02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:24.980]   assuming we win, we still will not ever forgive.
[02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:27.480]   Never, never forgive.
[02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:30.500]   And they said it in a way where like,
[02:31:30.500 --> 02:31:33.800]   not only us, but our children will never forgive.
[02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:35.400]   And it wasn't just, you know what,
[02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:39.360]   it wasn't just about Russia or the Russian leadership,
[02:31:39.360 --> 02:31:41.020]   it was about the Russian people.
[02:31:41.020 --> 02:31:45.840]   But a lot of people also said that
[02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:48.640]   this is our feeling currently, we understand.
[02:31:48.640 --> 02:31:51.600]   Like you're lost in the rage of war.
[02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:52.680]   - Yeah.
[02:31:52.680 --> 02:31:53.520]   - Because you lose so much.
[02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:54.920]   - But I mean, if you asked Americans,
[02:31:54.920 --> 02:31:57.040]   would you ever be friends with Germany or Japan,
[02:31:57.040 --> 02:31:58.360]   they'd be like, "Are you kidding?
[02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:00.000]   "After Pearl Harbor?"
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:00.840]   - Yeah.
[02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:03.600]   But of course, most Americans didn't feel Pearl Harbor
[02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:04.720]   is different.
[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:08.680]   It's a good point when it's your own land,
[02:32:08.680 --> 02:32:12.840]   but when, imagine it wasn't just Pearl Harbor,
[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:17.840]   but it was New York and Chicago and Dallas
[02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:20.400]   and all these cities being bombed.
[02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:21.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:31.280]   - It's just a linger on this war in Ukraine currently.
[02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:36.240]   Does it break your heart to see what's going on there now,
[02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:40.880]   that it's on the same land as the same cities,
[02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:44.640]   the same stories are now brought back to the surface,
[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:47.880]   like the generational pain as it was
[02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:51.060]   in the time that you're writing about?
[02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:53.800]   Do you think it's a fundamentally different country,
[02:32:53.800 --> 02:32:55.280]   different war, different situation,
[02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:59.160]   or do you hear echoes of the same?
[02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:00.840]   - I don't think it's the same
[02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:04.960]   because I think there is no one,
[02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:09.280]   or I mean, there is no one who is like,
[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:12.680]   "I'm glad this is happening to the Ukrainian people," right?
[02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:17.200]   So even the people who are for Putin and for the invasion
[02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:21.040]   and whatever justification they might have for his war,
[02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:25.000]   no one is like, "Yeah, let's get those darn Ukrainians."
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:29.320]   I think there was that sense in America after 9/11
[02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:32.280]   when we invade Afghanistan and Iraq
[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:35.380]   and there was like, "F those Iraqis, F those Afghan people."
[02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:40.640]   Whereas now, I think it's completely the opposite.
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:44.280]   I also think a lot of Russians, I'm sure if I ask them,
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:45.800]   they're not thinking like,
[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:47.720]   "Let's wipe the Ukrainian people off the map."
[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:49.720]   I think whatever reasons they have,
[02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:51.840]   it's not kind of going after this.
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:53.600]   Even if you have to kind of rile up people
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:56.240]   against the citizenry, it's not to that level
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:01.240]   of the hatred of the kulaks, hatred of those villages.
[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:05.200]   - There's still a belief though amongst the soldiers
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:06.200]   outside of the big cities,
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:08.840]   their belief that the Ukrainian people
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:10.360]   who the Russian soldiers believe
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:11.900]   are their brothers and sisters
[02:34:11.900 --> 02:34:14.040]   are occupied by an evil regime.
[02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:15.440]   - Okay. - So you need to save them
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:16.320]   from the evil regime.
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:20.080]   - That's also very different from the Holodomor.
[02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:24.700]   And also there is dispute in the press
[02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:28.440]   about the causes, the consequences, the victims,
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:31.360]   the villains of Putin's war.
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:33.240]   But when it came to this,
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:37.240]   no one is denying that the war is happening.
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:41.000]   The New York Times isn't saying everything is fine
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.640]   and the only reason people are saying it's a problem
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:46.120]   is 'cause they hate Putin or they hate Zelensky.
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:47.520]   That's not a thing.
[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:50.320]   And the fact that we have so much footage
[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:52.840]   of what's happening in Ukraine.
[02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:55.880]   And you have, it takes two seconds to go on Google
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:58.400]   and you have a map of Russian advancement,
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:01.080]   what parts are they occupying,
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:03.000]   what parts are not under their control.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.200]   I did a little live stream,
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.160]   I raised money for Ukrainian refugees to feed them
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:10.620]   'cause that's my concern, just keeping people fed.
[02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:13.360]   There was none of that.
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:16.840]   And the two people who kind of spoke the truth,
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:18.440]   Gareth Jones was shot, I think,
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:21.080]   the day before his 30th birthday
[02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:25.920]   while he was uncovering news, I think it was in Mongolia.
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:28.560]   Malcolm Muggeridge had problem finding work
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:29.840]   when he exposed this.
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:33.560]   And I think, like we was talking about earlier,
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:37.720]   the ubiquity of things like cell phones and camera phones
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:39.920]   would make something like this,
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:42.160]   I don't know, I wouldn't say an impossibility,
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:43.560]   they could still do it,
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:47.600]   but it would be really hard to cover it up.
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:49.800]   - Well, sort of to push back on that,
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:53.560]   if you just look at Iran, I would draw a difference,
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:54.840]   I agree with you mostly,
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:56.760]   but I would also draw a different distinction
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:01.000]   when the atrocities happening to your own people
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.320]   versus there's a war.
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:04.720]   Ukraine is a sovereign independent nation,
[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:06.840]   there's not a war between two nations.
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:08.680]   It feels like it's easier for journalists
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:10.760]   to somehow reveal the truth in that.
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:13.800]   When the atrocities happen within the Soviet Union,
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:16.520]   for some reason, that's easier to hide.
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:18.640]   That's easier for journalists to deceive themselves
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:21.240]   and easier for the authoritarian leader to hide the--
[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:22.480]   - I think I agree with you.
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:25.880]   - And so that's the dark, I mean, that's why people,
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:29.000]   maybe you can educate me on this,
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:34.000]   but this is why I think people don't talk about
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:39.960]   Holodomor and other atrocities, the Great Leap Forward,
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:42.080]   because it's inside the country,
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:45.000]   versus the Holocaust, that's part of a war.
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.340]   Why is that that we,
[02:36:47.340 --> 02:36:54.120]   that we're too almost like afraid, too polite,
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:57.120]   too, what is it that we don't wanna cover the atrocities
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:36:58.200]   because it's inside the country?
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:01.040]   Like it's their business, so we don't want to touch it.
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:01.880]   Is that what, what is it, why?
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:06.240]   - I think it's that what we refer to as the news
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:09.000]   is in the business of selling narratives, right?
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.680]   And the narrative of the Holocaust is a very powerful one,
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:17.680]   which is if you let hatred of a subgroup in a population
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:23.240]   get out of control, this is the ultimate consequence,
[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:26.120]   and this is something that we all have to be scared of
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:28.120]   and do everything in our power to avoid in the future
[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:29.620]   for any outgroup.
[02:37:29.620 --> 02:37:33.520]   Whereas what's the narrative of the Holodomor?
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:35.480]   Sometimes governments kill their own citizens.
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:37.240]   There's nothing you could do about it.
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:38.840]   There's nothing we, I mean,
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:39.960]   they wouldn't have let us send food.
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:41.800]   They wouldn't acknowledge, like the newspapers,
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:43.440]   even Russia weren't acknowledging it.
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:46.760]   Like what's the, like this is some of the issues I had
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:48.760]   with regard to trying to advocate
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:50.280]   for the North Korean people.
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:51.120]   The reporters would be like,
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:52.720]   "Well, what can I do as an American?"
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:54.360]   It's a very natural question.
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:55.680]   And I'm like, "I don't know.
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:37:59.400]   "I like, all I know is how to speak to what is happening,
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:00.800]   "but in terms of next steps,
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:02.280]   "I don't have a good answer for you."
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:06.680]   So that is where the news kind of does break down
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:10.160]   if there isn't a story or a call to action,
[02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:12.960]   the kind of, you're kind of almost like having a movie
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:14.680]   with a cliffhanger and there's no sequel.
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:16.240]   It's like, what am I supposed to do here?
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:18.360]   Like, this is not scratching that itch,
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:21.160]   which for me, as a consumer of news, you know,
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:23.200]   a layman is like, okay, here's the story.
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:25.240]   There was a bad guy and the cops shot him
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:26.240]   or they took him to jail.
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:28.440]   And now the bad guy's caught, beginning, middle, end.
[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:30.800]   Here, it's just like, Mao did this.
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:33.280]   A lot of people were executed and starved.
[02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:34.440]   Isn't that awful?
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:36.200]   Well, and Mao's still in power.
[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:37.960]   Now Richard Nixon is raising a toast to him.
[02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:39.680]   Like, that story is just like,
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:42.120]   how am I supposed to feel about this?
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:44.600]   - Yeah, it feels like when there's tanks
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:46.880]   and there's war and there's military conflict,
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:48.640]   then it's more actionable.
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:49.600]   You can cover it.
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:50.440]   - Yeah.
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:52.520]   - I mean, it did seem like Nazi Germany,
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:54.240]   I don't know if the Holocaust was the thing
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:38:55.440]   that made it most coverable.
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:57.280]   I think it was that this is a threat
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:38:59.320]   to the entire civilization.
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:00.960]   - Well, yeah, we were at war with them, yeah.
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:02.440]   - That's what makes it coverable.
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:04.240]   And if the Holocaust was happening
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:06.780]   just inside that country, inside of Germany.
[02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:10.400]   Or even if it didn't expand beyond Poland.
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:13.000]   - Yeah, it would be like a footnote.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:14.280]   It was in many ways a footnote.
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:16.600]   Like, many of the early steps toward it was like,
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:17.440]   they didn't cover it.
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:18.260]   It's just like, all right,
[02:39:18.260 --> 02:39:20.240]   they're being oppressive toward their own people, okay.
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:21.760]   - Especially given some of the,
[02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:25.240]   maybe if you negotiate certain peace treaties
[02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:26.720]   with the Soviet Union and with Germany.
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:30.320]   Like, you're too, the pacifist imperative.
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:32.640]   Oh, boy.
[02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:35.100]   Sorry, Santa.
[02:39:35.100 --> 02:39:39.640]   - Is that what you say every time you masturbate?
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:42.560]   No, after you're done.
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:43.600]   You know, sorry.
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:44.920]   I apologize.
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:46.080]   All right.
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:48.600]   Now, see, I hate it when you don't yes and,
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:51.820]   because it leaves me in a hole I dug for myself.
[02:39:51.820 --> 02:39:55.200]   And I sit there in a hole.
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:58.360]   In my sadness.
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:00.960]   How long have you been writing this book?
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:02.080]   I mean, how long? - Two years.
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:03.360]   - Mentally, it was like two years.
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:05.280]   Since you spend time with it.
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:09.120]   - No, almost three, two and a half, yeah.
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:11.480]   - And I suppose it stays with you much longer.
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:12.880]   Like you said, your family.
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:16.040]   So, in many ways, this is a book
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:17.760]   you've been writing your whole life.
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:18.600]   - I think that's fair
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:21.080]   that all my work's been leading to this, yeah.
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:22.480]   It's certainly the most, in my opinion,
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:24.240]   the most important thing I've done.
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:29.200]   - What stands out to you about Haldemar?
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:32.700]   What moments, what aspects of human nature stand out to you?
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:35.820]   (phone beeps)
[02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:38.540]   - I don't know, I think that story is,
[02:40:38.540 --> 02:40:43.060]   I don't wanna say story, but I meant like that incident is,
[02:40:43.060 --> 02:40:44.900]   I mean, I was familiar with it before,
[02:40:44.900 --> 02:40:45.740]   you know what I mean?
[02:40:45.740 --> 02:40:47.740]   So I kinda knew about it, you know,
[02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:50.140]   in part thanks to kind of the North Korean work
[02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:52.600]   and coming from Ukraine.
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:56.580]   The thing that was also kind of insane about it
[02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:59.220]   is that they were taking all this grain
[02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:01.220]   and not using it even to feed the Russian people.
[02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:03.720]   They were selling it for export for hard currency.
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:10.500]   I think what the takeaway there,
[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:12.580]   and I think, again, this is something Westerners
[02:41:12.580 --> 02:41:15.500]   and especially Americans don't appreciate,
[02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:20.500]   they think that evil often has like a logic to it, right?
[02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:24.620]   And it's like, why would,
[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:26.420]   like, because it makes no sense to them,
[02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:29.220]   like, why would they kill their own people?
[02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:31.140]   Therefore, it probably didn't happen, right?
[02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:32.620]   There's that thing.
[02:41:32.620 --> 02:41:34.540]   They really think like, okay,
[02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:38.740]   they can understand country A conquers country B
[02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:40.940]   and slaughters a bunch of people country B
[02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:42.100]   as a means of conquest.
[02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:44.500]   Like that kind of makes sense to them, they know that thing.
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:47.860]   But like, why are you starving all these people?
[02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:49.380]   Like, what are you gaining out of it?
[02:41:49.380 --> 02:41:51.500]   That doesn't make sense to them.
[02:41:51.500 --> 02:41:52.820]   And because it doesn't make sense,
[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:54.340]   there's kind of like, well,
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:56.060]   it's probably more of the story that I'm hearing.
[02:41:56.060 --> 02:41:58.060]   And a lot of times there's not,
[02:41:58.060 --> 02:42:01.020]   it's just like evil for the sake of power.
[02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:05.380]   And we don't really have that,
[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:09.020]   certainly anywhere near that scale and never have,
[02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:13.900]   certainly since America has been a thing.
[02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:18.420]   I mean, it's, and the fact that this is like the 30s,
[02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:19.260]   you know what I mean?
[02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:21.100]   This isn't that long ago.
[02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:26.100]   But I think also the narrative in some ways is
[02:42:26.100 --> 02:42:30.380]   how technology is also something
[02:42:30.380 --> 02:42:33.140]   that kind of people have mixed feelings about.
[02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:34.220]   Like I said this before,
[02:42:34.220 --> 02:42:36.820]   and this is something I really believe very strongly,
[02:42:36.820 --> 02:42:41.100]   the ability of information to be captured and spread easily
[02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:46.100]   is such an effective tool in exposing humanity at its worst.
[02:42:46.100 --> 02:42:51.380]   Because it's one thing if I sit here
[02:42:51.380 --> 02:42:54.860]   and tell you what I saw in these villages,
[02:42:54.860 --> 02:42:57.780]   it's another thing if I sat you down and showed you a YouTube
[02:42:57.780 --> 02:42:59.900]   and you and I don't know what it's like
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:02.300]   to look in the eyes of someone who's thinking
[02:43:02.300 --> 02:43:04.300]   about eating their own kids.
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:06.420]   I mean, and you see that face
[02:43:06.420 --> 02:43:11.100]   and you know it's not some CGI, it will haunt you forever.
[02:43:11.100 --> 02:43:14.540]   - Just looking at the different mechanisms
[02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:15.900]   that made all of this happen.
[02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:19.340]   So this is not just one guy, Stalin, having a policy.
[02:43:19.340 --> 02:43:20.660]   There's a whole system.
[02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:25.380]   I mean, one of it is just a system of fear.
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:28.100]   But how do you implement that system of fear?
[02:43:28.100 --> 02:43:28.940]   - Well--
[02:43:28.940 --> 02:43:30.460]   - There's a giant bureaucracy of fear.
[02:43:30.460 --> 02:43:35.180]   - Yeah, so what he implemented with the Great Terror is--
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:37.340]   - That's in the late 30s.
[02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:39.540]   - Well, it's throughout the 30s, but yeah,
[02:43:39.540 --> 02:43:43.420]   like it starts in the mid to late 30s.
[02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:47.460]   Basically, communism is based on the common good
[02:43:47.460 --> 02:43:48.860]   and the public good.
[02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:52.060]   And anything private, which was bourgeois, was a problem.
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:55.100]   When they were started, when the revolution came,
[02:43:55.100 --> 02:43:56.380]   the October Revolution,
[02:43:56.380 --> 02:43:59.020]   they wanted to recreate society entirely.
[02:43:59.020 --> 02:44:01.660]   And that included like, okay, let's make it so
[02:44:01.660 --> 02:44:05.380]   everyone eats in like cafeterias,
[02:44:05.380 --> 02:44:06.620]   so they're not eating by themselves.
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:09.460]   Let's design buildings so everyone has to share bathrooms.
[02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:11.740]   Like their whole plan was to have,
[02:44:11.740 --> 02:44:14.500]   eliminate any kind of concept of privacy at all.
[02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:16.700]   They also had this bizarre kind of radical idea
[02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:19.060]   of like attacking shame.
[02:44:19.060 --> 02:44:21.660]   So many of these, before the 1917,
[02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:24.580]   people were also very involved with like free love,
[02:44:24.580 --> 02:44:26.700]   'cause the idea of like having this private bond
[02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:29.100]   between husband and wife was also bourgeois and old fashioned
[02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:31.700]   and we're the society of the future.
[02:44:31.700 --> 02:44:33.900]   That changed relatively quickly,
[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:34.900]   but they were talking about things
[02:44:34.900 --> 02:44:38.740]   like raising kids communally and so on and so forth.
[02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:42.580]   So for Stalin, if you and I are friends,
[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:45.380]   we have a bond that's a threat to him.
[02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:47.300]   The family's a threat.
[02:44:47.300 --> 02:44:48.980]   Any kind of organization is a threat
[02:44:48.980 --> 02:44:53.180]   'cause it's a power center that is not between,
[02:44:53.180 --> 02:44:54.180]   a relationship between you and him.
[02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:55.820]   Now you have a relationship with somebody else.
[02:44:55.820 --> 02:45:00.820]   So he systemically went through that whole society
[02:45:00.820 --> 02:45:06.220]   and it became, there were certain things that became a crime.
[02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:08.860]   Then it became a crime to be a spouse
[02:45:08.860 --> 02:45:10.340]   of the enemy of the people.
[02:45:10.340 --> 02:45:13.220]   Now right away, I as a child become an orphan
[02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:15.140]   'cause my dad was an enemy of the people.
[02:45:15.140 --> 02:45:17.740]   My mom is married to an enemy of the people.
[02:45:17.740 --> 02:45:18.820]   Now I don't have parents.
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:21.100]   They get arrested or executed or whatever.
[02:45:21.100 --> 02:45:23.220]   But now I have nowhere to go,
[02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:25.400]   but I can't go to my friend's house
[02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:27.540]   because their family doesn't wanna take in a child
[02:45:27.540 --> 02:45:29.420]   at the enemy of the people.
[02:45:29.420 --> 02:45:33.700]   You had this culture where everyone was very much encouraged
[02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:35.340]   to turn people in.
[02:45:35.340 --> 02:45:39.500]   And if you're arrested and tortured,
[02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:41.780]   you're like, okay, who are your accomplices?
[02:45:41.780 --> 02:45:44.460]   And now you just gotta name names people you knew.
[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:46.060]   And then it becomes this whole chain.
[02:45:46.060 --> 02:45:48.460]   And it's like, how am I gonna protest my innocence
[02:45:48.460 --> 02:45:53.180]   if Lex just said, I worked with Michael
[02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:55.100]   and we were working with Trotskyists
[02:45:55.100 --> 02:45:56.940]   and we were plotting to overthrow Stalin.
[02:45:56.940 --> 02:45:58.960]   Lex testified to this.
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:00.140]   He signed a confession.
[02:46:00.140 --> 02:46:01.780]   What am I supposed to do now?
[02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:05.100]   So it worked its way in a most viral fashion
[02:46:05.100 --> 02:46:06.140]   through the whole society.
[02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:10.100]   There was this amazing moment where these poor people,
[02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:11.620]   peasants, 'cause obviously the powerless
[02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:13.780]   are often gonna be caught in the web.
[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:17.140]   They were going to jail for being Trotskyites
[02:46:17.140 --> 02:46:19.340]   and they had to ask themselves, what's a Tractorist?
[02:46:19.340 --> 02:46:21.780]   Like they didn't even know who Trotsky was.
[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:25.260]   And the other thing is ethnicity was a problem, right?
[02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:28.620]   If you were an ethnicity, you have more power
[02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:30.860]   with other members of that ethnicity
[02:46:30.860 --> 02:46:33.580]   than you have with this kind of broader Soviet culture.
[02:46:33.580 --> 02:46:37.020]   So he would just deport entire populations
[02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:39.420]   from their ancestral lands to other parts,
[02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:41.060]   A, to spread the population around,
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:44.340]   but also to break that link between the peoples
[02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:45.220]   and their lands.
[02:46:45.220 --> 02:46:49.260]   There was this 1937 NKVD order against Polish people
[02:46:49.260 --> 02:46:51.820]   where it's just like, if you had come from Poland
[02:46:51.820 --> 02:46:54.660]   or had been, just this whole list,
[02:46:54.660 --> 02:46:56.260]   and basically people were being arrested
[02:46:56.260 --> 02:46:59.020]   'cause they had Polish last names.
[02:46:59.020 --> 02:47:02.060]   And I think it was a million people were killed,
[02:47:02.060 --> 02:47:04.420]   like some astronomical number.
[02:47:04.420 --> 02:47:08.700]   So there was this, anything that was a bond
[02:47:08.700 --> 02:47:10.020]   was a threat to him.
[02:47:10.020 --> 02:47:12.020]   And it went systemically.
[02:47:12.020 --> 02:47:15.260]   So after he had all these kind of executions
[02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:18.100]   of people who were like Lenin's people, the old Bolsheviks,
[02:47:18.100 --> 02:47:21.660]   then he went after, he started arresting the secret police.
[02:47:21.660 --> 02:47:24.260]   He arrested all the cops, he arrested all the judges,
[02:47:24.260 --> 02:47:26.980]   and all these prisoners got to see the judges
[02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:28.980]   who yelled at them for being counter-revolutionaries
[02:47:28.980 --> 02:47:31.140]   and spies, now they were in the jails.
[02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:34.420]   If you were a foreigner, there was a huge push
[02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:37.300]   from the Soviet Union toward African-Americans, right?
[02:47:37.300 --> 02:47:38.500]   'Cause they're like, look, you were living
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:43.500]   in a racist country, here we have no racial inequality,
[02:47:43.500 --> 02:47:45.660]   come live here.
[02:47:45.660 --> 02:47:48.620]   A bunch of them went and they were all vanished.
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:50.620]   Anyone who knew information about the outside world,
[02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:53.740]   if you were a foreigner, Andre Babel,
[02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:56.380]   I forget his first name, he had a French writer
[02:47:56.380 --> 02:47:58.260]   he was friends with, he was arrested and shot
[02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:00.460]   'cause he's a spy, 'cause you're friends with Melrose.
[02:48:00.460 --> 02:48:02.420]   And that means if you're not a foreigner, you're a spy.
[02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:04.660]   Speaking Esperanto became a crime.
[02:48:04.660 --> 02:48:06.940]   Having a pen pal, literally anything
[02:48:06.940 --> 02:48:09.260]   that was some kind of chain between yourself
[02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:13.300]   and someone else was a threat and was grounds for arrest.
[02:48:13.300 --> 02:48:17.860]   It was, the Russians would joke about how relieved
[02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:19.900]   they would be if someone knocked on your door
[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:22.140]   in the middle of the night to tell you your house was on fire
[02:48:22.140 --> 02:48:24.780]   'cause it wasn't the NKVD coming to arrest you.
[02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:26.380]   - And of course, most of the accusations
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:28.860]   probably were completely false.
[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:31.820]   So not only 'cause you not do all of those things,
[02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:35.620]   you were also a victim of just random--
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:37.820]   - Being late to work became a felony.
[02:48:37.820 --> 02:48:40.220]   And also not doing your job became a felony
[02:48:40.220 --> 02:48:43.980]   'cause now you're taking food or product away
[02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:45.500]   from the people and you're supposed to be there
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:46.820]   working for the people.
[02:48:46.820 --> 02:48:50.180]   There's this one story which I was doing the audio book
[02:48:50.180 --> 02:48:51.900]   and this is like, I still trying to get through
[02:48:51.900 --> 02:48:53.940]   without crying, this was 1920.
[02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:57.020]   They were a bunch of kids in Moscow who were pickpockets
[02:48:57.020 --> 02:48:58.860]   between ages 11 and 15.
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:00.420]   They rounded them up and they're like,
[02:49:00.420 --> 02:49:02.180]   "All right, point out your accomplices."
[02:49:02.180 --> 02:49:03.620]   And they would take them in the trams
[02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:04.980]   and you have to point out people,
[02:49:04.980 --> 02:49:07.500]   then they would take them back to the cellar,
[02:49:07.500 --> 02:49:09.900]   beat the crap out of these children
[02:49:09.900 --> 02:49:11.060]   and then they take them out again.
[02:49:11.060 --> 02:49:12.700]   And if they didn't point out to anybody,
[02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:13.940]   they beat them, they're like, "All right."
[02:49:13.940 --> 02:49:15.700]   So they just start pointing at random.
[02:49:15.700 --> 02:49:17.660]   And the thing that was really sick about this story,
[02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:19.420]   if that wasn't sick enough,
[02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:22.780]   is that the screams that the other criminals,
[02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:25.500]   the adult hardened criminals had to hear from these children
[02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:28.300]   as they realized they were being taken back to the cellar.
[02:49:28.300 --> 02:49:30.340]   It was just horrifying.
[02:49:33.900 --> 02:49:36.140]   - So they tortured people,
[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:37.860]   they tortured confessions out of people.
[02:49:37.860 --> 02:49:38.940]   - Yes.
[02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:40.020]   - At scale.
[02:49:40.020 --> 02:49:40.860]   - Oh, yes.
[02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:45.140]   - And the dark aspect of this is it's all,
[02:49:45.140 --> 02:49:50.100]   it's like this weird, it's a bureaucracy of torture.
[02:49:50.100 --> 02:49:50.940]   - Yes.
[02:49:50.940 --> 02:49:54.460]   - So it's not like there's, what is it?
[02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:56.540]   The torturer is afraid of,
[02:49:56.540 --> 02:50:00.500]   like does it so that he doesn't become the prisoner.
[02:50:00.500 --> 02:50:02.020]   - Right, because then it's like,
[02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:04.420]   "Oh, you couldn't get a confession out of him?
[02:50:04.420 --> 02:50:06.620]   "Are you an enemy that people know as well?"
[02:50:06.620 --> 02:50:08.660]   And the thing that was even crazier
[02:50:08.660 --> 02:50:11.940]   is that a lot of these interrogators were frustrated
[02:50:11.940 --> 02:50:15.500]   'cause they're like, "Look, we both know you're innocent.
[02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:17.940]   "Just sign this confession and make my life easier."
[02:50:17.940 --> 02:50:19.300]   They knew it was crap.
[02:50:19.300 --> 02:50:22.780]   Stalin joked about, Stalin joked about this.
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:24.380]   This is one of his little jokes.
[02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:29.220]   There was a kid who was arrested and he was said,
[02:50:29.220 --> 02:50:32.900]   oh, was forced to say, "You wrote Eugene Onegin,"
[02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:33.740]   which is a play.
[02:50:33.740 --> 02:50:35.100]   He goes, "That play was by Pushkin."
[02:50:35.100 --> 02:50:37.180]   And they tortured him and they tortured him, tortured him.
[02:50:37.180 --> 02:50:39.100]   And then his parents are walking down the street
[02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:40.780]   and they run into a secret police and they go,
[02:50:40.780 --> 02:50:41.780]   "Congratulations."
[02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:42.620]   And they go, "For what?"
[02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:44.900]   They go, "Your son wrote Eugene Onegin.
[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:46.060]   "He admitted to it last night."
[02:50:46.060 --> 02:50:49.100]   Like, it's just like they could get you to say anything
[02:50:49.100 --> 02:50:51.220]   and what else was really, really sick,
[02:50:51.220 --> 02:50:55.580]   which they understood, is they lowered the death penalty
[02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:57.540]   for kids, I think it's either 14 or 12.
[02:50:57.540 --> 02:50:59.100]   I don't remember off the top of my head.
[02:50:59.100 --> 02:51:02.380]   And what Stalin's head of the secret police did
[02:51:02.380 --> 02:51:05.380]   is when you were interrogating someone,
[02:51:05.380 --> 02:51:08.980]   you either had to have some of that family member's
[02:51:08.980 --> 02:51:13.660]   possessions on the desk or a copy of the decree
[02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:16.940]   that's saying that they can go after your family.
[02:51:16.940 --> 02:51:19.420]   And the amount of people who would confess to anything
[02:51:19.420 --> 02:51:21.500]   when they saw their family was in danger
[02:51:21.500 --> 02:51:25.100]   and they knew this wasn't a bluff, was astronomical.
[02:51:25.100 --> 02:51:26.460]   And then it becomes a chain.
[02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:28.820]   'Cause if you confess and I have your confession,
[02:51:28.820 --> 02:51:30.620]   how hard is it to get your neighbor?
[02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:35.220]   - What do you make of the, for most of the time,
[02:51:35.220 --> 02:51:39.580]   the NKVD was about the head of NKVD,
[02:51:39.580 --> 02:51:41.700]   Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria.
[02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:42.700]   - No, Beria, yeah.
[02:51:42.700 --> 02:51:45.340]   I have a death warrant signed by him
[02:51:45.340 --> 02:51:48.820]   hanging in my kitchen that I acquired.
[02:51:48.820 --> 02:51:52.080]   He was one of the most evil people who ever lived.
[02:51:52.080 --> 02:51:55.380]   The thing that Americans don't appreciate
[02:51:55.380 --> 02:52:00.260]   is how clever some of this sadism is.
[02:52:00.260 --> 02:52:01.860]   So there was one actress,
[02:52:01.860 --> 02:52:04.580]   I think he took her back to his house
[02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:07.100]   and he asked her to, he tried to get her to sleep with him.
[02:52:07.100 --> 02:52:09.220]   And he promised her that if she did,
[02:52:09.220 --> 02:52:11.820]   her father and either her husband or her grandfather,
[02:52:11.820 --> 02:52:12.660]   I don't remember which one it was,
[02:52:12.660 --> 02:52:13.940]   is gonna be released from jail.
[02:52:13.940 --> 02:52:15.220]   Well, they were already dead at that point.
[02:52:15.220 --> 02:52:17.060]   He had them executed.
[02:52:17.060 --> 02:52:20.420]   They're still finding the bodies of the women he murdered
[02:52:20.420 --> 02:52:23.100]   in the grounds of his dacha, it's an embassy now.
[02:52:23.100 --> 02:52:24.620]   And the thing is Stalin knew,
[02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:25.740]   'cause at one point Stalin,
[02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:28.260]   there's a picture of Stalin's daughter in his lap,
[02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:30.580]   and she was at his house one day and Stalin calls up,
[02:52:30.580 --> 02:52:32.020]   he goes, "Get out of there immediately."
[02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:35.140]   So he, like a good bureaucrat,
[02:52:35.140 --> 02:52:38.340]   he kept a list of all of his sexual partners.
[02:52:38.340 --> 02:52:40.940]   It's still sealed,
[02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:43.500]   but both him and his bodyguard had this list.
[02:52:43.500 --> 02:52:46.820]   - So just to clarify, he headed the operation
[02:52:46.820 --> 02:52:51.340]   that did this whole giant mechanism of forced confessions.
[02:52:51.340 --> 02:52:53.140]   He was part of expanding the Gulags,
[02:52:53.140 --> 02:52:54.380]   so he wasn't the head of the Gulags,
[02:52:54.380 --> 02:52:55.940]   but he was part of this giant machine.
[02:52:55.940 --> 02:52:57.020]   - And his famous quote was,
[02:52:57.020 --> 02:52:59.140]   "Show me the man and I'll show you the crime."
[02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:00.300]   - Yeah.
[02:53:00.300 --> 02:53:02.340]   But on top of that, what you're describing
[02:53:02.340 --> 02:53:05.580]   is he was also, related or not,
[02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:07.900]   was also just a mass rapist.
[02:53:07.900 --> 02:53:09.620]   - Yes, and there's some dispute
[02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:11.780]   about whether he went after kids with his rapes,
[02:53:11.780 --> 02:53:16.020]   but there's plenty of adult women that were targets for this.
[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:17.620]   There was also another little joke about him
[02:53:17.620 --> 02:53:19.660]   about how Stalin is looking for his pipe
[02:53:19.660 --> 02:53:21.700]   and he can't find it and he calls Beria,
[02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:23.500]   and he's like, "Okay, I can't find this pipe."
[02:53:23.500 --> 02:53:24.940]   And in the afternoon he calls Beria again,
[02:53:24.940 --> 02:53:25.820]   he's like, "Oh, I found the pipe."
[02:53:25.820 --> 02:53:26.980]   He goes, "But Comrade Stalin,
[02:53:26.980 --> 02:53:29.380]   "we've got four people to confess to steal it already."
[02:53:29.380 --> 02:53:31.620]   So you have to laugh, but then you think about the nature
[02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:32.940]   of how it operates.
[02:53:32.940 --> 02:53:35.580]   - Well, and also the fact that this kind of person
[02:53:35.580 --> 02:53:39.380]   was allowed to run, I mean, I suppose,
[02:53:39.380 --> 02:53:42.020]   it's all different kinds of evil,
[02:53:42.020 --> 02:53:44.500]   and rape was just a part of the story.
[02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:49.180]   His own personal willingness to oversee torture
[02:53:51.940 --> 02:53:55.100]   and commit torture himself and rape.
[02:53:55.100 --> 02:53:57.340]   - But it's also what happens when you're in a country
[02:53:57.340 --> 02:53:59.700]   where it has no rights of any kind.
[02:53:59.700 --> 02:54:01.540]   - And by the way, I should mention
[02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:04.740]   that people should get your book and audio,
[02:54:04.740 --> 02:54:05.860]   when is your audio book coming out?
[02:54:05.860 --> 02:54:08.620]   - It's in a couple of weeks, so it'll be out shortly, yeah.
[02:54:08.620 --> 02:54:12.180]   - You gave me the great honor of voicing this man.
[02:54:12.180 --> 02:54:13.380]   - That's for the promo.
[02:54:13.380 --> 02:54:14.220]   - Yeah, for the promo.
[02:54:14.220 --> 02:54:15.820]   - Yeah, the video. - Excellent.
[02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:17.080]   I appreciate that.
[02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:20.880]   For a moment, I actually,
[02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:23.560]   it was really difficult.
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:24.760]   - Really? - Yeah.
[02:54:24.760 --> 02:54:26.080]   - It was just a sentence.
[02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:27.960]   - I understand, I understand.
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:33.080]   'Cause it takes you to that place.
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:34.400]   - Oh yeah, 'cause he told her,
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:36.520]   "Scream if you want, doesn't matter."
[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:39.160]   And he was right, that's the thing, he wasn't bluffing.
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:41.360]   You could scream, these women could scream their head off,
[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:43.000]   no one's gonna come help him.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:44.600]   He would drive around Moscow at night
[02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:46.640]   in his limo looking for victims.
[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:48.920]   - But somehow me saying those words was tough.
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:49.760]   - I'm sure.
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:51.940]   - It was tough.
[02:54:51.940 --> 02:54:55.480]   - Because this is where we came from,
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:56.320]   do you know what I mean?
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:00.040]   This isn't just some kind of Tolkien villain.
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:02.280]   - But it also was tough 'cause I could see myself
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:04.360]   being somewhere in that machine somewhere.
[02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:06.080]   Somehow that put me right there.
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:15.440]   Any cog in that machine is committing evil.
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:16.640]   - Yes.
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:17.880]   - That's the dark thing.
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:23.720]   I think the higher you are to the top,
[02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:26.040]   the closer you are to the top,
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:29.600]   the more ability you have to stop it.
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:35.360]   But the less, the more freedom you have to stop it,
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:36.200]   I suppose.
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:39.080]   - To a point, yeah.
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:40.560]   - But like the little things.
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:47.000]   So Beria had the freedom to commit rape, or not to.
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:53.000]   And so he chooses to sort of increase the amount of evil
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.840]   he's putting out into the world.
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:57.600]   - But then you have to counterbalance that,
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:55:59.800]   as dark as this calculus is,
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:04.040]   after Stalin dies, that week they start
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:06.080]   making the gulag shrink.
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:09.360]   They start pulling back on the labor camps.
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:15.760]   So that is a big plus in his side.
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:18.080]   You start liberating, having this mass amnesty
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:21.440]   and freeing people from work camps.
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:22.760]   That's not minor things.
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:24.200]   So it's crazy.
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:27.440]   It's like, I'm not Saint Peter, right?
[02:56:27.440 --> 02:56:30.520]   I don't know, I'm not saying he's a good person,
[02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:33.920]   but it's kind of insane that someone can do things
[02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:37.920]   that everyone listening to this would regard as pure evil.
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:42.560]   And at the same time, this guy also, when the time came,
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:45.480]   saved tens of thousands of lives.
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:48.760]   - So in some sense, Stalin is the kind of cancer
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:51.800]   that permeates all the Soviet minds.
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:54.120]   And once it's gone, you almost wake up,
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:57.400]   "Wait a minute, what the fuck was I a part of?"
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:56:59.920]   - And Khrushchev, it was in '56,
[02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:03.980]   when he gave a secret speech behind closed doors,
[02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:07.120]   and he's just like, "All this criticism of Stalin was true.
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:09.000]   "This is completely not what Marxism,
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:09.900]   "he tried to salvage the system.
[02:57:09.900 --> 02:57:11.520]   "This is not what Marxism's about.
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:14.080]   "We can't have a personality cult.
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:17.680]   "Stalin killed all these top generals,
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:20.780]   "and when Hitler betrayed the pact and invaded,
[02:57:20.780 --> 02:57:23.200]   "Stalin didn't believe his buddy Hitler was gonna do this.
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:24.160]   "And as a result of this,
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:25.820]   "we lost a lot of territory and lives.
[02:57:25.820 --> 02:57:27.320]   "This is not a military genius.
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:31.280]   "This was Stalin being an idiot or a moron,"
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:33.200]   whatever term you wanna be.
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:38.200]   So, yeah, but the thing is, Khrushchev also was a butcher.
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:40.520]   He had a lot of blood on his hands.
[02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:43.160]   You don't take Stalin's seat
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:46.040]   without having overlooked a lot of murder and chaos.
[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:49.720]   So, it's such a,
[02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:50.600]   that's why it's called,
[02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:52.600]   the subtitle of the book's "A Tale of Good and Evil."
[02:57:52.600 --> 02:57:55.680]   There's so much malevolence to go around.
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:57:59.920]   - What do you think was going through Stalin's mind
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:01.600]   in the '20s and the '30s?
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:13.000]   Did he directly allow himself to acknowledge
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:16.880]   the reality of the suffering he was causing?
[02:58:16.880 --> 02:58:19.280]   Like, what does it take to be that human?
[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:23.040]   I'm almost interested to extract lessons from that
[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:24.500]   for leaders of today.
[02:58:24.500 --> 02:58:26.800]   Like, how hard is it?
[02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:28.920]   Is it that Stalin is evil,
[02:58:28.920 --> 02:58:32.320]   or can you just delude yourself gradually
[02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:34.300]   into where you don't have a sense
[02:58:34.300 --> 02:58:36.720]   of the effect of your policies on the populace?
[02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:38.440]   - Well, you're not deluding yourself
[02:58:38.440 --> 02:58:42.360]   because you have around you an entire government
[02:58:42.360 --> 02:58:46.400]   of people telling you 24/7 how great you are,
[02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:47.640]   how thankful they are for you,
[02:58:47.640 --> 02:58:49.560]   how awesome you are, you're the best.
[02:58:49.560 --> 02:58:52.480]   So, that certainly gonna play into it.
[02:58:52.480 --> 02:58:54.320]   I've asked myself that question as well.
[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:56.400]   Like, do these people believe their own bullshit?
[02:58:56.400 --> 02:58:59.840]   And I think the receipts are,
[02:58:59.840 --> 02:59:01.120]   when Elena Ceausescu,
[02:59:01.120 --> 02:59:03.120]   who's one of the four women on the cover,
[02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:07.160]   when she's being taken away to be executed in 1989,
[02:59:07.160 --> 02:59:08.680]   she's yelling at the soldiers,
[02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:09.520]   "How could you?
[02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:10.960]   I raised you like a mother."
[02:59:10.960 --> 02:59:13.520]   So, she at least believed her own bullshit.
[02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:18.780]   With Stalin, he was obviously extremely intelligent.
[02:59:18.780 --> 02:59:22.960]   I think it's kind of easy for us to kind of psychologize
[02:59:22.960 --> 02:59:25.200]   and say he's a sociopath, he's a narcissist,
[02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:26.280]   he's this, he's that.
[02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:29.520]   But at a certain point,
[02:59:29.520 --> 02:59:33.480]   like if you're surrounded by a culture
[02:59:33.480 --> 02:59:35.520]   dedicated to glorifying you,
[02:59:35.520 --> 02:59:38.280]   and everyone you meet is so happy to see you,
[02:59:38.280 --> 02:59:41.400]   and oh my God, all your pronouncements are so good.
[02:59:41.400 --> 02:59:42.600]   And you know what?
[02:59:42.600 --> 02:59:44.440]   If you make a decision that's wrong,
[02:59:44.440 --> 02:59:45.320]   the people around you,
[02:59:45.320 --> 02:59:47.680]   it's their job to tell you why it's not your fault,
[02:59:47.680 --> 02:59:49.120]   it's the fault of the wreckers,
[02:59:49.120 --> 02:59:52.920]   or it's the fault of Hitler, or whoever it is, the kulaks.
[02:59:52.920 --> 02:59:54.680]   At a certain point,
[02:59:54.680 --> 02:59:58.720]   the human mind wants to believe how great it is,
[02:59:58.720 --> 03:00:00.920]   especially someone in that vaunted position.
[03:00:00.920 --> 03:00:04.120]   But he had his low,
[03:00:04.120 --> 03:00:06.120]   there was this one funny,
[03:00:06.120 --> 03:00:07.800]   I'm using the word loosely, quote,
[03:00:07.800 --> 03:00:10.200]   when Hitler invades Russia,
[03:00:10.200 --> 03:00:11.760]   and he couldn't believe it,
[03:00:11.760 --> 03:00:14.080]   and he's just missing in action for days,
[03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:15.320]   'cause how could Hitler betray me?
[03:00:15.320 --> 03:00:17.520]   We had a deal, birds of a feather.
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:18.840]   And he had this quote about like,
[03:00:18.840 --> 03:00:21.800]   "We've taken Lenin's legacy and shitted out our asses."
[03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:23.560]   I think he was very aware,
[03:00:23.560 --> 03:00:25.640]   that's no question that he was aware
[03:00:25.640 --> 03:00:29.000]   that in terms of being a philosopher or a thinker,
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:30.920]   he wasn't on Lenin's level, right?
[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:34.860]   So that was, I'm sure, played a lot into his psychology.
[03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:37.640]   That he never quite lived up to the,
[03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:39.640]   like everything he tried.
[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:40.800]   I mean, there's some sense of that,
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:42.140]   the collectivization,
[03:00:42.140 --> 03:00:45.860]   that this idea was a failure.
[03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:51.360]   The way he responds to the economic policy being a failure,
[03:00:51.360 --> 03:00:52.720]   is to lean in,
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:57.180]   and basically torture anyone who says it's a failure,
[03:00:57.180 --> 03:00:59.520]   and double down on the policy.
[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:00.760]   Like that says something about--
[03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:03.880]   - But it wasn't a failure, it broke the Ukrainians.
[03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:06.960]   You don't think he believed early on,
[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:08.980]   that's what it turned into,
[03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:12.120]   but you don't think in the very early days,
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:14.600]   there was a thought that collectivization
[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:19.600]   is the right mechanism by which to enact communism.
[03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:24.600]   - But I think his goal was to break their spirit,
[03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:28.920]   and getting them fed was secondary, right?
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:32.040]   And given the fact that they stopped complaining,
[03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:35.560]   'cause they're dead, he got what he wanted.
[03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:37.920]   He got a compliant population.
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:40.080]   - I mean, that's really interesting.
[03:01:40.080 --> 03:01:43.860]   I didn't, I wonder how much disagreement there is about,
[03:01:43.860 --> 03:01:47.160]   because if that was the goal from the beginning,
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:49.240]   that's a different level of evil.
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:50.440]   - I think that was clearly the goal.
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:52.680]   So his, like I said earlier,
[03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:54.800]   he broke with Lenin 'cause he wanted socialism
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:55.640]   in one country, right?
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:01:57.000]   That was his vision, right?
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:00.840]   And he was also very aware that what became the Soviet Union
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:03.800]   was extremely diverse, first of all, it's gigantic country,
[03:02:03.800 --> 03:02:05.000]   it's the big country on earth.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:08.780]   It's not always gigantic, you had all these peoples,
[03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:10.680]   these nationalities within it
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:12.520]   that have had historical enmity,
[03:02:12.520 --> 03:02:14.320]   and they're not gonna have loyalty to Moscow.
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:16.880]   He's a Georgian himself, this was always a big problem.
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:20.040]   So that was what he wanted to do as well,
[03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:23.320]   is to homogenize and have them be standardized.
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:26.120]   And I don't see how you do that
[03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:28.560]   without either massive re-education,
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:30.520]   which is only gonna go so far,
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:34.240]   or really just crushing people's spirits.
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:40.360]   - So like a forced homogeneity.
[03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:41.200]   - Yeah.
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:44.520]   And the other big thing,
[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:49.200]   a big element of Soviet culture and the Soviet mythology,
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:51.160]   I mean, he called, his name was,
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:52.520]   he changed his name to Stalin,
[03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:53.640]   I can't even pronounce his Georgian name,
[03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:55.040]   Djokas Vili or something like that.
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:56.560]   It means man of steel.
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:02:58.080]   So a large part of the,
[03:02:58.080 --> 03:03:00.480]   and this still remains in Russian culture to this day.
[03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:03.440]   I see in my family too, and like other Russians I know,
[03:03:03.440 --> 03:03:06.360]   there is this pride in ruthlessness,
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:08.360]   and this kind of like, I'm so tough,
[03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:09.680]   nothing's gonna affect me.
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:11.460]   Like, yeah, we're gonna suffer,
[03:03:11.460 --> 03:03:13.560]   but it's for a greater good or for the long-term,
[03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:16.720]   and not to be kind of sentimental or squeamish about things.
[03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:18.080]   Like that was a big part of it.
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:20.400]   - Don't take that away from me too, Michael.
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:21.760]   - What do you mean? - You've taken everything.
[03:03:21.760 --> 03:03:23.160]   - Am I wrong?
[03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:28.160]   - I admire, not stoicism, but that kind of hardness.
[03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:32.440]   I look forward to myself, that has nothing to do with Stalin.
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:34.160]   - But not to the extent that like, if some,
[03:03:34.160 --> 03:03:39.160]   like for example, like if you see someone suffering,
[03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:42.640]   and that's being used as a mechanism
[03:03:42.640 --> 03:03:43.720]   to get you to change your opinion,
[03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:45.600]   you're like, they're not gonna get to me.
[03:03:45.600 --> 03:03:48.000]   Like that is very much part of that Russian psychology.
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:48.840]   - Right.
[03:03:48.840 --> 03:03:51.200]   At least at that time.
[03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:53.380]   - Yes, I think still largely no.
[03:03:53.380 --> 03:03:56.360]   I'm not gonna be manipulated
[03:03:56.360 --> 03:03:58.840]   by someone else's suffering or weakness, that kind of thing.
[03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:01.040]   I think that's really part of it to this day.
[03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:04.040]   - I don't know, I don't know how much of it is character,
[03:04:04.040 --> 03:04:05.080]   how much of it is reality.
[03:04:05.080 --> 03:04:06.000]   - Sure, sure.
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:12.520]   I remember, I knew of someone who was,
[03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:14.960]   him and his fiance were Russian,
[03:04:14.960 --> 03:04:18.720]   and they had this big fight, she took off the ring, right?
[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:22.200]   And she's like, he's like, that's it?
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:24.600]   And just like the way he told the story to me,
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:26.080]   she's like, what do you want me to say?
[03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:27.800]   Oh, don't leave me, baby.
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:29.320]   I can't live without you.
[03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:31.920]   Like that nasty cruelty.
[03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:34.400]   - I don't know, man, I know you're,
[03:04:34.400 --> 03:04:36.400]   I don't know if there's a Russian thing,
[03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:38.600]   that's just a people thing.
[03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:40.640]   - I don't think that's an American thing.
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:44.480]   - I think there's all kinds of flavors,
[03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:46.760]   and they're different by region,
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:49.000]   of the way that people are cruel to each other.
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:50.440]   - Sure, I'm not arguing that.
[03:04:50.440 --> 03:04:53.960]   - In America, New Jersey is different than Texas,
[03:04:53.960 --> 03:04:55.160]   is different than California.
[03:04:55.160 --> 03:04:58.920]   - You don't think Americans are a higher trust,
[03:04:58.920 --> 03:05:02.460]   more kind society than Russia, even today?
[03:05:02.460 --> 03:05:06.320]   - Higher trust, listen, I'm not going to,
[03:05:06.320 --> 03:05:10.840]   so first of all, I have very complex feelings
[03:05:10.840 --> 03:05:13.560]   about Russia today.
[03:05:13.560 --> 03:05:15.640]   - I'm talking about, that's like a January before the war,
[03:05:15.640 --> 03:05:17.600]   I'm talking about nowadays.
[03:05:17.600 --> 03:05:20.880]   - I think it's a complex psychological dynamic
[03:05:20.880 --> 03:05:22.040]   of what trusting means.
[03:05:22.040 --> 03:05:26.080]   I think Russians are generally less friendly,
[03:05:26.080 --> 03:05:29.400]   but have more intimate friendships.
[03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:30.800]   - Yes, I think that's true.
[03:05:30.800 --> 03:05:32.800]   - So it's just a different--
[03:05:32.800 --> 03:05:35.920]   - It's not different, it's just one is more trusting.
[03:05:35.920 --> 03:05:36.760]   - Which is more trusting?
[03:05:36.760 --> 03:05:37.640]   - Americans.
[03:05:37.640 --> 03:05:41.920]   - But then, this would define trusting different, because--
[03:05:41.920 --> 03:05:43.040]   - Okay, I'll give you an example.
[03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:44.760]   If someone's having a party in America,
[03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:47.960]   and people come over, okay, that's fine, everyone's welcome.
[03:05:47.960 --> 03:05:50.980]   If it's in Russia, it's like, who's that, who'd you bring?
[03:05:50.980 --> 03:05:53.200]   And there's much more of a, let me be sure that's okay,
[03:05:53.200 --> 03:05:54.040]   this person's here.
[03:05:54.040 --> 03:05:55.560]   - I don't know, maybe.
[03:05:55.560 --> 03:05:57.400]   - You don't have parties.
[03:05:57.400 --> 03:05:59.040]   - I have never been at a party.
[03:05:59.040 --> 03:06:00.480]   - And you don't come to mine.
[03:06:00.480 --> 03:06:03.640]   Ben Aspin was very sad.
[03:06:03.640 --> 03:06:05.640]   - Well, I love Ben, I love Ben.
[03:06:05.640 --> 03:06:07.960]   - Well, you should have showed it by showing up.
[03:06:07.960 --> 03:06:09.880]   - Man, I hide from the world,
[03:06:09.880 --> 03:06:12.760]   and I'm afraid of social interaction,
[03:06:12.760 --> 03:06:14.680]   and I just lay on the ground instead,
[03:06:14.680 --> 03:06:16.200]   and feel sorry for myself.
[03:06:16.200 --> 03:06:18.440]   - It's not bad Santa, it's sad Santa.
[03:06:19.800 --> 03:06:22.300]   - Well, I conserve my emotional energy
[03:06:22.300 --> 03:06:24.200]   towards this one day of the year.
[03:06:24.200 --> 03:06:25.620]   - Okay. (laughs)
[03:06:25.620 --> 03:06:28.120]   - Intensely spread my joy.
[03:06:28.120 --> 03:06:30.900]   All right, speaking of which,
[03:06:30.900 --> 03:06:33.180]   you tell a Christmas story in the book.
[03:06:33.180 --> 03:06:34.860]   - Are you spoiling that chapter?
[03:06:34.860 --> 03:06:35.980]   It's called Die Hard.
[03:06:35.980 --> 03:06:37.740]   - All right, well, I'm not gonna spoil it.
[03:06:37.740 --> 03:06:38.820]   It's really good.
[03:06:38.820 --> 03:06:40.380]   - I was very proud of that chapter.
[03:06:40.380 --> 03:06:41.220]   - Why?
[03:06:41.220 --> 03:06:43.780]   - Because the ending that's a Christmas story,
[03:06:43.780 --> 03:06:45.740]   it's just like, I know everyone reading it's gonna go
[03:06:45.740 --> 03:06:48.220]   Google it, be like, these can't be real, but it was real.
[03:06:48.220 --> 03:06:50.820]   - That it was a Christmas, yeah, sure.
[03:06:50.820 --> 03:06:53.100]   I mean, this has to do with the bigger picture.
[03:06:53.100 --> 03:06:55.820]   We don't have to do the big reveal,
[03:06:55.820 --> 03:06:58.300]   but the bigger picture of there was an iron curtain,
[03:06:58.300 --> 03:07:01.780]   and it was coming down in complex ways.
[03:07:01.780 --> 03:07:03.980]   How would you define the iron curtain?
[03:07:03.980 --> 03:07:05.460]   There's a set of ideologies,
[03:07:05.460 --> 03:07:07.580]   a set of countries united by an ideology,
[03:07:07.580 --> 03:07:10.540]   and a set of countries united by a different ideology,
[03:07:10.540 --> 03:07:15.260]   and there's a curtain that divided them,
[03:07:15.260 --> 03:07:16.740]   and it eventually came down.
[03:07:16.740 --> 03:07:18.940]   So how would you describe how it came down?
[03:07:18.940 --> 03:07:23.620]   - It came, I hate that I can never remember,
[03:07:23.620 --> 03:07:26.140]   ever, ever remember if this was Hemingway.
[03:07:26.140 --> 03:07:28.420]   No, it was Hemingway.
[03:07:28.420 --> 03:07:29.340]   - It was Mark Twain.
[03:07:29.340 --> 03:07:32.340]   - No, it came down two ways, gradually, then suddenly.
[03:07:32.340 --> 03:07:38.100]   The thing with the iron curtain and the Warsaw Pact,
[03:07:38.100 --> 03:07:42.620]   these were a bunch of nations run under communism,
[03:07:42.620 --> 03:07:47.620]   but they were all, almost all, under the sway of Moscow.
[03:07:47.620 --> 03:07:50.580]   So if they were going to make big changes,
[03:07:50.580 --> 03:07:53.740]   Moscow had to prove it.
[03:07:53.740 --> 03:07:58.740]   It was in the '50s when Hungary decided to rebel,
[03:07:58.740 --> 03:08:01.260]   or not rebel, liberalize,
[03:08:01.260 --> 03:08:05.100]   and they even were thinking of leaving the Warsaw Pact,
[03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:07.580]   and the Russians send in the tanks,
[03:08:07.580 --> 03:08:08.540]   and you had the development
[03:08:08.540 --> 03:08:10.580]   of what was called the Brezhnev Doctrine,
[03:08:10.580 --> 03:08:13.340]   which was the idea that it is the duty
[03:08:13.340 --> 03:08:15.700]   of all the Warsaw Pact nations,
[03:08:15.700 --> 03:08:17.340]   if another country tries to,
[03:08:17.340 --> 03:08:18.740]   and this was also in '68,
[03:08:18.740 --> 03:08:20.780]   in the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia,
[03:08:20.780 --> 03:08:25.100]   if a nation wants to leave socialism,
[03:08:25.100 --> 03:08:26.900]   it is incumbent on those socialist nations
[03:08:26.900 --> 03:08:28.900]   to do whatever is necessary
[03:08:28.900 --> 03:08:30.940]   to make sure there isn't a counter-revolution.
[03:08:30.940 --> 03:08:35.340]   So they were very much under Moscow's thumb.
[03:08:36.900 --> 03:08:41.900]   And one of the big ways it changed was one man,
[03:08:41.900 --> 03:08:45.140]   and that was Mikhail Gorbachev.
[03:08:45.140 --> 03:08:48.460]   And he was the first Russian leader
[03:08:48.460 --> 03:08:51.420]   to be born after the October Revolution.
[03:08:51.420 --> 03:08:54.340]   He grew up, and his grandfather was arrested
[03:08:54.340 --> 03:08:55.460]   for being a Trotskyite,
[03:08:55.460 --> 03:08:58.860]   and the other one was arrested for this or that.
[03:08:58.860 --> 03:09:01.620]   He saw his village starve as a result of Stalin.
[03:09:01.620 --> 03:09:05.860]   So even though he was a very committed communist,
[03:09:05.860 --> 03:09:10.180]   he also was very and increasingly skeptical
[03:09:10.180 --> 03:09:12.180]   of authoritarianism.
[03:09:12.180 --> 03:09:15.220]   And in Poland, for example,
[03:09:15.220 --> 03:09:16.820]   you had the Solidarity Movement,
[03:09:16.820 --> 03:09:20.300]   and this was a labor union movement,
[03:09:20.300 --> 03:09:22.060]   and the government didn't know what to do.
[03:09:22.060 --> 03:09:23.820]   They were getting a lot of support from the peoples.
[03:09:23.820 --> 03:09:26.540]   They had strikes, and the Gdansk Shipyard
[03:09:26.540 --> 03:09:28.220]   was where one of them started.
[03:09:28.220 --> 03:09:30.820]   And basically, Moscow told them,
[03:09:30.820 --> 03:09:33.740]   "Either you crack down, or we're cracking down on you."
[03:09:33.740 --> 03:09:34.660]   And they're like, "All right."
[03:09:34.660 --> 03:09:35.940]   And they declared martial law,
[03:09:35.940 --> 03:09:38.540]   and they arrested the leaders, put them away.
[03:09:38.540 --> 03:09:41.740]   But then when Gorbachev was in charge,
[03:09:41.740 --> 03:09:43.380]   there wasn't a gun to their back,
[03:09:43.380 --> 03:09:45.340]   and it was the communist leaders themselves
[03:09:45.340 --> 03:09:46.380]   who were like, "You know what?"
[03:09:46.380 --> 03:09:47.380]   There was this really funny moment
[03:09:47.380 --> 03:09:51.540]   where Lech Walesa is meeting with Margaret Thatcher,
[03:09:51.540 --> 03:09:55.660]   and he's telling her what solidarity the movement wants,
[03:09:55.660 --> 03:09:58.220]   and she had been meeting with the Polish government as well.
[03:09:58.220 --> 03:10:02.060]   And she's like, "Look, tell them what,"
[03:10:02.060 --> 03:10:03.820]   'cause they had tried,
[03:10:04.420 --> 03:10:06.060]   the government wanted her to tell them
[03:10:06.060 --> 03:10:07.700]   that we wanna negotiate and work things out.
[03:10:07.700 --> 03:10:09.060]   She goes, "All right, tell the government
[03:10:09.060 --> 03:10:10.460]   what it is that you're asking for."
[03:10:10.460 --> 03:10:11.820]   And he just points to the ceiling, and she goes,
[03:10:11.820 --> 03:10:14.740]   he's like, "Oh yeah, our meetings are bugged anyway."
[03:10:14.740 --> 03:10:17.700]   But they then had the freedom
[03:10:17.700 --> 03:10:21.940]   because they knew that Gorbachev wasn't forcing them
[03:10:21.940 --> 03:10:23.940]   to drive solidarity underground.
[03:10:23.940 --> 03:10:25.060]   So they had the idea of like,
[03:10:25.060 --> 03:10:26.580]   "Let's work together with these people."
[03:10:26.580 --> 03:10:27.980]   And as a result of this,
[03:10:27.980 --> 03:10:32.980]   Poland liberalized and freed itself fairly easily,
[03:10:33.620 --> 03:10:36.060]   and with a minimum of bloodshed in '89.
[03:10:36.060 --> 03:10:38.820]   And there was this whole argument for the Vietnam War
[03:10:38.820 --> 03:10:40.460]   with something called domino theory,
[03:10:40.460 --> 03:10:41.940]   which is if you lose Vietnam,
[03:10:41.940 --> 03:10:42.980]   then you're gonna lose Laos,
[03:10:42.980 --> 03:10:43.860]   then you lose Cambodia.
[03:10:43.860 --> 03:10:45.500]   One by one, the countries are gonna turn communist
[03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:46.580]   to the dominoes,
[03:10:46.580 --> 03:10:48.980]   but people didn't realize the reverse was true
[03:10:48.980 --> 03:10:50.700]   'cause after Poland liberalized,
[03:10:50.700 --> 03:10:52.900]   then you have Hungary,
[03:10:52.900 --> 03:10:55.020]   then you have Czechoslovakia,
[03:10:55.020 --> 03:10:57.100]   then you had East Germany,
[03:10:57.100 --> 03:10:59.020]   and the fall of the Berlin Wall.
[03:10:59.020 --> 03:11:03.340]   So it's a great thing because as this is happening,
[03:11:03.340 --> 03:11:05.780]   the people are looking around and they're like,
[03:11:05.780 --> 03:11:08.780]   "Wait, that's it?
[03:11:08.780 --> 03:11:10.260]   "This has gotta be a trick."
[03:11:10.260 --> 03:11:11.260]   And it wasn't a trick.
[03:11:11.260 --> 03:11:13.620]   So one of my favorite books,
[03:11:13.620 --> 03:11:16.100]   which was a big inspiration for this one,
[03:11:16.100 --> 03:11:17.620]   was by my favorite historian.
[03:11:17.620 --> 03:11:20.860]   I apologize to David Petruccio and Arthur Herman,
[03:11:20.860 --> 03:11:23.140]   my second and third, they're tied.
[03:11:23.140 --> 03:11:27.740]   But Victor Sebastian wrote a book called "Revolution 1989."
[03:11:27.740 --> 03:11:29.460]   And he just talked about that year
[03:11:29.460 --> 03:11:31.100]   and how all these countries,
[03:11:31.100 --> 03:11:32.620]   one after another, liberalized.
[03:11:32.620 --> 03:11:34.700]   And it's just such a,
[03:11:34.700 --> 03:11:37.180]   and none of them thought this was possible.
[03:11:37.180 --> 03:11:40.980]   One of my favorite, favorite moments in this book
[03:11:40.980 --> 03:11:44.500]   is Helmut Kohl, who was the head of West Germany,
[03:11:44.500 --> 03:11:48.420]   is in Warsaw with Lech Walesa discussing the Berlin Wall.
[03:11:48.420 --> 03:11:49.260]   And Lech Walesa's like,
[03:11:49.260 --> 03:11:50.300]   "I don't think it's gonna be around
[03:11:50.300 --> 03:11:52.580]   "for another few years."
[03:11:52.580 --> 03:11:55.940]   And Helmut Kohl laughs in his face.
[03:11:55.940 --> 03:11:58.340]   And he goes, "Look, you're young.
[03:11:58.340 --> 03:11:59.740]   "This isn't how things work.
[03:11:59.740 --> 03:12:01.980]   "This is gonna take some doing."
[03:12:01.980 --> 03:12:03.820]   It fell the next day.
[03:12:03.820 --> 03:12:06.820]   And Helmut Kohl literally says, "I'm at the wrong party."
[03:12:06.820 --> 03:12:09.260]   And he got in a plane and got out of Warsaw.
[03:12:09.260 --> 03:12:13.580]   So there are, why this book has a broader message
[03:12:13.580 --> 03:12:16.860]   than the actual stories of these incidents
[03:12:16.860 --> 03:12:20.580]   is that as these wonderful things are happening,
[03:12:20.580 --> 03:12:23.340]   the universal consensus at the time is,
[03:12:23.340 --> 03:12:24.900]   it's never gonna happen.
[03:12:24.900 --> 03:12:26.140]   Or if it does gonna happen,
[03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:28.500]   it's gonna happen only through an enormous amount
[03:12:28.500 --> 03:12:30.140]   of carnage and blood.
[03:12:30.140 --> 03:12:31.820]   And when it doesn't, then everyone's like,
[03:12:31.820 --> 03:12:33.700]   "Oh, it was inevitable."
[03:12:33.700 --> 03:12:35.220]   You didn't say it was inevitable at the time.
[03:12:35.220 --> 03:12:37.180]   You only said it was inevitable after the fact.
[03:12:37.180 --> 03:12:41.300]   And the other thing that was really brought me a lot of joy
[03:12:41.300 --> 03:12:45.220]   is there are so many moments of men with guns
[03:12:45.220 --> 03:12:47.420]   saying, "We're not shooting anyone."
[03:12:47.420 --> 03:12:50.940]   'Cause they wanted several Tiananmen Squares.
[03:12:50.940 --> 03:12:54.180]   They wanted it in East Berlin.
[03:12:54.180 --> 03:12:56.740]   They wanted it in Romania.
[03:12:56.740 --> 03:12:58.300]   They wanted it in Moscow.
[03:12:58.300 --> 03:13:02.500]   And these strong, tough, trained men with guns were like,
[03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:06.180]   "No, we're not shooting the civilians."
[03:13:06.180 --> 03:13:09.380]   And then everything else was history.
[03:13:09.380 --> 03:13:12.940]   - Yeah, just as surprising as the mass violence
[03:13:12.940 --> 03:13:17.860]   committed by police and the army on its own citizenry,
[03:13:17.860 --> 03:13:21.780]   equally surprising is when they choose not to somehow.
[03:13:21.780 --> 03:13:23.020]   - Yeah.
[03:13:23.020 --> 03:13:24.060]   - And what is that?
[03:13:24.060 --> 03:13:27.740]   How do you explain 1989?
[03:13:27.740 --> 03:13:32.740]   How do you explain this progress that happened so suddenly?
[03:13:32.740 --> 03:13:38.540]   How do you explain that at the beginning of the 20th century
[03:13:38.540 --> 03:13:43.080]   so much revolution happened that created communism?
[03:13:43.080 --> 03:13:46.900]   And how do you explain then the collapse of that
[03:13:46.900 --> 03:13:49.240]   across so many nations at the same time?
[03:13:49.240 --> 03:13:52.620]   - I think a large part of it had to do
[03:13:52.620 --> 03:13:56.020]   with the closer interconnections
[03:13:56.020 --> 03:13:57.940]   between people like Gorbachev and Thatcher
[03:13:57.940 --> 03:13:59.460]   and Gorbachev and Reagan.
[03:13:59.460 --> 03:14:01.820]   Because both of them visited Red Square.
[03:14:01.820 --> 03:14:06.060]   And in the years before, these are enemies.
[03:14:06.060 --> 03:14:07.500]   They wanna invade, they wanna kill us.
[03:14:07.500 --> 03:14:09.220]   The Americans thought this about the Russians.
[03:14:09.220 --> 03:14:10.960]   The Russians thought this about the Americans.
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:12.860]   Obviously not so much the British.
[03:14:12.860 --> 03:14:17.260]   And they got on really well.
[03:14:17.260 --> 03:14:19.060]   When Gorbachev came to Chequers,
[03:14:19.060 --> 03:14:23.020]   which is the prime minister's countryside estate,
[03:14:23.020 --> 03:14:25.280]   Thatcher sat him down and she's lecturing him
[03:14:25.280 --> 03:14:27.740]   about human rights and she's lecturing him about economics
[03:14:27.740 --> 03:14:29.100]   and she's lecturing him about this and that.
[03:14:29.100 --> 03:14:31.220]   And then she's lecturing him about why he's in a meeting
[03:14:31.220 --> 03:14:32.380]   while he's yelling at her.
[03:14:32.380 --> 03:14:34.980]   And he goes, "Mrs. Thatcher,
[03:14:34.980 --> 03:14:38.900]   I know you have a lot of strong opinions.
[03:14:38.900 --> 03:14:39.980]   I do too.
[03:14:39.980 --> 03:14:41.580]   I haven't been sent here to recruit you
[03:14:41.580 --> 03:14:42.500]   to the Communist Party."
[03:14:42.500 --> 03:14:44.100]   And she just started laughing.
[03:14:44.100 --> 03:14:49.020]   But right away, there was such a sense in the air
[03:14:49.020 --> 03:14:50.600]   of we can do better.
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:52.460]   We're spending all this money on missiles.
[03:14:52.460 --> 03:14:54.560]   We're spending all this money on the military.
[03:14:54.560 --> 03:14:55.820]   It's expensive.
[03:14:55.820 --> 03:14:57.580]   And for what?
[03:14:57.580 --> 03:15:00.260]   We don't have to be looking at each other as enemies.
[03:15:00.260 --> 03:15:02.620]   We can try to work together to kind of,
[03:15:02.620 --> 03:15:07.540]   at the very least, lower the volume and the heat.
[03:15:07.540 --> 03:15:09.700]   - How much credit do you give to Gorbachev the man?
[03:15:09.700 --> 03:15:12.940]   So meaning, how much power does a single individual have?
[03:15:12.940 --> 03:15:15.580]   - I could not give him more credit.
[03:15:15.580 --> 03:15:17.420]   I had a tweet last year where I said,
[03:15:17.420 --> 03:15:19.460]   "Who do you think is the greatest person alive right now?"
[03:15:19.460 --> 03:15:21.220]   And my answer by far would be Gorbachev.
[03:15:21.220 --> 03:15:22.040]   Then he died.
[03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:23.340]   I don't know who it is right now.
[03:15:23.340 --> 03:15:26.320]   - It's just funny because Gorbachev also had a tweet.
[03:15:26.320 --> 03:15:28.580]   (laughing)
[03:15:28.580 --> 03:15:31.060]   - But it was my big pic.
[03:15:31.060 --> 03:15:33.560]   - And he said, oh sure.
[03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:38.860]   That would be a good, now I wish I interviewed Gorbachev
[03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:40.940]   and asked him the famous question
[03:15:40.940 --> 03:15:44.580]   of what would you like best about Michael Malice.
[03:15:44.580 --> 03:15:46.980]   - Look, the transition after the Soviet Union fell
[03:15:46.980 --> 03:15:50.760]   to Russia and Yeltsin was not a smooth one by any means.
[03:15:50.760 --> 03:15:52.820]   As I say at the end of the book,
[03:15:52.820 --> 03:15:55.300]   it's not like they lived happily ever after.
[03:15:55.300 --> 03:15:57.700]   But my broader point is you take the wins
[03:15:57.700 --> 03:15:59.180]   when you can get them.
[03:15:59.180 --> 03:16:01.180]   People now had access to passports.
[03:16:01.180 --> 03:16:03.840]   They don't have to have, they can leave the country.
[03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:04.860]   They have food.
[03:16:04.860 --> 03:16:06.120]   They have access to information.
[03:16:06.120 --> 03:16:08.020]   It's somewhat censored, but it's certainly nothing
[03:16:08.020 --> 03:16:11.220]   like it was under the Soviet Union.
[03:16:11.220 --> 03:16:15.580]   And they didn't have to live in this kind of constant fear.
[03:16:15.580 --> 03:16:18.380]   And they had opportunities and it's such a step forward.
[03:16:18.380 --> 03:16:21.220]   And there was this one great moment,
[03:16:21.220 --> 03:16:25.820]   and Boris Yeltsin became president of Russia.
[03:16:25.820 --> 03:16:27.700]   He's also mayor of Moscow at one point
[03:16:27.700 --> 03:16:29.580]   or the equivalent of mayor.
[03:16:29.580 --> 03:16:31.820]   And he came here to visit NASA
[03:16:31.820 --> 03:16:34.100]   in the capacity of one or the other.
[03:16:34.100 --> 03:16:36.500]   And while he was there, he went to visit a supermarket.
[03:16:36.500 --> 03:16:38.860]   It was a Randalls then, I think it's a food town now.
[03:16:38.860 --> 03:16:39.720]   It still exists.
[03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:40.560]   I'm gonna go there.
[03:16:40.560 --> 03:16:42.780]   I'm gonna start bawling.
[03:16:42.780 --> 03:16:44.900]   And as he's looking around,
[03:16:44.900 --> 03:16:47.660]   he had never seen so much food.
[03:16:47.660 --> 03:16:49.540]   And this is food that even wealthy people
[03:16:49.540 --> 03:16:51.060]   in Russia don't have access to.
[03:16:51.060 --> 03:16:53.900]   And there's pictures of him just like this, like what?
[03:16:53.900 --> 03:16:58.020]   And the scene that really was poignant to me
[03:16:58.020 --> 03:16:59.620]   is on his flight back,
[03:16:59.620 --> 03:17:02.460]   he's sitting there on the plane like this.
[03:17:02.460 --> 03:17:06.660]   And he's like, they had to lie to the people
[03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:08.180]   because if they knew,
[03:17:08.180 --> 03:17:10.340]   they wouldn't have been able to get away with it.
[03:17:10.340 --> 03:17:12.020]   And that's the moment where it's just like,
[03:17:12.020 --> 03:17:15.340]   oh, this wasn't like skewed propaganda.
[03:17:15.340 --> 03:17:20.100]   This was like, they knew and it was a lie from A to Z.
[03:17:20.100 --> 03:17:22.540]   And he was just like, holy crap.
[03:17:22.540 --> 03:17:24.260]   And you can just imagine him on that plane,
[03:17:24.260 --> 03:17:25.900]   his brain reprogramming.
[03:17:25.900 --> 03:17:27.540]   Because if you're taught since you're a kid,
[03:17:27.540 --> 03:17:29.540]   and he was an older man, he was no dummy.
[03:17:29.540 --> 03:17:31.980]   You think, okay, the Americans are starving and poor
[03:17:31.980 --> 03:17:33.900]   and they're lynching people every day.
[03:17:33.900 --> 03:17:36.140]   And then you go to a supermarket,
[03:17:36.140 --> 03:17:38.620]   the most banal place on earth.
[03:17:38.620 --> 03:17:41.260]   And you see, I think one of the articles said
[03:17:41.260 --> 03:17:42.820]   they couldn't believe how big the onions were
[03:17:42.820 --> 03:17:43.660]   or something like that.
[03:17:43.660 --> 03:17:44.500]   And you're seeing this
[03:17:44.500 --> 03:17:46.940]   and you're seeing these janitors, school teachers,
[03:17:46.940 --> 03:17:48.180]   these aren't dignitaries.
[03:17:48.180 --> 03:17:49.180]   And they're regular people
[03:17:49.180 --> 03:17:50.300]   just picking whatever they want.
[03:17:50.300 --> 03:17:53.980]   And you're just like, it's like the equivalent
[03:17:53.980 --> 03:17:54.980]   of having a stroke.
[03:17:54.980 --> 03:17:58.260]   - I do think that that's one of the most powerful things
[03:17:58.260 --> 03:18:00.340]   is the grocery store.
[03:18:00.340 --> 03:18:04.900]   In terms of drawing a distinction between the two systems.
[03:18:04.900 --> 03:18:05.820]   - Yeah.
[03:18:05.820 --> 03:18:09.860]   - 'Cause you can show off technology and so on,
[03:18:09.860 --> 03:18:12.140]   but you can kind of sign right off technology
[03:18:12.140 --> 03:18:16.060]   as like, okay, that's the mechanism of the devil.
[03:18:16.060 --> 03:18:21.060]   But when you look at just fruit and veggies
[03:18:21.060 --> 03:18:24.980]   and like very big fruit and veggies and like,
[03:18:24.980 --> 03:18:26.880]   yeah, and fruit in particular,
[03:18:26.880 --> 03:18:27.860]   like certain kinds of fruit
[03:18:27.860 --> 03:18:30.020]   that are just not available in Russia.
[03:18:30.020 --> 03:18:33.900]   I mean, yeah, that really shows, wait a minute.
[03:18:33.900 --> 03:18:34.740]   - Yeah.
[03:18:34.740 --> 03:18:39.580]   - It's interesting, like when you're older
[03:18:39.580 --> 03:18:43.140]   and you have to face the reality
[03:18:43.140 --> 03:18:45.660]   that what you believe to be true,
[03:18:45.660 --> 03:18:48.700]   that your whole life has been based on a set of lies.
[03:18:48.700 --> 03:18:51.020]   - And you're right, not mistakes,
[03:18:51.020 --> 03:18:54.220]   not like a little bit like blatant lies
[03:18:54.220 --> 03:18:57.100]   from top to bottom, start to finish.
[03:18:57.100 --> 03:18:59.140]   I don't know what that's like.
[03:18:59.140 --> 03:19:01.900]   - How much, you start the book,
[03:19:01.900 --> 03:19:03.900]   I think you start the book with Ayn Rand.
[03:19:03.900 --> 03:19:04.740]   Yes. - Yes.
[03:19:04.740 --> 03:19:05.580]   - Yes.
[03:19:05.580 --> 03:19:08.380]   As one does.
[03:19:08.380 --> 03:19:12.220]   So before the revolution, she was born in Russia
[03:19:12.220 --> 03:19:13.780]   and she witnessed the revolution
[03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:17.900]   and moved to the United States in the 20--
[03:19:17.900 --> 03:19:20.220]   - 26, 1926. - 1926.
[03:19:20.220 --> 03:19:22.260]   I remember like it was yesterday.
[03:19:22.260 --> 03:19:25.900]   Anyway, you're right that she spent a lot of her life
[03:19:25.900 --> 03:19:27.640]   trying to convince Americans in the world
[03:19:27.640 --> 03:19:32.640]   that the negative effects of totalitarian government,
[03:19:32.640 --> 03:19:35.420]   just maybe using her as an example,
[03:19:35.420 --> 03:19:37.620]   but also this question,
[03:19:37.620 --> 03:19:38.740]   can we draw a distinction
[03:19:38.740 --> 03:19:42.460]   between authoritarian regimes and communism?
[03:19:42.460 --> 03:19:44.180]   Is it possible to still man the case
[03:19:44.180 --> 03:19:47.860]   that not all implementations of socialism and communism
[03:19:47.860 --> 03:19:50.860]   would lead to the atrocities we've seen in the Soviet Union
[03:19:50.860 --> 03:19:52.860]   and in China under Mao?
[03:19:52.860 --> 03:19:55.900]   Like when you, in studying all of this,
[03:19:55.900 --> 03:19:59.620]   how much blame do you put on the ideologies,
[03:19:59.620 --> 03:20:01.420]   on the Marxist ideologies
[03:20:01.420 --> 03:20:04.000]   versus the particular leaders and dictators?
[03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:06.340]   - Well, you have to blame the leaders a lot
[03:20:06.340 --> 03:20:07.900]   because they had different leaders
[03:20:07.900 --> 03:20:11.020]   in different countries were different from each other.
[03:20:11.020 --> 03:20:13.900]   Ducek, who took over Czechoslovakia
[03:20:13.900 --> 03:20:16.820]   and he tried to introduce socialism with a human face
[03:20:16.820 --> 03:20:18.620]   in the Prague Spring of 1968,
[03:20:18.620 --> 03:20:19.740]   he was like, all right,
[03:20:19.740 --> 03:20:21.820]   we got to do away with this authoritarianism.
[03:20:21.820 --> 03:20:23.460]   We got to have more free speech.
[03:20:23.460 --> 03:20:25.660]   He was thinking of introducing elements of democracy.
[03:20:25.660 --> 03:20:27.700]   Now then the Russians sent in the tanks,
[03:20:27.700 --> 03:20:30.900]   but the point is he certainly was someone who was like,
[03:20:30.900 --> 03:20:32.540]   all right, this has got to stop.
[03:20:32.540 --> 03:20:34.180]   This is just absolutely crazy.
[03:20:34.180 --> 03:20:39.620]   Khrushchev and Stalin were not the same animal at all.
[03:20:40.580 --> 03:20:45.580]   So I think the problem with communism in the Marxist sense
[03:20:45.580 --> 03:20:48.860]   is that you're going to have an introduce
[03:20:48.860 --> 03:20:50.220]   an element of authoritarianism
[03:20:50.220 --> 03:20:53.820]   simply because you can't have economic planning.
[03:20:53.820 --> 03:20:55.620]   If I don't have a price mechanism,
[03:20:55.620 --> 03:20:59.420]   I don't know how price is what is me knowing
[03:20:59.420 --> 03:21:01.660]   as a consumer or a producer,
[03:21:01.660 --> 03:21:04.180]   what should be produced or what there's a shortage of.
[03:21:04.180 --> 03:21:06.200]   As prices increase, that's a signal
[03:21:06.200 --> 03:21:07.180]   that we have a shortage here.
[03:21:07.180 --> 03:21:09.580]   As prices decrease, that means that there's a surplus here.
[03:21:09.580 --> 03:21:10.900]   But if I'm setting the price,
[03:21:10.900 --> 03:21:14.300]   I don't really know how much weed I need to produce
[03:21:14.300 --> 03:21:16.180]   if I'm compared to corn, as compared to shoes,
[03:21:16.180 --> 03:21:17.780]   as compared to Santa costumes.
[03:21:17.780 --> 03:21:20.140]   So that is a big problem.
[03:21:20.140 --> 03:21:25.140]   The other issue is if you have one agency, the government,
[03:21:25.140 --> 03:21:28.860]   having a monopoly on let's suppose the news,
[03:21:28.860 --> 03:21:30.660]   like you were talking about earlier with Twitter,
[03:21:30.660 --> 03:21:32.020]   it's going to be really hard
[03:21:32.020 --> 03:21:34.980]   to have any kind of objective discourse
[03:21:34.980 --> 03:21:37.500]   because everyone is going to be working
[03:21:37.500 --> 03:21:39.260]   for the same organization.
[03:21:39.260 --> 03:21:40.580]   That is going to cause a problem
[03:21:40.580 --> 03:21:42.340]   in terms of having a feedback mechanism,
[03:21:42.340 --> 03:21:43.900]   even in the best scenario,
[03:21:43.900 --> 03:21:47.260]   in terms of this is a problem, this isn't a problem.
[03:21:47.260 --> 03:21:50.820]   And when you have a monopoly, which is what a government is,
[03:21:50.820 --> 03:21:52.340]   I think people are very familiar
[03:21:52.340 --> 03:21:54.220]   with what the problems happen with monopoly.
[03:21:54.220 --> 03:21:55.940]   There's lack of accountability.
[03:21:55.940 --> 03:21:58.340]   Bureaucracies are faceless and then no one's to blame,
[03:21:58.340 --> 03:22:01.860]   but yet everyone kind of suffers as a consequence.
[03:22:01.860 --> 03:22:04.660]   So it doesn't necessarily have to be
[03:22:04.660 --> 03:22:07.380]   as authoritarian as Stalinism,
[03:22:07.380 --> 03:22:11.020]   but you can't have a government,
[03:22:11.020 --> 03:22:12.980]   which is authority by its nature,
[03:22:12.980 --> 03:22:17.980]   be this pervasive without a strong amount of oppression.
[03:22:17.980 --> 03:22:20.700]   Same thing with even if you just have like,
[03:22:20.700 --> 03:22:22.420]   let's say socialized healthcare,
[03:22:22.420 --> 03:22:23.700]   you're going to have to make it illegal
[03:22:23.700 --> 03:22:25.780]   for doctors to practice privately.
[03:22:25.780 --> 03:22:27.260]   You're going to have to have rationing,
[03:22:27.260 --> 03:22:28.100]   so on and so forth.
[03:22:28.100 --> 03:22:30.620]   Now that might be a price that people are willing to pay
[03:22:30.620 --> 03:22:33.420]   because you can't have infinite spending on healthcare.
[03:22:33.420 --> 03:22:35.900]   So something's going to have to give somewhere.
[03:22:35.900 --> 03:22:38.180]   So there is an element of authoritarianism there
[03:22:38.180 --> 03:22:39.340]   and people are comfortable with that
[03:22:39.340 --> 03:22:41.060]   and I can wrap my head around it.
[03:22:41.060 --> 03:22:43.980]   But if you're going to have one organization
[03:22:43.980 --> 03:22:46.340]   running literally everything in society,
[03:22:46.340 --> 03:22:47.900]   I don't see how you do that
[03:22:47.900 --> 03:22:51.620]   and have any measure of liberalism.
[03:22:51.620 --> 03:22:54.020]   - Why do you think Ayn Rand had so much trouble
[03:22:54.020 --> 03:23:00.860]   telling people the danger of Soviet Stalinism?
[03:23:04.460 --> 03:23:08.740]   - Well, I think a more pertinent question
[03:23:08.740 --> 03:23:10.940]   is why did Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman
[03:23:10.940 --> 03:23:12.180]   have so much problems?
[03:23:12.180 --> 03:23:13.940]   So they were hardcore--
[03:23:13.940 --> 03:23:14.940]   - These are anarchists.
[03:23:14.940 --> 03:23:16.740]   - Yeah, they're Emma Goldman's on the cover.
[03:23:16.740 --> 03:23:20.420]   They were deported from the US.
[03:23:20.420 --> 03:23:22.400]   J. Edgar Hoover saw them off at Ellis Island.
[03:23:22.400 --> 03:23:24.320]   They were sent to Russia.
[03:23:24.320 --> 03:23:27.260]   They were bloodthirsty revolutionaries.
[03:23:27.260 --> 03:23:30.500]   They had no shortage advocating violence when necessary.
[03:23:30.500 --> 03:23:31.740]   And when they went there,
[03:23:31.740 --> 03:23:33.420]   they were just like, this is a complete nightmare.
[03:23:33.420 --> 03:23:35.500]   They both individually had meetings with Lenin
[03:23:35.500 --> 03:23:37.460]   complaining about political prisoners,
[03:23:37.460 --> 03:23:38.740]   complaining about lack of free speech.
[03:23:38.740 --> 03:23:41.140]   He told them, this is a revolutionary time.
[03:23:41.140 --> 03:23:42.540]   You could do that later.
[03:23:42.540 --> 03:23:44.180]   And when they both left,
[03:23:44.180 --> 03:23:47.020]   she wrote her memoir was split into two books,
[03:23:47.020 --> 03:23:48.220]   "My Disillusionment in Russia"
[03:23:48.220 --> 03:23:50.020]   and "My Third Disillusionment in Russia."
[03:23:50.020 --> 03:23:52.220]   He wrote "The Bolshevik Myth"
[03:23:52.220 --> 03:23:54.980]   and she was in England and she gave a speech
[03:23:54.980 --> 03:23:55.820]   and she's just like,
[03:23:55.820 --> 03:23:57.660]   if you guys think this is for the workers,
[03:23:57.660 --> 03:23:59.140]   this is the biggest lie I've ever heard.
[03:23:59.140 --> 03:24:00.900]   Like they're oppressing the workers
[03:24:00.900 --> 03:24:03.180]   like no capitalist has ever imagined.
[03:24:03.180 --> 03:24:05.060]   And as she described it,
[03:24:05.060 --> 03:24:07.180]   like people were just shifting their seats,
[03:24:07.180 --> 03:24:08.340]   they were interrupting her.
[03:24:08.340 --> 03:24:09.780]   And when she opened her talk,
[03:24:09.780 --> 03:24:11.180]   she had a standing ovation.
[03:24:11.180 --> 03:24:13.140]   And when she was done, you could hear a pin drop.
[03:24:13.140 --> 03:24:14.380]   So they didn't wanna hear it
[03:24:14.380 --> 03:24:16.980]   because this was this kind of,
[03:24:16.980 --> 03:24:18.540]   and Eugene Lyons talks about it later.
[03:24:18.540 --> 03:24:21.460]   This was like the guinea pig theory of the Russian people.
[03:24:21.460 --> 03:24:24.840]   Like we're gonna experiment on them over there.
[03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:26.380]   If it works, great, we're right.
[03:24:26.380 --> 03:24:27.740]   If it's wrong, it's their problem.
[03:24:27.740 --> 03:24:30.340]   And sure, these animals squeal, but they're beneath us.
[03:24:30.340 --> 03:24:31.580]   And of course they're gonna make some noise,
[03:24:31.580 --> 03:24:33.980]   but this is a noble experiment,
[03:24:33.980 --> 03:24:37.260]   but they're experimenting on a country, several countries.
[03:24:37.260 --> 03:24:40.020]   So I think an ideology like this,
[03:24:40.020 --> 03:24:42.420]   which appeals to intellectuals,
[03:24:42.420 --> 03:24:45.260]   because if it works or if it's implemented,
[03:24:45.260 --> 03:24:48.860]   they're the ones who are gods in effect in a society,
[03:24:48.860 --> 03:24:50.820]   like their status cannot be higher.
[03:24:50.820 --> 03:24:52.420]   They really want this to work.
[03:24:52.420 --> 03:24:56.660]   Like they want a society where they are the new aristocracy,
[03:24:56.660 --> 03:24:58.540]   the most important people.
[03:24:58.540 --> 03:25:00.340]   And their criticisms of America,
[03:25:00.340 --> 03:25:02.180]   if they had a binary worldview,
[03:25:02.180 --> 03:25:04.380]   if America's bad and this is the opposite of America,
[03:25:04.380 --> 03:25:05.860]   then by definition, it's good.
[03:25:05.860 --> 03:25:08.740]   And the other binary that they bought into
[03:25:08.740 --> 03:25:12.540]   is the Nazis and the fascists hate the communists.
[03:25:12.540 --> 03:25:15.980]   And the communists, it's true, up to a point,
[03:25:15.980 --> 03:25:18.100]   hated the fascists and the Nazis.
[03:25:18.100 --> 03:25:20.540]   Okay, well, Hitler is evil.
[03:25:20.540 --> 03:25:22.820]   So this guy's against Hitler, we're with him.
[03:25:22.820 --> 03:25:25.500]   So that's an argument that's still made
[03:25:25.500 --> 03:25:27.780]   in schools growing up.
[03:25:27.780 --> 03:25:28.900]   When you talk about World War II,
[03:25:28.900 --> 03:25:30.460]   where they're like, we team up with Stalin,
[03:25:30.460 --> 03:25:32.660]   and they don't really talk about Stalin being a bad guy,
[03:25:32.660 --> 03:25:34.660]   but it's like, we worked with him to fight Hitler
[03:25:34.660 --> 03:25:36.060]   'cause Hitler was a unique evil.
[03:25:36.060 --> 03:25:38.800]   Now that is certainly true that Hitler's a unique evil,
[03:25:38.800 --> 03:25:40.740]   but that doesn't mean or even imply
[03:25:40.740 --> 03:25:43.960]   that Stalin is somehow an angel or a saint.
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:46.460]   - Do you think some of the lessons of history
[03:25:46.460 --> 03:25:51.460]   are forgotten here in our modern political discourse
[03:25:51.460 --> 03:25:52.980]   that are important to remember?
[03:25:52.980 --> 03:25:55.860]   - I was so triggered 'cause I was in the supermarket
[03:25:55.860 --> 03:25:58.580]   and there was like a company that's selling Russian ice cream
[03:25:58.580 --> 03:26:01.380]   'cause it meets these high level Soviet standards.
[03:26:01.380 --> 03:26:04.380]   And I'm just like, you think this is some kind of joke?
[03:26:04.380 --> 03:26:06.700]   You think this is some kind of kitschy punchline
[03:26:06.700 --> 03:26:10.060]   that you had decades of people who were taught in school
[03:26:10.060 --> 03:26:11.860]   to turn their parents into the police
[03:26:11.860 --> 03:26:13.220]   if they were hoarding grain,
[03:26:13.220 --> 03:26:15.040]   even if it cost them their own lives,
[03:26:15.040 --> 03:26:17.280]   where it was a crime to be married to someone
[03:26:17.280 --> 03:26:18.660]   who was an enemy of the state,
[03:26:18.660 --> 03:26:20.780]   where you had torture being the norm,
[03:26:20.780 --> 03:26:22.860]   where people were institutionalized
[03:26:22.860 --> 03:26:24.980]   because they were politically disadvantageous
[03:26:24.980 --> 03:26:26.740]   and they were called insane.
[03:26:26.740 --> 03:26:29.420]   Like this isn't just like, oh, this hammer and sickles,
[03:26:29.420 --> 03:26:31.020]   this cool, wacky symbol.
[03:26:31.020 --> 03:26:33.860]   Like the amount of blood under this symbol
[03:26:33.860 --> 03:26:34.940]   was just enormous.
[03:26:34.940 --> 03:26:37.980]   And so yeah, I think the lesson has very much been forgotten.
[03:26:37.980 --> 03:26:39.700]   - How did the ice cream taste?
[03:26:39.700 --> 03:26:40.540]   - It was fine.
[03:26:40.540 --> 03:26:44.260]   I'm a Baskin-Robbins guy, to be honest,
[03:26:44.260 --> 03:26:46.220]   but Van Leeuwen's does some great work.
[03:26:46.220 --> 03:26:49.500]   - Baskin-Robbins doesn't have any Soviet flavors?
[03:26:49.500 --> 03:26:50.340]   - No.
[03:26:54.900 --> 03:26:59.220]   - Those are dark jokes, dark jokes.
[03:26:59.220 --> 03:27:02.040]   I'm gonna self-publish a book of jokes.
[03:27:02.040 --> 03:27:10.300]   Coming out in a grocery store near you.
[03:27:10.300 --> 03:27:15.180]   Okay, what was the hardest part about writing this book?
[03:27:15.180 --> 03:27:16.860]   Spent two years writing it.
[03:27:16.860 --> 03:27:20.220]   - So when I write books for celebrities
[03:27:20.220 --> 03:27:21.340]   and I was co-authoring them,
[03:27:21.340 --> 03:27:23.380]   I did it kind of like method acting.
[03:27:23.380 --> 03:27:25.620]   I tried to get into their head as much as possible
[03:27:25.620 --> 03:27:28.180]   to kind of speak in their voice.
[03:27:28.180 --> 03:27:33.180]   And when you're dealing with children being tortured,
[03:27:33.180 --> 03:27:39.060]   harmed, starved, and you're trying to empathize
[03:27:39.060 --> 03:27:44.060]   with the characters, it's hard to take.
[03:27:44.060 --> 03:27:47.340]   The other big part I had, like I was saying earlier,
[03:27:47.340 --> 03:27:49.820]   is just I was just very, very concerned
[03:27:49.820 --> 03:27:53.900]   that I told this story and that it did it justice
[03:27:53.900 --> 03:27:56.140]   'cause I think this is something that is,
[03:27:56.140 --> 03:28:00.020]   I still don't understand and I'm kind of angry about it
[03:28:00.020 --> 03:28:03.400]   that it's fallen on me to tell this story.
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:07.260]   This isn't some minor incident that happens
[03:28:07.260 --> 03:28:09.940]   in some random town in pick a state.
[03:28:09.940 --> 03:28:14.700]   This is half the world for 70, 80 years.
[03:28:14.700 --> 03:28:17.460]   And the fact that it's, this is the '80s.
[03:28:17.460 --> 03:28:20.020]   I mean, you and I are old enough to remember the '80s.
[03:28:20.020 --> 03:28:22.220]   There's a show, I remember the '80s.
[03:28:22.220 --> 03:28:24.900]   The fact that all these things have just kind of,
[03:28:24.900 --> 03:28:26.680]   we have this collective amnesia.
[03:28:26.680 --> 03:28:29.620]   And even amnesia, I think a lot of this stuff,
[03:28:29.620 --> 03:28:31.720]   even I was not known even at the time
[03:28:31.720 --> 03:28:33.080]   or it was kind of obscured.
[03:28:33.080 --> 03:28:37.580]   This is, I remember I was at The Blaze,
[03:28:37.580 --> 03:28:39.460]   which is a network run by Glenn Beck
[03:28:39.460 --> 03:28:42.740]   and they're conservatives and I have a lot of fun there.
[03:28:42.740 --> 03:28:46.940]   And I'm just sitting there and sometimes they veer off.
[03:28:46.940 --> 03:28:48.540]   They're like, oh, Biden's a communist.
[03:28:48.540 --> 03:28:50.460]   I'm like, okay, Biden's a communist.
[03:28:50.460 --> 03:28:54.660]   But I'm like, we talk so much about slavery
[03:28:54.660 --> 03:28:55.940]   and the Civil War, the atrocities.
[03:28:55.940 --> 03:28:57.940]   We talk about World War II and the Holocaust.
[03:28:57.940 --> 03:29:00.380]   I'm like, how is no one talking about this?
[03:29:00.380 --> 03:29:02.380]   And this was, can very easily be portrayed
[03:29:02.380 --> 03:29:04.340]   as like conservatism's big victory
[03:29:04.340 --> 03:29:06.260]   'cause Reagan and Thatcher were so instrumental
[03:29:06.260 --> 03:29:08.820]   in guiding this to a safe landing.
[03:29:08.820 --> 03:29:11.420]   And I'm like, how is no one telling the story?
[03:29:11.420 --> 03:29:12.580]   And then one day my brain is like,
[03:29:12.580 --> 03:29:15.700]   you know, you write books for a living.
[03:29:15.700 --> 03:29:17.220]   This is kind of your job.
[03:29:17.220 --> 03:29:18.980]   And I'm like, all right, but I still don't,
[03:29:18.980 --> 03:29:22.860]   I still, I gotta tell you, I'm kind of confused
[03:29:22.860 --> 03:29:26.340]   that I'm the one who has to do this
[03:29:26.340 --> 03:29:29.620]   because this should be, you know,
[03:29:29.620 --> 03:29:31.380]   this should be 30 books like this.
[03:29:31.380 --> 03:29:33.380]   And this is a model to follow.
[03:29:33.380 --> 03:29:37.380]   - Yeah, and it's also that it's such recent history.
[03:29:37.380 --> 03:29:38.220]   - Yeah.
[03:29:38.220 --> 03:29:41.340]   - But it also kind of makes you realize
[03:29:41.340 --> 03:29:44.940]   that there might be other fights
[03:29:45.940 --> 03:29:49.220]   for progress going on right now.
[03:29:49.220 --> 03:29:50.060]   - Oh, yes.
[03:29:50.060 --> 03:29:50.900]   - In the world that we don't know about.
[03:29:50.900 --> 03:29:52.740]   So you wrote about North Korea.
[03:29:52.740 --> 03:29:54.180]   I don't know to what degree there's,
[03:29:54.180 --> 03:29:58.060]   could possibly be fights there for progress,
[03:29:58.060 --> 03:30:02.380]   but there could be, they could be boiling up.
[03:30:02.380 --> 03:30:06.580]   In China, there could be boiling up battles for progress.
[03:30:06.580 --> 03:30:10.240]   In other parts of the world, Russia, there could be.
[03:30:10.240 --> 03:30:12.420]   - And in America.
[03:30:12.420 --> 03:30:13.500]   - And in America.
[03:30:13.500 --> 03:30:16.140]   And these are all different kind of battles for progress.
[03:30:16.140 --> 03:30:20.060]   And they're all, sometimes,
[03:30:20.060 --> 03:30:23.440]   sometimes I, you know,
[03:30:23.440 --> 03:30:28.060]   we sometimes tend to criticize these battles for progress.
[03:30:28.060 --> 03:30:30.100]   Like if it's on the left,
[03:30:30.100 --> 03:30:33.100]   we'll call it like wokeism or whatever.
[03:30:33.100 --> 03:30:36.220]   And we pick extreme elements of it
[03:30:36.220 --> 03:30:39.140]   and show how silly and ridiculous it is,
[03:30:39.140 --> 03:30:41.340]   not realizing it, not acknowledging
[03:30:41.340 --> 03:30:45.700]   that there's a more civil battle going on underneath
[03:30:45.700 --> 03:30:50.700]   for actual, for respecting human dignity
[03:30:50.700 --> 03:30:54.420]   from all, for people from all walks of life.
[03:30:54.420 --> 03:30:57.180]   And the same, we tend to call anybody
[03:30:57.180 --> 03:30:59.140]   who questions mainstream narratives,
[03:30:59.140 --> 03:31:01.700]   conspiracy theorists, we dismiss them immediately.
[03:31:01.700 --> 03:31:03.860]   And they're ultimately fighting for progress.
[03:31:03.860 --> 03:31:06.420]   So people who criticize Falchi and everybody else,
[03:31:06.420 --> 03:31:07.980]   I don't know if they're,
[03:31:07.980 --> 03:31:12.980]   I think they want institutions that serve the public.
[03:31:12.980 --> 03:31:15.580]   They're fighting for progress too.
[03:31:15.580 --> 03:31:17.100]   And we tend to dismiss them.
[03:31:17.100 --> 03:31:19.980]   Like each side tends to caricature the other.
[03:31:19.980 --> 03:31:21.780]   But the battle for progress is happening.
[03:31:21.780 --> 03:31:23.500]   And I guess that's what you're,
[03:31:23.500 --> 03:31:27.340]   that's the hopeful message with the white pill, right?
[03:31:27.340 --> 03:31:29.900]   Is that there's progress being made.
[03:31:29.900 --> 03:31:32.300]   Somehow we're all making progress here.
[03:31:32.300 --> 03:31:35.640]   - I think more the hopeful message is that
[03:31:35.640 --> 03:31:38.740]   it's not possible that we have to lose.
[03:31:38.740 --> 03:31:41.860]   Like if someone tells you the straight face, you can't win,
[03:31:41.860 --> 03:31:43.940]   the enemy is too impressive and strong.
[03:31:43.940 --> 03:31:46.340]   I'm like, what are you talking about?
[03:31:46.340 --> 03:31:49.540]   I mean, look, this was the Soviet Union
[03:31:49.540 --> 03:31:53.540]   and it happened relatively quickly
[03:31:53.540 --> 03:31:56.420]   and relatively peacefully.
[03:31:56.420 --> 03:31:59.020]   I mean, again, and it wasn't because
[03:31:59.020 --> 03:32:00.660]   Honecker in East Germany was like,
[03:32:00.660 --> 03:32:03.100]   oh, I'm just gonna vacate my seat.
[03:32:03.100 --> 03:32:04.980]   He was like sending the tanks
[03:32:04.980 --> 03:32:07.340]   and the military guy said, no.
[03:32:07.340 --> 03:32:08.860]   So they wanted blood.
[03:32:08.860 --> 03:32:10.580]   There were plenty of people who wanted blood
[03:32:10.580 --> 03:32:12.300]   and would have been happy to have it.
[03:32:12.300 --> 03:32:17.300]   - So to you, maybe if not the fall of the Soviet Union,
[03:32:17.300 --> 03:32:20.580]   then the fall of the Iron Curtain
[03:32:20.580 --> 03:32:25.980]   is a great leap of progress in the 20th century.
[03:32:25.980 --> 03:32:28.820]   - I don't see how anyone can argue against that point
[03:32:28.820 --> 03:32:30.540]   with a straight face.
[03:32:30.540 --> 03:32:32.580]   - So that gives you hope that we,
[03:32:32.580 --> 03:32:34.780]   humanity were able to do that.
[03:32:34.780 --> 03:32:37.940]   - Yes, and at the same time,
[03:32:37.940 --> 03:32:42.460]   we were told at the time, give it up, be realistic.
[03:32:42.460 --> 03:32:45.580]   It's utopian to think this is going anywhere,
[03:32:45.580 --> 03:32:46.980]   maybe in a hundred years.
[03:32:46.980 --> 03:32:49.500]   Look, there's a reason Chekhov was on Star Trek
[03:32:49.500 --> 03:32:51.540]   because the idea is even the far future,
[03:32:51.540 --> 03:32:52.620]   you're gonna have America
[03:32:52.620 --> 03:32:54.060]   and you're gonna have the Soviet Union.
[03:32:54.060 --> 03:32:55.500]   Like this is the reality.
[03:32:55.500 --> 03:32:57.180]   It was called real politic.
[03:32:57.180 --> 03:32:58.180]   We're gonna have detente
[03:32:58.180 --> 03:33:00.340]   'cause it's this permanent stalemate.
[03:33:00.340 --> 03:33:02.900]   We had the Vietnam War, we got our asses kicked.
[03:33:02.900 --> 03:33:04.220]   Russia's not going anywhere.
[03:33:04.220 --> 03:33:05.700]   America's not going anywhere.
[03:33:05.700 --> 03:33:08.020]   We gotta learn to live with each other, blah, blah, blah.
[03:33:08.020 --> 03:33:09.300]   And Reagan said,
[03:33:09.300 --> 03:33:12.900]   you don't wanna hear my strategy for the Cold War?
[03:33:12.900 --> 03:33:15.420]   Some people might say it's simple or even simplistic.
[03:33:15.420 --> 03:33:16.300]   Here it is.
[03:33:16.300 --> 03:33:17.380]   We win, they lose.
[03:33:17.380 --> 03:33:21.740]   And the people who won were the Russian people
[03:33:21.740 --> 03:33:24.060]   and the Ukrainian people and the Lithuanian people
[03:33:24.060 --> 03:33:27.300]   and the Polish people and the Romanian people especially
[03:33:27.300 --> 03:33:29.260]   and the Hungarian people.
[03:33:29.260 --> 03:33:31.460]   And it's just,
[03:33:31.460 --> 03:33:36.420]   there's so many moments of great joy that,
[03:33:36.420 --> 03:33:41.420]   just tears coming down my face because you're like in Prague
[03:33:41.420 --> 03:33:45.500]   when Dubcek, again, who tried to liberalize in 1968.
[03:33:45.500 --> 03:33:46.980]   And then when they sent the tanks,
[03:33:46.980 --> 03:33:48.500]   they deport him to Slovakia somewhere
[03:33:48.500 --> 03:33:49.860]   to do some forestry job.
[03:33:49.860 --> 03:33:51.900]   Like he appears in their big squares
[03:33:51.900 --> 03:33:53.020]   just waving from the balcony,
[03:33:53.020 --> 03:33:56.740]   like this ghost from 20 years prior being like,
[03:33:56.740 --> 03:34:01.500]   look, the spirit of '68 is still alive here
[03:34:01.500 --> 03:34:02.540]   in Czechoslovakia.
[03:34:02.540 --> 03:34:04.340]   And it was like a matter of weeks,
[03:34:04.340 --> 03:34:06.780]   the entire government resigned and then they liberalized.
[03:34:06.780 --> 03:34:11.780]   It's just so many things about just overnight,
[03:34:11.780 --> 03:34:14.700]   just change for the profound better.
[03:34:14.700 --> 03:34:19.980]   And people are so committed
[03:34:19.980 --> 03:34:22.700]   to making sure you don't have hope.
[03:34:22.700 --> 03:34:23.660]   And if things get better,
[03:34:23.660 --> 03:34:24.500]   oh, it doesn't really matter
[03:34:24.500 --> 03:34:26.300]   'cause the broader picture never gets better.
[03:34:26.300 --> 03:34:29.220]   And there's lots of data to the contrary
[03:34:29.220 --> 03:34:30.540]   where that's happened before.
[03:34:30.540 --> 03:34:32.980]   And this isn't some magical faraway place.
[03:34:32.980 --> 03:34:35.740]   This is the opposite of magical faraway place.
[03:34:35.740 --> 03:34:37.460]   It's Eastern Europe.
[03:34:37.460 --> 03:34:40.380]   - And to me, I think one such narrative
[03:34:40.380 --> 03:34:43.940]   that people assume will always be true
[03:34:43.940 --> 03:34:45.860]   or just to a degree will always be true
[03:34:45.860 --> 03:34:50.780]   like in American politics is the extreme levels of division.
[03:34:50.780 --> 03:34:53.340]   And it seems to me like that too, we can overcome.
[03:34:55.060 --> 03:34:57.900]   So the division in American politics
[03:34:57.900 --> 03:34:59.300]   that seems to be counterproductive,
[03:34:59.300 --> 03:35:00.760]   I think that can be overcome.
[03:35:00.760 --> 03:35:07.060]   And I think the division in geopolitics currently
[03:35:07.060 --> 03:35:10.620]   with Russia, China, and the United States,
[03:35:10.620 --> 03:35:15.340]   particularly China and the United States can be overcome.
[03:35:15.340 --> 03:35:18.340]   And I think that requires great leadership
[03:35:21.340 --> 03:35:23.220]   that galvanizes the populace
[03:35:23.220 --> 03:35:26.340]   to the better angels of their nature.
[03:35:26.340 --> 03:35:27.580]   Like I have hope for that.
[03:35:27.580 --> 03:35:30.100]   People have become really cynical on social media
[03:35:30.100 --> 03:35:32.180]   and elsewhere in the way they talk.
[03:35:32.180 --> 03:35:35.480]   The liberals are destroying this country.
[03:35:35.480 --> 03:35:38.760]   The conservatives are destroying this country.
[03:35:38.760 --> 03:35:41.500]   This kind of language is becoming more and more popular.
[03:35:41.500 --> 03:35:45.780]   I think that's, I have hope that that's temporary.
[03:35:49.620 --> 03:35:51.980]   At least that's my white pill.
[03:35:51.980 --> 03:35:54.460]   I don't know if you have that kind of hope for,
[03:35:54.460 --> 03:35:59.460]   like what does hope look like for you in American politics?
[03:35:59.460 --> 03:36:02.140]   Forget American politics, American, the nation,
[03:36:02.140 --> 03:36:03.600]   the country, the people.
[03:36:03.600 --> 03:36:07.820]   - My hope,
[03:36:07.820 --> 03:36:14.660]   which I don't think is an unrealistic one,
[03:36:15.740 --> 03:36:20.740]   is that the next generation has a better life
[03:36:20.740 --> 03:36:25.860]   than you and I have had in this country.
[03:36:25.860 --> 03:36:30.860]   And I think anyone who thinks that America is over
[03:36:30.860 --> 03:36:36.940]   or is one president away from being destroyed
[03:36:36.940 --> 03:36:40.900]   cannot in good conscience call themselves a patriot.
[03:36:40.900 --> 03:36:44.420]   Because if you think America is so weak
[03:36:44.420 --> 03:36:49.300]   that it takes a Biden or a Trump or an Obama
[03:36:49.300 --> 03:36:52.520]   to irrevocably destroy it, then it's already a wrap.
[03:36:52.520 --> 03:36:56.460]   And I think that's just absolutely ridiculous.
[03:36:56.460 --> 03:36:58.340]   If you look what this country has survived,
[03:36:58.340 --> 03:37:02.620]   Great Depression, World War II, the Civil War.
[03:37:02.620 --> 03:37:03.660]   I mean, my God.
[03:37:03.660 --> 03:37:05.700]   So we've been through worse before.
[03:37:05.700 --> 03:37:09.540]   It wasn't always easy, certainly not.
[03:37:09.540 --> 03:37:11.080]   But I am,
[03:37:12.660 --> 03:37:15.300]   it's so hard for me as someone who's a hopeful person,
[03:37:15.300 --> 03:37:18.420]   not by my nature, I'm not Michael Kindness
[03:37:18.420 --> 03:37:19.540]   who does work for Random House,
[03:37:19.540 --> 03:37:22.180]   or at least he did last time I talked to him.
[03:37:22.180 --> 03:37:24.500]   I look at even like,
[03:37:24.500 --> 03:37:27.580]   the thing is when you speak positively, it sounds corny.
[03:37:27.580 --> 03:37:29.660]   That's how screwed up our cynical culture is.
[03:37:29.660 --> 03:37:31.020]   - Have you seen my Twitter?
[03:37:31.020 --> 03:37:34.320]   - Oh, you're verified now.
[03:37:34.320 --> 03:37:35.160]   So that's good.
[03:37:35.160 --> 03:37:37.620]   But even like something like Etsy.
[03:37:37.620 --> 03:37:38.900]   Like you can go on Etsy--
[03:37:38.900 --> 03:37:40.660]   - I paid $8 for that verification.
[03:37:40.660 --> 03:37:42.900]   (laughing)
[03:37:42.900 --> 03:37:45.140]   I earned it.
[03:37:45.140 --> 03:37:47.660]   - It's an opportunity for independent artists
[03:37:47.660 --> 03:37:49.980]   to create something special and cool.
[03:37:49.980 --> 03:37:51.380]   And I've bought a lot of stuff from them.
[03:37:51.380 --> 03:37:53.860]   That in and of itself is something that's pretty awesome.
[03:37:53.860 --> 03:37:57.100]   There's so much, I'm into shaving soaps, right?
[03:37:57.100 --> 03:37:58.820]   - Of course you are.
[03:37:58.820 --> 03:38:02.000]   - The point is there's like dozens of artisans.
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:06.580]   Every day when you have a shave, it brings you some joy.
[03:38:06.580 --> 03:38:09.520]   So there's just so many things that are wonderful.
[03:38:09.520 --> 03:38:12.140]   And I know there's people listening to this,
[03:38:12.140 --> 03:38:13.380]   rolling their eyes.
[03:38:13.380 --> 03:38:16.940]   How can you talk about shaving soaps when my daughter
[03:38:16.940 --> 03:38:19.300]   or when my wife or when blah, blah, blah,
[03:38:19.300 --> 03:38:22.140]   and I'm not disparaging or dismissing
[03:38:22.140 --> 03:38:24.100]   what you're regarding as a problem.
[03:38:24.100 --> 03:38:27.660]   My point is hope means the belief
[03:38:27.660 --> 03:38:30.060]   that it's not at all a certainty
[03:38:30.060 --> 03:38:32.460]   that this problem will be insurmountable.
[03:38:32.460 --> 03:38:33.760]   That's all it means.
[03:38:33.760 --> 03:38:37.400]   - What do you look forward to in 2023?
[03:38:39.300 --> 03:38:41.000]   Since this is a holiday special.
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:47.680]   - Honestly, like if I look forward to a lot of young people
[03:38:47.680 --> 03:38:53.360]   realizing that they still have lots of opportunity
[03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:57.820]   in this country and taking control of their own selves
[03:38:57.820 --> 03:39:01.280]   and realizing they can be a better person tomorrow
[03:39:01.280 --> 03:39:03.680]   than they are today, that the entirety of their identity
[03:39:03.680 --> 03:39:05.480]   is not a function of a culture,
[03:39:05.480 --> 03:39:07.240]   which may they may not identify, or government,
[03:39:07.240 --> 03:39:09.100]   which they may not identify with or like,
[03:39:09.100 --> 03:39:12.600]   or think is deplorable and realize, you know what?
[03:39:12.600 --> 03:39:16.240]   I have it in me to improve and find joy and happiness.
[03:39:16.240 --> 03:39:21.160]   And also the fact that that is so compelling and contagious.
[03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:24.100]   That is what I would want in 2023.
[03:39:24.100 --> 03:39:26.000]   And also for New York to get nuked.
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:30.920]   - So those two things could be accomplished.
[03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:32.280]   - Can I go back and switch the order?
[03:39:32.280 --> 03:39:33.780]   'Cause I think New York won.
[03:39:33.780 --> 03:39:38.320]   - Oh, the jokes, the jokes.
[03:39:38.320 --> 03:39:41.440]   - And one day, friends, if you work hard enough
[03:39:41.440 --> 03:39:42.560]   and believe in yourself.
[03:39:42.560 --> 03:39:44.360]   - You too can nuke New York.
[03:39:44.360 --> 03:39:49.360]   - No, you too can spend your days dressing up,
[03:39:49.360 --> 03:39:59.360]   grown men dressing up in a Santa outfit
[03:39:59.360 --> 03:40:03.480]   and putting on lipstick and having hours upon hours
[03:40:03.480 --> 03:40:06.880]   of conversation with each other and loving every second.
[03:40:06.880 --> 03:40:09.080]   Thank you for writing this really, really important book.

[03:40:22.480 --> 03:40:24.200]   from Shel Silverstein.
[03:40:24.200 --> 03:40:29.200]   Listen to the muscles, child, listen to the don'ts.
[03:40:29.200 --> 03:40:32.580]   Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts.
[03:40:32.580 --> 03:40:36.240]   Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me.
[03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:38.360]   Anything can happen, child.
[03:40:38.360 --> 03:40:39.880]   Anything can be.
[03:40:39.880 --> 03:40:42.080]   Thank you for listening.
[03:40:42.080 --> 03:40:44.000]   I hope to see you next time.
