[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   I should like to call attention once more to the message of the 84th Psalm, Psalm number 84.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And for the sake of those who may not have been here last Sunday evening, and indeed for all our sakes, I think the best plan is to read the Psalm again.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Psalm 84.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord; My heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, Where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; they will be still praising thee.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee, in whose heart are the ways of them, Who, passing through the valley of Baccha, make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   They go from strength to strength; every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob; Behold, O God, our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand; I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord will give grace and glory; No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Now there, you see, this psalmist tells us about the blessings of the godly life, the blessings, if you like, of the religious life, of the Christian life.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And you notice that he makes a very remarkable statement.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   He is a man of very wide experience.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And there is very little doubt but that it is a psalm of David.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And a psalm probably written at the time when one of his own sons, Absalom, had led an insurrection against him.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And David had been forced to flee from the city of Jerusalem and to escape from his life.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   But even in those adverse conditions and circumstances, the one thing that sustains him, the one thing in which he can rejoice, is his relationship to God.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And what he really is saying here is this, that he cares very little what may happen to him.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   He would sooner be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness and of the ungodly.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   He prefers to be without anything as long as he has God, rather than to have everything without God.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Now I say that this is a portrayal, therefore, and a representation of true religion.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   This is what true religion is.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   This is what it is meant to be, and this is what it is meant to do.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And therefore I start again this evening by asking the question,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Are we able to use this kind of language? Is this our experience? Are we able to face life like this men did?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Can we say honestly this evening that we would prefer to be bereft of everything that this world can give us,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and have God, rather than to have the whole world and not know God?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Have we experienced the joys and the blessings of religion as this men obviously had?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And are we able therefore to face the future with confidence and with assurance,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and to defy every conceivable circumstance, because we know that the man that trusteth in God is truly blessed?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Can we join him in saying, "Oh Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee."
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Now that is the question. In other words, we are looking at the psalm with this very practical intent and object in mind.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And that is why we should be so grateful for the psalm, because the psalmist not only tells us how he felt himself and what his position was,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   he gives us instruction. He shows us that there are certain things, certain conditions, which are absolute necessities,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   before anyone can ever enjoy what he was enjoying. And that is what we are considering.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Now this is a very important matter, because as I am never tired of trying to say,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   most people it seems to me get into difficulties over this whole question of faith, of religion, of Christianity, right at the very beginning.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It is in the realm of preliminary considerations that we all instinctively and by nature tend to go astray.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   There are people who have been concerned about these things all their lives,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and yet they have never been able to say that they are in the position of this psalmist.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   They are always desperate, they are always frantic, they are always trying to find God,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   and always trying to get into this position, but they have never got there.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And they don't know why. I suggest that their trouble invariably is that at the very beginning, somewhere or another, they have gone wrong.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It is the preliminary considerations that generally account for all our troubles.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Very well, as we are looking at this psalm and studying it, we are dealing with the preliminary considerations.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I dealt with the first and the most important last Sunday night.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And the first is just to ask this question, what is true religion?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And we saw there is only one answer to the question according to this man, and according to the whole of the Bible.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   True religion consists in knowing God. Nothing less.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   It is a knowledge of God. It is a personal relationship to God.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It isn't just living a good life. It isn't just being interested in studying and reading and so on.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   No, no. True religion is to be able to turn to him and to say, "My King and my God."
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   To know God. And to be in this personal relationship to him, which is so certain, and which is so safe and secure,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   that with the psalmist I say we can defy almost any conceivable circumstance.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   So we consider that. But we didn't leave it at that.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   You remember I pointed out as I closed how the psalmist also told us,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   the only way in which a man can ever get into that knowledge of God, there is only one place, the altars.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Oh, here it is, he says, "The place is this, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God."
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Oh, my dear friend, I do trust you are clear about this.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   There is only one way to know God and to find God.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   You've got to come to the altars that God himself has appointed.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   The burnt offerings, the sacrifices which were placed upon the altars,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Without the altar which is Calvary's cross and the death of the Son of God upon it,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   there is no knowledge of God. Thine altars and the altar of incense,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   the blessed person of the Lord Jesus Christ as our great high priest that transmits our prayers to God,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   there is no knowledge of God apart from him and apart from him crucified.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Very well, there is the first thing which we have been considering.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   But now, come along, let's go on, he's got another preliminary consideration.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   You notice that this man stakes the whole of his life and the whole of his position upon this thing,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   upon his religion, upon his relationship to God.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And indeed true religion calls upon us to do that.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   According to the whole teaching of the scriptures from beginning to end,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   a true religion either takes up the whole man or he hasn't got it.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   It's not partial. We saw that, didn't we? He says, "My soul longeth,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   My heart, my flesh, crieth out for the living God."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   The whole man. Indeed, let me put it like this.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Here is a man, you see, who doesn't hesitate to tell us quite plainly and clearly.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   He says, "This is everything to me and I have forsaken the world,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I have forsaken the tents of the ungodly and the wicked,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   and this is my all, my everything, I live for this, this is my life."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Now, he stakes everything on it.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   He commits himself totally, completely and exclusively to this.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And if you read the lives of all the saints who've ever adorned the life of the Christian church,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   you will find it's always been the same.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   In other words, if you want to know the blessings that this man enjoyed,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   well then you've got to make this the chief thing in your life or else you'll never know them.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   It's a committal.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   It's a staking of the whole we are and have upon this relationship to God.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Very well. Now then, that's a very big thing, isn't it?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   That is the thing to which the Bible calls us.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And therefore, one may very well ask this question.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   On what grounds should I do that?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Or you may put it like this to me personally.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   You may say, "On what authority do you call me to do that?"
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   What is the ultimate sanction in this matter?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   What is our final authority in this whole question of faith and of committal of ourselves to God?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   It's a drastic decision.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   A man cannot be a Christian without counting the cost.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   He has to pay a certain price, not to win his salvation,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   but because he's in the position of salvation.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   You can't have God and memory.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   You can't have light and darkness at the same time.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   You can't be walking on the narrow way and the broad way at the same time.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   It's one or the other, and there is a leaving and a taking up.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   There is a denial and there is a following.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Well, it's a momentous question, a momentous decision.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So that men may very well ask, "Well now, what is the sanction?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   What is the authority in this great matter?"
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Well, fortunately for us, the psalmist answers this second question also.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And here again, there is a great deal of confusion at the present time.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   The question is often asked by people today,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   "Why be religious? Why believe in God and why believe in Christ?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   What is the authority in this whole question?"
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And I think you will agree that there are large numbers today
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   who view it entirely like this.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   They want the benefits of religion,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   but they want them in their own way.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   There are many who say, "Yes, I would like to be able to speak like that psalmist.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   I'd like to know his peace and his joy and all that he's got.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   But I'm not interested in your doctrines.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I'm not interested in your theology.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I'm not interested in all the teaching of the church.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   I want these things, but I'm not interested in the way in which you're putting it."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Now I think you'll agree that there is a very common attitude today.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   I remember some six or seven months ago,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   quoting to you the statement of the Lord Provost of one of the great cities of this country,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   who made a statement like this.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   He was addressing a religious conference that met in that city,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   and this is how he put it.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   He said, "Now I'm just a plain ordinary man.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I'm not interested in doctrine. I'm not interested in your theology."
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   He says, "I really haven't got the time for that.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   I'm just a plain ordinary man, but what I want to know is this.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   How can a man love his neighbor as himself?"
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   You see, he wants the benefits.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   He doesn't want a war.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   He's appalled at the possibility of war.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   He's distressed at the divisions in society and all the warfare that goes on.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   He doesn't like that, and he wants to put an end to that.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   But he says, "I want to get rid of all that in my way and not in your way.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I want your help, but you must give me your help in my way, not in your way."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Well now, I've come across another statement which says very much the same thing quite recently.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Listen to this.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   A man has recently written a book, which he calls "Emergence from Chaos."
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   He describes the chaos of the modern world,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and he has come to the conclusion that the only way to escape from the chaos of the modern world is religion.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   But this is how he puts it.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   He says, "Religion is not justified by its truth, but by its efficacy."
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Religion, he says, is not justified by its truth, but by its efficacy.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   In other words, what he says, again you see, can be put like this.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   He says, "I'm not interested in the truths of religion. All I want is a religion that works."
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   He says, "I don't care about your doctrines. I'm interested in results."
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And to me, he says, "What justifies a religion is that it works, not its truths."
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Now this is a very important matter.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   And I take it up with you because I want to try to show you that it is the exact opposite of what this psalmist teaches.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   The modern man says religion is justified not by its truth, but by its efficacy.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   The psalmist says, "The efficacy of what I have is dependent upon its truth."
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And if it isn't true, it isn't efficacious, it doesn't work.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   You see, there is an absolute cleavage. There is a complete division at this point.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And as this is such a very common attitude to religion today,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   and as it is misleading such large numbers of people,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I invite you to consider it with me briefly this evening.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   It is, I say, the very antithesis, not only of this man's teaching,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   it is a complete denial of the whole teaching of the Bible, the New Testament as well as the Old.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   This is a book of truth.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And if I'm not preaching truth tonight, whatever benefit may result from it is a false benefit.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Well now then, let me take up this statement and let's examine it.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Religion is not justified by its truth or its truths, but by its efficacy.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Let me first of all show you what is right about that statement.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   There is an element in it which is perfectly right.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I think what the man was trying to say was this,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   that after all religion is not something theoretical,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   but something which is essentially practical.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I imagine that what this man was trying to say was that the Church very often,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   and in many periods in her history, has been very full of learned theology,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   but it has been of no value to anybody at all.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   There have been periods in the Church when she has been absolutely orthodox, but utterly dead.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   There have been times within the living memory of some of us
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   when men in the Church have been tremendously concerned about doctrine and truth and theology and so on,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   but it didn't have the remotest effect upon their lives.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Now I say to that extent this statement is true.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And I am in very great sympathy with it at that point.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Alas, it is possible for men to have their heads packed with theology,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   but to have none of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in their hearts.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   There have been men in the past who knew their theology and their Bibles,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   but they were lacking in the ordinary milk of human kindness,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   leave alone the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   I think this man is fundamentally protesting against that, at least that's what he intends to do.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   And I am very certain that there are thousands, millions, outside the Christian Church tonight for that very reason.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   They said, "The Church so often in the past has just been talking theoretically,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   and it hasn't touched life." And they say, "That's of no value."
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I agree, it is of no value.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Religion is meant to be the most practical thing in the world.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   That's the whole case of the psalmist, isn't it?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   He isn't a man who is just writing poetry or writing psalms,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   seated in a study and in a library with everything going well.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   No, no, he is King David fleeing from Jerusalem, losing everything as it were,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   with all things driving him almost to despair.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   He says, "No, I am not in despair. God is with me, my King and my God."
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   It's practical, and it's meant to be practical.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And if your religion, I say again, isn't the biggest thing in your life and the most wonderful thing in your life,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   then I would ask you to query very seriously whether you have it at all.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   It's the sort of thing that not only makes a man sing like this psalmist,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   it enables a man like the Apostle Paul to say,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   "I know both how to be abased and how to abound.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   That's it. It doesn't matter where he is.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And standing as a prisoner before a gripper and festers, he says,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   "I would to God that you were like I am, apart from these chains."
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   He's sorry for them. They're free. He's a prisoner.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And yet he knows he's got something they haven't got.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   That's the religion. It's the most practical thing in the world.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   I believe this man's trying to say that.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   But alas, he says it in such a way that he denies the very essence of the Christian faith.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   So I come to consider with you what is wrong in his statement.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And the first thing that is wrong in his statement, you see,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   is this, he makes a completely false deduction.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Religion, he says, is justified not by its truths, but by its efficacy.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   What's the wrong deduction? Well, you see, the wrong deduction isn't it is this.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   He has argued that the only thing that matters about a religion is that it works.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And that if anything works, it must be true.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And that is the prime fallacy.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Now let me give you a simple illustration, one that is often used in books of logic,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   to show you exactly how a man can go astray in this way.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   You see, here is a man who's saying, "I'm not a bit interested in the truth of your religion.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   I'm not interested in your doctrines and in your dogma and in your theology.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   All I'm concerned about is the efficacy.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   If it makes me feel better and happier and more comfortable, it's all right.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I thank God for it. I don't care what the truth is."
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Now, you see, this is the error he's made.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Take the following statements.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   "When it has been raining, the streets are wet."
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Now that's a true statement, isn't it?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   "When it rains, the streets are wet."
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   But is it therefore true to go on to say this?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   "The streets are wet, therefore it must have been raining."
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Is that true? Of course it isn't true.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   It is absolutely true to say, "When there is rain, the streets are wet."
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Because religion is true, it is efficacious.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Ah, but if you put it the other way around, it isn't of necessity true.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   "The streets are wet," ah, says this man, "therefore it must have been raining."
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I say no. It may be that the city council has sent the water carts around,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   and that they have been spraying the streets.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Very well.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   You are perfectly right to laugh at that.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   It's the only thing to do with it that is the precise fallacy of which this man is guilty.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Knowing, you see, that religion is meant to be practical and efficacious,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   he says, "If a thing is efficacious, I'm not interested in the truth."
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   As long as it's efficacious, all is right.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   That's a completely false deduction.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   That is thoroughly bad logic, without going any further.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Yet there are thousands of people arguing like that tonight.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   They say, "Why do you talk about your doctrines? I'm not interested in your facts."
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   "I want a bit of comfort and of help."
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   "Why do you waste the time with all these things? Give me what I want."
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   My answer is, "I can't give you what you want, except in my way."
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Truth first, not efficacy only.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Or let me put it to you like this.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   This man's statement is guilty of a false antithesis.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   He puts up as opposites things which are complementary.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   He puts into contrast truth and efficacy.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   He doesn't realize that truth and efficacy should never be divided.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   These things are not opposites, they're not antitheses, they're not contradictions.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   These things belong together, and they must never be put one over against another.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   But this, as you know, is the vogue at the present time.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   We are living in an age when people say, "You can't describe these doctrines, and you mustn't attempt to do it."
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   "Don't waste time. That sort of thing divides."
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   "Let's all believe in Christ somehow. Let's all get the benefits of religion."
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   But you're putting up as antitheses things which should never be divided.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   But still more serious.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   The man is setting up an entirely false standard.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And this is, I say, where the thing really becomes alarming and dangerous to the soul.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   "I am interested only," says this man, in effect, "in the efficacy of religion."
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   We've already had these two world wars in this twentieth century, and life is full of strain,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   and of hardship and of hardness.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And I've tried to solve the problem and the mystery, but I can't, and I'm in trouble.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Now he says, "Is religion the answer?"
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   "Has religion got it?"
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And he has come to the conclusion that it has,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   because he has found a certain amount of peace and of happiness and of rest in religion.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   But alas, you see, he puts that up as his only test.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   It's the only thing he's interested in.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   It's very natural at a time like this.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Whenever the world is in a period of great trouble and of travail,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   men and women are looking for comfort and of solace and for peace, wherever they can find it.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   They say, "Can't I somehow get rest somewhere?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   I want to be able to sleep."
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Insomnia is so common, and the strain and the fret and the breakdown of nerves,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   and of the whole of life, it's all on the increase.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   And men and women are looking for something to ease the pain and to soothe their tired nerves,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   something to give them a little comfort and a little rest.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And alas, you see, they're so concerned about that and so interested in that,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   that like these men I'm quoting, they're interested in nothing else.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   They say efficacy alone matters.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Now what is the danger here?
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Well, the danger here, you see, is this.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   There are many other things besides the Christian faith that can give that kind of thing.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I needn't waste your time in detailing them,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   but there are many ways whereby people avoid their problems and get a kind of peace.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   There are people who take to drink for that reason.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   There are people who take to drugs for that reason.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   And while they're under the influence, they're perfectly happy.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   They've forgotten the problems.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   They no longer are conscious of them.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   They say everything's marvelous.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Everything in the world is perfect.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   They've got peace.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   They're very happy.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   But it's all the result of drugs.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   There are others who just pull down the blinds, as it were,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and refuse to face the facts of life, and they get a kind of temporary peace.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   As long as they're not seeing it, they say they're happy.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   But it's still there outside the window.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And there are many false teachings and cults.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And it's no part of the preaching of the Christian faith to say
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   that those things can't produce results.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   They most certainly can.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   I think I've said from this pulpit before that I've known several of them
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   that make people a most amazing temporary peace and rest.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   If you are just looking out for something that's going to make you feel a little bit happier,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   well then I say they can do it, many of them, Christian science and many others.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Cults, philosophic rubbish, they can make people feel very much better.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   The cults thrive on that sort of thing, false religions and cults.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   So that the moment we say that nothing matters but the efficacy
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   is irrelevant and that a religion is not justified by its truth,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   there is no answer at all to the cults, there is no answer to psychology,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   there is no answer to psychotherapy and these other agencies
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   that can really make a man feel better.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Indeed you may even give a man a kind of electric shock,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and that will solve his problem temporarily.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   But does that mean that you really have dealt with it in the radical manner?
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   No, no.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   The moment you put efficacy as the standard,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   you are opening the door to these other agencies,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   and you've got no test at all.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Not only that, it can be the most dangerous thing of all for the soul.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And what I mean is simply this,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   there is nothing more dangerous than a false peace.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Because you see, having a false peace, you think everything is all right.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   There is a kind of lull, and you say, "It's gone, I'm perfectly happy,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   everything is quite all right within me."
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   But the question is, my friend, is your peace a true peace or a false peace?
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   I must fall back again on the illustration that I've so often used in this pulpit.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   It's the simplest thing in the world for the physician or the surgeon
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   to give that injection of morphia to the man who is writhing in agony
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   with the pain of appendicitis.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And the moment that morphia gets going and becomes active,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   the pain is gone and the patient is no longer in trouble.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Yes, but he's still got his fulminating appendix.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   And if it isn't taken out, it will kill him.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   It's one thing to get rid of pain, it's one thing to get rid of symptoms,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   it's one thing to feel happier for the moment,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   it's one thing to lose the sense of strain,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   it's one thing to have a kind of peace.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   But the vital question is, what is the nature of the peace?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Is it a true peace, is it a false peace?
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   You can have a false peace and there's nothing more dangerous to the soul
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   because the man who thinks he's got it is no longer seeking for the true.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   He's in a worse state than he was before.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   It's better to be in pain than to have a false peace.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Because the pain will make you go on seeking, will urge you to go on searching.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   But finally, the terrible danger about this false peace and the false remedy is just this,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   that it lets you down in the final crisis.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   It's of no value to you when you need it most of all.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   "I'm only interested in efficacy," says this man, "I'm not interested in truth."
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   "And having taken up religion in this vague way, I feel better and happier."
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   All right, my friend, but wait a minute.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   When you're lying on your deathbed, what then?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   When you're beyond it, what then?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Is it your feelings that are going to count then?
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   No, no, it's your position that will count then.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Very well, I say, there is nothing according to this psalmist
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   and according to the whole Bible which is quite so dangerous
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   as to put up as contrasts truth and efficacy.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Very well, having discussed in that way the negative, let me put it to you positively.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   This man's whole position is based upon truth.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   It is because of his knowledge of truth and his certainty with respect to truth
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   that he speaks as he does.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   His whole case is that this is truth. He relies upon the truth concerning God.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And because of that, he cares not what's going to happen.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And that is the whole case for the Christian faith and for the Christian religion.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   The primary business of the Christian faith is not to give us peace nor joy.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   It is to bring us to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   It is the will of God, says the Apostle Paul to Timothy,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   that all men should be saved and be brought to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   And all the benefits and the blessings of religion as this man expounds them
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   result from that knowledge of the truth.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And whatever blessing we may seem to be enjoying,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   if it doesn't come out of a knowledge of the truth,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   I say it is the most dangerous thing for the soul.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Truth first, knowledge of the truth. All else is going to follow.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Or to put it in a different way to you,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   nothing matters in the realm of religion except the truth,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   which leads to the efficacious results.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   I put it therefore in this form that the Christian faith is historical.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   It is not theoretical.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   And my business is to stand in this pulpit and put certain truths before you.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   I am here to tell you that this Christian faith is based upon facts,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   upon what God has done in history.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   And if my facts and if my truths are not correct,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   well then my whole case collapses.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Did you notice how the Apostle Paul put it in that first epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 15?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   He says there are some people who are denying the fact of the resurrection.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   They are even denying the very possibility of the literal, physical resurrection of the body.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   And do you notice what he says?
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   "If Christ be not risen from the dead,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   then your faith is in vain and our preaching is in vain.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Ye are yet in your sins."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   You see the Apostle says, "Are you saying to me the truth doesn't matter?
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   It doesn't matter whether Christ rose or not.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   The only thing that matters is that a man feels better or happier when he believes in Christ."
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   No, no, says Paul. I stand or fall on this fact.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   If Christ be not risen, no one will rise.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   If in this life only we have hope in Christ, then we are of all men most miserable.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   If a man goes through this world as a Christian in a wrong sense,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   and finds at the end that it's all in vain, there's no one more miserable.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Why? Well, he's believed a lie.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   The facts are all important.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   The Christian faith is based upon truths.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   This is history. This isn't philosophy. It isn't teaching.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   And I'm here to announce certain facts, certain truths.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   My dear friend, I know you want to be blessed. It's all right.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   I want to be blessed. We all want to be blessed.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   But what I'm saying is this.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   If you really want the blessings that the psalmist enjoyed,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   well then you've got to accept the truths that he believed.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   It's the only way.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   What then is the nature of this truth?
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   What are these facts about which I am speaking?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Well, you notice that in the case of this psalmist, the thing is perfectly plain and clear.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   It's all based upon the character of God,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   not upon his feelings.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   "How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   My soul longeth, even fainteth, for the courts of the Lord my God, my King."
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   "O Lord of hosts, O God, O Lord God of hosts."
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Listen to him. Notice the name. That's why I read the psalm again.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   He repeats the name of God. He likes using the term "Lord."
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   You remember we saw last Sunday night, why?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Well, his confidence is in this, the character of God.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Not what he feels, but God being what he is.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Now then, let me put this to you very briefly, merely in a number of headings.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Would you like to know God in this way?
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Would you like to be able to pray to God with confidence?
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   When all things seem against you to drive you to despair,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   would you like to be able to go as this man went right into the presence of God,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   and know that God is there?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Very well, says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, if you do, this is the way.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   "He that cometh unto God must believe that he is,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   That's it.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   That man in that eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   is looking back at the Old Testament saints.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   The men who went through this life and through this world without faltering and failing,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   the men who were more than conquerors, what was their secret?
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   It was this, their knowledge of God.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   They believed that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   What does it mean? Well, let me put it in my headings.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   To know these blessings you start by believing in the eternal God.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Well, now that's a truth, isn't it?
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   That's one of the truths that the modern man, you see, says he's not interested in.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Religion is not justified by its truths.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Yet if I don't know that there is God and that he is the eternal God, what have I got?
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   I must start with God, the eternal God, the Lord of hosts.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   But then I must remember another thing about God.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Here is another truth that is absolutely essential.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   God is not only eternal and almighty and absolute in all his powers,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   God is the judge of all the earth.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   God is the judge of all men.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   What is the message of the Bible?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   In a sense it's epitomized in one verse.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   I'm telling you the kind of thing that sustained this psalmist,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   the things on which his confidence was based.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   He believed not only that God is and that he is eternal,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   he believed that God is the judge of all men,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   the judge of the spirits of all men, the judge of all the earth.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   That's the message of this book.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Another truth that is absolutely vital is this,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   that because God is holy, he hates sin.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   And his wrath is kindled against sin.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   "Ah," says many a modern man, "now there you are, you're bringing in these doctrines.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   I don't like this conception of the wrath of God.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   I want peace and comfort, my dear friend."
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   If you want peace and comfort that's true, you can only get it from God.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   And you've got to take God as he is.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   You must listen to the truth about God.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   God hates sin, he said so.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   He's revealed his hatred and he has said that he is going to punish it
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   and punish it eternally.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   That's the truth.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Not only that, God has also revealed that he has made a provision for our sin.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   I've already mentioned it at the altars.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   He's made the provision in Christ.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   And if you don't accept the truth about Christ, you don't know God.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   The altars are essential.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Very well, there's another truth, and it's absolute and it can't be moved.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   Here's another.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   God's promises to those who believe in him through Christ.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   "He that cometh unto God must believe that he is,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   This is the thing on which this man was resting.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   The character of God.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   God's promise, and God will never break a promise.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   He has promised to bless his people.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   He'll bless them in time.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   He'll bless them in death.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   He'll bless them in eternity.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And this is the most wonderful thing of all.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   The certainty of the promises of God.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   How can I know that they're certain?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Well, I know that the promises of God are certain
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   because of the character of God.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   God is unchangeable.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   God is absolute light in every sense.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   He is the father of lights, with whom is no variableness,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   neither shadow of turning.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   What God has said, God will do.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   What God has promised, God will perform.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   God doesn't say and withdraw.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   God starts, God continues.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   The unchangeable character of God.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   That's the thing this man relies on.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   He says something like this,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   "God," he says, "is a sun and a shield.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly."
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   The character of God.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   How can you have confidence if you haven't this truth about God?
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   If God is like a man, well, then I have no confidence.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   My whole confidence is based upon the truth about God.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   The unchanging, the unchangeable God.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Can't you see the importance of truth, my friend?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Can't you see how ridiculous it is to divide truth from efficacy?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   This man's whole position lies in this,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   that he knows that God is what he is,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   and that he is related to him,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   and therefore all is well with him.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   The truth about God.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Well, says someone,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   "How do I know that truth, and how can I be sure of it?"
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Well, this is the answer.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   It's revelation.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   God has revealed it about himself.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   You can see it in nature and creation.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   The seasons, the sun, the moon, the stars, the rain,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   the fructification of crops.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   It's God.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   God has left the mark of his fingers.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   It's to be seen in nature.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   That's Paul's argument at Lystra.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And then it is to be seen in the history of the Jews.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Read your Old Testament history.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   This man, this psalmist, this King David, he knew the history.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   He knew about the call of Abram.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   He knew the promises given to him.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   He knew that Abram's people had gone down to Egypt,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   and there they seemed to be on the point of being exterminated.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   But they were not exterminated. Why?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   God is the God of Abram, Isaac, and of Jacob,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   the God of the promises.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And he must bring them out, and he did bring them out.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   The character of God is a guarantee in the darkest hour.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   He brought them through the Red Sea.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   He took them into Canaan.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   He destroyed their enemies.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   God is true to his word. He is unchangeable.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   History.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   The very history and story of the Jews alone
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   is a proof of the truth of religion and of the character of God.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And then you come to the Bible,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   and you read those prophecies in the Old Testament,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   and you see their fulfillment in the New.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   You see the detailed prophecies about Christ,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   and the detailed fulfillment. What is it?
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   It is God revealing centuries beforehand what is going to come to pass,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   and which has come to pass.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Here is the evidence. Here is the certainty. Here is the proof.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Read your Bibles. It is a manifestation of God.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   It is God revealing himself, giving a message to a prophet,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   the prophet writing it, and the fulfillment centuries later.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   That is God seeing the end from the beginning.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   That is the God in whom the psalmist trusts.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   But of course, supremely and finally,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   we see it all in the Son of God,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Why do I trust God tonight? Here is one of my answers to your question.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Christ said, "He who hath seen God, he who hath seen me, hath seen the Father."
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Very well, I have seen him. I see him in the four Gospels.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   I know I can believe him. I know I can trust him.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   I know his heart of compassion and of love.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   I know that he never gave a promise without fulfilling it.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   I will trust him with everything.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   God is like that.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   I will risk my life in his hands.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   I will risk everything I have in his hands.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   The character of God is seen in Christ.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   And not only that, I see his power. I see his everything.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   I look at that marvelous birth of Christ, and I see God revealing himself.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   I look at the miracles, and I see the power of God.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   I look at the death and the cross, and I see the love of God.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   I look at the resurrection, and I know that he is God, Jesus, Son of God,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   proved by the resurrection, risen again from the dead, the last enemy conquered.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   He has triumphed over the grave.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   There is my confidence.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   But you see that it is based entirely upon the historical facts about Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   The fact of his birth, miraculous birth, virgin birth,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   the fact of his working miracles,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   the fact of his literally dying on the cross,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   the fact of his literal burial,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   the fact of his literal resurrection,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   there is my evidence.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   And if I do not believe the facts, I have nothing.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   I may go home with a comfortable feeling, having sung a number of hymns and choruses.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   I may be soothed into feeling that all is well.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   I may be treated psychologically, and I have forgotten my problems.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   I have been stunned for a moment.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   But I cannot face life and death and eternity on that.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   But I can on these facts,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   that God the Son came from heaven into time,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   and gave proof that he was the Son of God.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   I say the supreme proof was the fact of the resurrection.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   "No, I have not preached unto you cunningly devised fables," says Peter.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   "These are not fairy tales nor stories.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   I was with him on the holy mount, and I heard the voice from heaven,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   and there is the resurrection."
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Hold on to the facts, truths, not efficacy.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   There is no real efficacy apart from truths.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   And finally, the mighty fact of Pentecost and the descent of the Holy Ghost.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Well, there it is.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   A Christian is a man who stakes his life, his death, his everything,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   upon those truths,
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   believing that God is, and that he is holy and just,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   and that he will have to stand before God in judgment,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   and believing that God hates sin and will pour his wrath upon it.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   This man who is a Christian, having believed that,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   flees from the wrath to come.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   He flies to Christ, the Son of God,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   who alone can save him and deliver him,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   and who has done so by dying for him.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   He flies to him.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   He forsakes the world and sin.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   He gives himself to God in Christ.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   He denies himself.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   He takes up the cross, and he follows after Christ.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   He says, "Let the world deride or pity.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   I will glory in thy name."
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   He sets his affections on things above, not on things on the earth.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   He leaves the tents of the ungodly.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   He becomes a doorkeeper in the house of God.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   He says, "I care not what happens to me.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Here I rest,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   because the Lord of hosts is my King and my God."
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   It is the facts, the truth.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   And without it, he has nothing.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   He therefore can say,
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   "My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   I dare not trust my sweetest frame,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   but wholly lean on Jesus' name.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   On Christ, the solid rock I stand.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   All other ground is sinking sand."
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Have you believed the facts?
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   Have you seen the importance of truth?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   It isn't whether you feel happy or miserable.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   It isn't whether you've got peace or not.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   The thing that matters is God and you,
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   and you'll stand before him.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   And there's only one way to escape the rock.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   It is to believe on Jesus Christ and him crucified
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   and to cast yourself unreservedly at his feet and upon his love.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   It's the truth that matters.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   And having the truth, you will find it to be efficacious.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Amen.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
