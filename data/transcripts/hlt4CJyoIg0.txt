[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.840]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the fifth chapter and the first two verses. The first
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.700]   two verses in chapter five of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians. "Be ye therefore followers
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:30.680]   of God as dear children, and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.360]   himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour."
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.640]   These remarkable and astonishing words come here in the midst of a section that we have
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.280]   been considering for some time until the break for the summer vacation, a section which can
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.880]   be described as the practical section of this great epistle to the Ephesians. And if we
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.480]   are to understand this remarkable statement, it is very essential that we should bear in
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.720]   mind its context and its background. That is important, of course, with any verse of
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.040]   Scripture. It is a dangerous thing just to extract a verse and take it right out of its
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.560]   context. That is how most heresies have arisen in the Church, because texts have been taken
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.240]   out of their context. But apart from that, it is quite clear that a letter like this
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.440]   in particular, or any particular argument in it, simply cannot be understood at all
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.560]   unless it is taken in its full context. And this is particularly necessary with regard
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.720]   to these words that we are looking at together this morning.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:58.800]   So as we resume these studies in the epistle to the Ephesians, it is vital that we should
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.040]   hurriedly remind ourselves of the complete setting. Now, this epistle, as we have had
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.560]   many occasions to see, can be divided into two main sections. The first three chapters
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.440]   are doctrinal. He unfolds and expounds the glorious doctrines and fundamental tenets
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.800]   of the Christian faith. Then, having done that, he begins in chapter 4, in verse 1,
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.560]   to apply all this. "I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye work worthy
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.600]   of the vocation wherewith ye are called." He has already been telling them what that
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.480]   is, and now he is anxious that they should work and walk in a manner that is worthy of
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.880]   that. In other words, in chapter 4 he begins his practical application. But even then,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.440]   as we saw, he still feels that he must remind them of the full doctrine of the Church, the
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.240]   nature of the Church, and the unity of the Church. So he goes on to verse 16 in chapter
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:09.000]   4 in doing that. Having done that, in verse 17 of chapter 4, he really does come down
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.200]   to personal matters, to things which are thoroughly practical, mundane, and ordinary, in order
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.360]   to show how this glorious life into which they have been brought is something that expresses
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.240]   itself in every detail of life. "We are not only Christians on Sunday," he is saying
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.040]   in effect, "we are Christians always, wherever we are. Not only in the Church of God, in
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.280]   the building, we are Christians in every relationship of life, in all our speech and conversation,
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.600]   in all that we handle of other people's property, and all these things."
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:53.720]   Well, now, then, there is the general background. But it is also important for us to remember
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:03.560]   his exact method in dealing with these intensely practical and ordinary matters. And his method,
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.200]   you remember, is this. It is not only his method; it is the method of every writer in
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   the New Testament. It is the essential approach of the New Testament to all matters of conduct
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.160]   and behavior, ethics and morality.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:29.040]   Well, what is this principle? What is this method? Well, it is this. It is always in
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:39.400]   terms of doctrine. It is always in terms of the truth that we have believed. That, we
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.760]   have been reminding ourselves, is the peculiar thing about Christian interest in our behavior.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:54.600]   If you like the technical term, that is the differentia of Christian ethics. And so, though
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.160]   the apostle, as I say, in a sense has dealt with the doctrinal section of his letter,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.280]   and has come to the intensely practical and ordinary, he cannot do that, he cannot handle
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.480]   that even, without constantly bringing in his doctrine. And that is the characteristic
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.680]   of this final section from the seventeenth verse in chapter four, right to the end of
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.440]   the epistle. It is a constant alternation between particular doctrines and their application.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.000]   The whole time he keeps on keeping these two things together. Why? Well, it is in order
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.880]   to bring out certain principles, and here are some of them. I am merely mentioning them
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.260]   to remind you of the background this morning.
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:49.000]   The New Testament is not interested in goodness in and of itself. Now, the world is, of course.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.760]   Everybody is. Anybody who believes in morality is interested in goodness. And if it is non-Christian
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.560]   morality, the thing that characterizes it is that it is interested in goodness in and
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.760]   of itself, and for its own sake. Goodness, quae goodness. They say it is a good thing
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.920]   to be good. Honesty is the best policy. It is a good thing for society that people should
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:23.080]   observe certain rules and orders and regulations. Now, that is the worldly, the non-Christian
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.340]   view of goodness. But it is not the Christian view. The Christian is not interested in goodness
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:36.600]   merely for the sake of goodness. No, no. He is interested in conduct and behavior, and
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:46.440]   right conduct and behavior, always, only in terms of what God has done for us in and through
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.000]   the Lord Jesus Christ. Not the thing in itself, but the thing because of this other thing
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.040]   that is infinitely greater. Or, I can put it like this, as a second principle.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:10.480]   The Christian life is not a code that is imposed upon us without our understanding it. Now,
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.080]   that again tends to characterize the non-Christian views of morality and conduct, doesn't it?
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.480]   They are something that are imposed upon us. That is the characteristic of a law. Now,
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.640]   that is not the position here at all. This is not something that is just imposed upon
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.240]   us, and which we don't understand, but which we do simply because it has been imposed upon
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.920]   us. Now, this letter alone is enough to show that that isn't the position. The apostle
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.160]   keeps on giving us reasons for not doing this and for doing that. He wants us to understand
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:53.520]   it. And so, you see, he intermingles his doctrine, his reminders of doctrine, constantly with
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.440]   his practical exhortations. Or, let me put that again as another principle, a third principle,
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:06.880]   in this way. We must never practice the Christian life and do things that Christians do and
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:15.360]   avoid things that Christians don't do, merely because it is the thing to do, and merely
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.880]   because most Christian people do them. That again is not the Christian position. I think
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:28.320]   we'll all agree and realize that very often that is what does happen to many a young Christian.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.360]   He's converted, he comes into the Christian life, and then he's told, "Well, now this
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.880]   is the thing to do." And he does it because it's the thing to do. He doesn't know why,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.920]   he doesn't understand it, but that isn't how the New Testament would have us be. The
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:48.960]   New Testament wants us to know exactly why we are doing what we are doing, and why we
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:56.240]   don't do what we don't do. It's intelligent. It doesn't put us under a law. It always provides
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:03.000]   us with its reasons in order that we may have a true understanding and be able to give a
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.960]   reason for what we are doing. To me, there is nothing sadder than the type of Christian
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.640]   who is conforming to a code but doesn't quite know why, and is nervous and apprehensive
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.280]   that somebody will tackle them about this because they really can't give an explanation.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.640]   They're just doing it because the company they belong to are doing it, and they don't
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.280]   quite know why. Now, that's not only unintelligent, it's very, very poor Christianity. Here the
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:36.400]   apostle gives us reasons we must know, we must be able to explain. Or, to go on and
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:45.840]   put it more positively, let me put it like this. Our conduct must always arise from and
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:54.400]   be dictated by our doctrine. That's the positive way of looking at it all. Not mechanical,
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.600]   not being dragooned into it. No, no. But what we do and what we are and what we refrain
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:08.040]   from doing must always arise from our doctrine. It must be dictated by our doctrine. Indeed,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:19.120]   I'd go beyond that. Our conduct and our behavior should to us be inevitable, unavoidable, because
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:26.340]   of what we believe. Again, is there anything more sad than a Christian person who is painfully
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:34.080]   trying to live the Christian life, and who yet doesn't quite see why he should or should
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:41.200]   be living like this? Now, I say our conduct should be inevitable to us. We shouldn't feel
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:48.000]   it's grievous, as the apostle John puts it. He says to us his commandments are not grievous.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.840]   He means by that that he's not straining against them, he's not objecting to them, he doesn't
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.560]   dislike them. No, no. The Christian is a man who, having understood his doctrine, says
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.720]   there's no need to argue about this, the thing is inevitable. It follows of necessity as
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.960]   an inevitable deduction and conclusion from what he believes. Now, that's what the apostle
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:14.480]   is bringing out here. He says, if you really believe this, well then, you can't possibly
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.960]   go on like that, and you will begin to live like this. It's inevitable. It's something
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:27.920]   that follows as the night follows the day. It's unavoidable. That's a principle which
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.600]   seems to stand out here everywhere. Or, to finish these principles, the sixth and the
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:38.280]   last I would put to you is this one.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:48.240]   The grand motive always for Christian behavior is gratitude to God for what he's done for
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:56.280]   us in Jesus Christ our Lord. Christian conduct and behavior is not a law that's been dictated
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:05.520]   to us. It's meant to be an expression of our understanding of and our gratitude for what
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.560]   God has done for us in Christ. So that far from objecting and trying to get out of it
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.880]   and feeling it's hard and narrow and cramped, we should say, what a wonderful opportunity
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:24.280]   I have of showing my gratitude to him. Very well then, and because that is the final way
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:31.600]   of putting it, and because it is essentially a way of expressing one's gratitude, it follows
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.240]   a necessity, doesn't it, that we must understand it, because you can't thank God for something
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:43.640]   which you don't understand. And so, we must keep in our minds as we look at these particular
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:53.640]   injunctions and all these detailed exhortations, that that is the setting, that is the background.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:13:02.360]   Now then, we've already been considering the first applications of these great common principles
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:08.880]   that apply to all aspects of conduct and of behavior. We saw that his first principle
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:16.320]   which he deals with, starting at verse 17, was this. He says, "You must always remember
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:23.240]   that you have been born again. You are no longer like those other Gentiles. They remain
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.040]   what they were. You have received a new nature and a new life. But henceforth," he says,
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:35.240]   "therefore you don't walk as the other Gentiles walk. They just go on as you once were, but
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.880]   you are no longer that, you are a new man. So you put off the old man, you put on the
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.000]   new." And he's worked it out in detail for us. That was the first.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.080]   The second great doctrine which he introduced was the one he mentions in verse 30 of chapter
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:57.920]   4, where he says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:05.880]   of redemption." Now there's the doctrine that a Christian must always remember that the
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:12.920]   Holy Spirit of God dwells within him. "Know ye not that your bodies are the temples of
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.720]   the Holy Ghost that dwelleth in you? And ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.920]   price." There it is. The Holy Spirit is within us. We are always to remember that. And if
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.200]   we do remember that, well, it will govern our conduct. All bitterness and wrath and
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:34.440]   anger and clamor and evil speaking will be put away from us with all malice. And we will
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:42.080]   be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:47.160]   hath forgiven us. Now there are two illustrations of the method
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:55.760]   which we've already considered. And now we come to the third in these first two verses
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:02.640]   of this fifth chapter. And still his method is the same. He hasn't forsaken it, he's just
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:09.640]   going on with it. What is this next one? Well, here it is. "Be ye therefore followers of
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:18.280]   God as dear children, and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:29.680]   himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour."
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:38.520]   Will anyone disagree with me when I say that here we come to the supreme argument, to the
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:49.160]   highest level of all, to the ultimate ideal. There's nothing possible beyond this. This
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:58.640]   is the highest statement of the doctrine that one can conceive of or even imagine. It's
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:12.640]   really staggering. It's almost incredible. But here it is. "Be ye followers of God."
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:21.240]   That's the doctrine, that's the next principle. Now, it's interesting, from the mere standpoint
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.160]   of the mechanics, to know whether this belongs to the previous section or the one that's
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.400]   following. I frankly can't make up my mind. I really believe it belongs to both. It was
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.440]   partly suggested, I think, by what he said at the end of chapter 4, "Be ye kind to one
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:42.840]   another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:50.820]   you. Be ye therefore followers of God." And yet, you notice that the good men who divided
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.760]   up this letter into chapters, they put an end at chapter 4 and they started this new
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.560]   thing in chapter 5. And I believe there's a great deal to be said for that also. Because
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:09.200]   here he seems to me to be laying down what is, after all, a principle that governs everything.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.600]   He's gathering it all up, as it were, and then he will go on and draw his practical
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:22.560]   deductions from this in verses 3 to 5. But that really doesn't matter at all. The point
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:28.800]   is that the apostle is here reminding us of something that we must never forget in the
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:35.320]   whole of our life, all our thinking, all our conduct and practice and behavior. "Be ye
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:43.960]   followers of God as dear children." Now then, what does this mean? Well, you notice first
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:51.880]   of all that again he's introducing us to a principle of doctrine. In this most practical
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:57.920]   section where he's dealing with the most ordinary things in life, suddenly he throws
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.960]   in this. That's why these epistles are so romantic if you study them properly. You may
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.400]   say to yourself, "Well, I finished with my doctrine at the end of chapter 3. I can then
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   go on to something else." No, no, you can't. You haven't finished with doctrine. He can't
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.960]   talk about anything except in terms of the truth. And so suddenly, you see, when he's
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.760]   dealing with the most practical things in life, he suddenly hurls this upon us. And
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:29.240]   we stand before the most staggering and astonishing statement that we can ever face. What is it?
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:40.960]   Well, let's look at it. "Be ye therefore followers of God." Now, we have a better translation.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.860]   This word "followers" rarely doesn't bring it out as it should. What the apostle rarely
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:58.440]   said was this, "Become imitators of God." Indeed, become mimics of God. That's the word
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.840]   he used. Our word "mimic" comes from the very word the apostle used. We are to mimic God.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:15.500]   We are to imitate God. "Become," he says, "imitators of God." Is this possible? Isn't
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:22.060]   this a gross exaggeration? Hasn't the apostle run away with himself or allowed his eloquence
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:30.500]   to dazzle him? Is he seriously asking us to become imitators of God? Men and women like
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:37.260]   ourselves living in a world like this, surrounded by temptations and by the devil, with sin
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:46.300]   and evil and unworthiness within us, be imitators of God? Is it possible? Well, it's very important
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:55.940]   that we should be able to answer that question. And we answer it like this. We must look at
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:01.180]   God and we must consider God's being and nature. If I am to imitate God, I must know
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:08.260]   something about God. And thank God he has been graciously pleased to reveal himself
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:13.300]   to us. He does it in his word. Here we have the final revelation. We see it in the Lord
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:21.660]   Jesus Christ. And we are entitled, therefore, to say this, that there are certain attributes
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:30.220]   in God. But you can divide the attributes of God into two groups. There are attributes
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:37.060]   of God that are not communicable. There are certain things in God and about God that are
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:42.260]   only true of him, and we cannot imitate him in those respects. What do I mean? Well, I
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:50.780]   mean this, his glory. We can't imitate the glory of God. His eternity, his from eternity
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:56.900]   to eternity, his everlasting, that's an attribute of God. We can't imitate that.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:05.540]   His majesty. Who would be so foolish as to try to imitate the majesty of God? All these
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:12.420]   attributes I say, his omnipotence, his omnipresence, his omniscience, they are attributes of God.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:19.620]   But yes, but they are incommunicable. They cannot be communicated. They belong alone
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:25.340]   to God and they make God God. These are in God because he is God. And we are never called
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:33.020]   upon anywhere to imitate such attributes, the incommunicable attributes. Ah, but there
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:40.900]   are other attributes in God which are communicable. And they are communicable because they are
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.460]   moral in their nature. Now what are these? Well, that is, these are the ones that we
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:52.180]   must understand if we are truly to follow our text this morning. The communicable attributes
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:22:02.300]   of God include these, his holiness. "Be ye holy," says God, "for I am holy." There
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:08.580]   is an attribute of God, "I am holy." Yes, he says, "But be ye holy because I am holy."
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.580]   This is communicable. This is something that I am to imitate. As God is holy, I am to be
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:23.820]   holy. Righteousness. God is righteous and you and I are to be righteous. His justice,
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:31.020]   his goodness, his love, his mercy, his compassion, his tenderness, his long-suffering, his loving
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:37.180]   kindness, his faithfulness, his forgiveness, all these are attributes of God. Yes, and
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:42.900]   they are communicable attributes of God. You go through your Bible and you will find that
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.260]   somewhere or another you and I are expected to manifest these attributes. We are to have
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:53.420]   them. We are to show them. They are to be parts of our life and living. Well, now then,
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.900]   here you see comes an understanding of this particular exhortation. "Be ye therefore
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:06.620]   imitators of God." Become imitators, mimics of God. In what respect? In these respects.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:12.660]   That is why I say this thing is so staggering. And that is why doctrine is so important for
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:19.660]   us. You see, we are not just to be good people. We are to be imitators of God. It is so much
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:25.060]   higher. It is so much glorious. I am not to be straining and struggling just not to do
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.740]   those things, to keep as near as I can to them, just not do them, and so on, and object
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:37.700]   to having to live this. "Be ye imitators of God." Here is the appeal. And we only
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.540]   realize the greatness and the value and the staggering character of the appeal. As we
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.820]   realize the biblical teaching about the being and the nature of God and these two types
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:53.660]   of attributes. But here are attributes of God that are meant to come to us, and we are
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.740]   to manifest them and to display them. And that is what the apostle is exhorting us and
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:07.060]   these people to do. Very well, then. Let me ask a question. Why
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:16.100]   are we to be imitators of God? Why are we in these respects to be in our daily lives
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:23.940]   as God is? Well, the answer is here. It is obvious, isn't it? It is first and foremost
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:37.540]   because we are God's children. "Be ye therefore imitators of God, as children beloved."
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:42.300]   Now here, you see, we again enter into this realm that is so different from what the world
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:48.180]   knows. And that is why I often say from this pulpit that the greatest enemy of morality
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:55.980]   ultimately, the greatest enemy of Christianity eventually, is morality. The most unchristian
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:01.140]   people in the world today are those people who are living very good lives and are satisfied
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:08.980]   with it, and think that that is the acme. That, I say, is the opposite of Christianity.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.220]   Goodness for the sake of goodness. They are very good people, I know. But you see, this
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:19.580]   is something they know nothing at all about. Children of God. That is why we are to live
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.420]   this life and refrain from some things and to do others.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:29.020]   Now the apostle, of course, has already been reminding us of this. It is not a new idea
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:34.820]   that he suddenly introduces here. We saw it at the very beginning of the epistle. Listen
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:43.460]   to this. Chapter 1. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:49.060]   blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:54.060]   hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:26:02.260]   blame before him in love, having predestinated us"—to what?—"to the adoption of children
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:10.220]   by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will." And listen to
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:15.060]   him, he said it again at the end of chapter 2, in verse 19. "Now therefore," he says
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:21.820]   to these people, "ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:31.700]   saints and of the household of God." Children of God, adopted into the household and the
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:37.940]   family of God, belonging to God, related to God. Yes, the adoption of children. And of
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.700]   course if we don't understand this, we are missing the whole point of the Christian message
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:49.260]   and we'll never understand this appeal for conduct and behavior. As Christians, we are
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.020]   not merely believers. We are believers. You can't be a Christian without believing. But
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.340]   the Christian is not merely a man who has believed a certain body of doctrine or believed
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:03.180]   a truth. As Christians, we are not merely forgiven. We are forgiven, thank God. There
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:08.140]   would be no hope for us if we were not forgiven. But Christian, it is not merely to be forgiven
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:15.340]   and not to go to hell and to continue as you are, but forgiven all along. No, no. To be
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:22.380]   Christian is not merely even to be born again. It is that. There is nothing more glorious
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:28.180]   than it. Ah, but we must go beyond that. What does our rebirth mean? Well, it means this
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:36.660]   rebirth after the pattern and the fashion and the image of the Lord Jesus Christ. You
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:42.020]   remember, we have already been looking at this in chapter 4. "He put on the new men,"
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:51.020]   he says, "which after God is created in righteousness and holiness of the truth."
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:58.500]   The Christian is a child of God. He has been adopted into God's family. He is a partaker
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:03.780]   of the divine nature. He is born from above. He is born of the Spirit. And of course, the
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.260]   trouble with anybody who objects to living the Christian life is that they have no conception
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.300]   of that. They have never seen it at all. They are quite unaware of it. They think of Christianity
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.460]   as a moral code imposed upon them and they object to it. They want to be living something
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:23.580]   else. Well, poor things, they just are ignorant of Christianity. Here is the reason for living
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:34.580]   the Christian life. We are to be imitators of God because we are children of God. God's
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:41.300]   children, God's people. That is what Christianity means. Yes, but not only are we his children,
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:47.580]   you notice he says, "We are children beloved." It is a better translation than "dear children."
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:56.180]   It comes to the same thing, "children beloved." What does that add? Well, it adds this, that
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:04.500]   we are not only children of God in the sense that we are in that actual legal relationship.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:12.260]   We are children beloved. He has shown his love toward us. And he goes on doing so. He
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:21.100]   shows his care for us, his solicitude for us. Do you know, my friend, if you are a true
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:27.700]   Christian you are dear to God. I have the authority for the law of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:33.700]   for saying this. The very hairs of your head are all numbered. That is what he means by
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:40.100]   dear children, children beloved. Oh, it is not some great general notion. He knows us
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:46.900]   one by one. He is interested in us. The analogy is a human one. Yes, but we can multiply it
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:52.940]   by infinity. God's interest in and his concern for his children is infinitely greater than
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:30:02.140]   the greatest and the noblest natural parent's interest in his or her child. God is lovingly
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:11.260]   concerned about us. And he looks upon us and he watches us. As the natural parent watches
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:16.100]   his little child beginning to walk for the first time, as he goes out to school for the
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:21.020]   first time, as he goes away he stands and watches him until he goes round the corner.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:26.140]   That is an expression of that loving interest. It is not a mechanical relationship. No, no,
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:31.460]   dear children, children beloved. Well, now, says Paul, that is how God is to you. He is
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.740]   looking down upon you and he loves you, he is interested in you, you are dear to his
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:43.340]   heart. He is taking this intense personal interest in you. Here are the reasons. Well,
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:50.340]   how should that work out? Well, it should work out like this, shouldn't it? Quite inevitably.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:57.260]   If I believe and realize something of this truth, the greatest desire of my life should
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:09.260]   be to show my love to him and it should be to please him in everything. Nothing gives
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:15.020]   God greater joy, I say it on the authority of my text and on all the parallel texts in
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:21.820]   the Scriptures, nothing gives greater joy to God than to see his children living in
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:28.700]   a manner that is worthy of him. So if we are children worthy of the name, I say our supreme
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:37.500]   desire in life should be to please him and to give him joy. We are told, are we not,
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.780]   that there is joy amongst the angels of God over one sinner that repented. Of course there
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:46.740]   is, and the joy goes on increasing and increasing and it is even in the heart of God as his
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:51.740]   children go on and live in a manner that is worthy of him. Now there is no need to argue
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:57.860]   about these things. If you have got a loving parent and you love your parent, there is
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:02.660]   no need to persuade you or to exhort you or to try to dragoon you into the thing. If you
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.380]   know the parent's love and you love the parent, well, you will be looking for opportunities
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:15.700]   to please him or her. That is the argument, says the apostle. Become imitators of God
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:23.460]   as children, beloved. Or, to put it in a second way, the argument works out like this. If
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.700]   we realise the truth of this relationship, well then our greatest desire, of course,
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:37.020]   in life will be to be like God. Or you can work out these analogies for yourselves. But
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:43.220]   you look at a little boy who loves his father and who knows his father's love to him. What
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.540]   is that boy trying to do? Well, he is always trying to be like his father. Haven't you
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:54.180]   seen them? He likes to sit in his father's chair, likes to take his father's place, tries
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.860]   to walk like his father, tries to speak like his father. He is imitating his father the
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.260]   whole time. Why? Well, he is so fond of his father and he wants to grow up to be a man
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:08.380]   like his father. That is human nature, isn't it? That is ordinary human love at its best.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:13.140]   Again I say, cleanse it, multiply it by infinity and you discover what the apostle is trying
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:20.980]   to say. Become imitators of God. Why? Well, because he is your father. And any child worthy
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:26.900]   of the name imitates his father and wants to be like his father. He thinks his father
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.100]   is the strongest man in the world. He believes everything about his father. His father has
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:38.380]   all knowledge and he wants to be like his father. Become imitators of God. As children
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:34:04.380]   of God, as children of God, as children of God, as children of God, as children of God,
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:10.380]   we judge our families. That is why we are all so careful to give instructions to our
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.020]   children, however small they are, when they go out to a little party. We know that it
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.940]   isn't the children who are going to be criticised, it is the parents. Very well, it is perfectly
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:25.580]   right. The child is the representative of the family. And therefore he shouldn't be
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:31.940]   thinking of himself so much as of the family. "No man liveth unto himself," says Paul
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:38.780]   to the Romans, "no man dieth unto himself. To his Lord every man standeth." And we,
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.700]   if we are Christians, we cannot divorce ourselves from our relationship to God. We can't say,
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.860]   "I want to be saved, I don't want to go to hell, I want to be forgiven, but I don't
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:50.260]   want this Christian life. I want to have a good time in London, and I want to go into
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:53.860]   this and that." My dear friend, you mustn't argue like that if you are a Christian. If
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.420]   you are a child of God, you are a member of the family. And what matters is the honour
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:04.100]   of the family, not what you want and like. There is no need to argue about these things.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:08.940]   These things operate as principles in human relationships. How much more so here, become
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:17.260]   imitators of God. And then we should be moved and animated by this motive, surely? The privilege
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:26.500]   of belonging to such a family. And finding ourselves in such a position, even while we
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:32.780]   are yet in this world as it is round and about us, with all its sin and its shame and its
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:39.420]   muddle and its agony, is there a greater privilege than being a Christian? I ask you. Can you
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.780]   now mention to me anything in this world this morning that is comparable to this? That you
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:49.820]   and I are children of God. That we belong to his family. We belong to the household
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:55.700]   of God. Here we are away from home. Our citizenship is in heaven. We belong there. He leaves us
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:00.260]   in this world of time for a while. And the world is antagonistic, it is hateful, it is
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:06.580]   sinful. Yes, but it is watching us. And we have been called out of that darkness. We
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.940]   have been taken out of the kingdom of Satan, translated into the kingdom of God's dear
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:18.500]   Son, adopted into the heavenly family, put into this royal household, though we are still
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:26.140]   in this world of sin and shame. Is there any honor in the world, I ask, that is comparable
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:32.740]   to that? Well, if you realize it, you will be careful about the way you walk. As you
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:37.740]   walk down the street, you will say to yourself, "I am a child of God. I belong to the royal
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.300]   family of heaven. And everybody is looking at me and watching me, and they are perfectly
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:46.500]   right in doing so. They will be judging God. They will be judging Christ by what they see
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.940]   in me." Very well, says Paul, "Be imitators of God. Walk down the street, if I may so
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:37:02.460]   put it, as God." Be imitators of God. Live in such a way that everybody looking at you
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:08.580]   will be made to think of God, because you are a child of God. Indeed, you remember our
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:13.780]   Lord put it Himself so clearly, a new commandment, He says, "I give unto you that ye love one
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:21.500]   another, so shall men know that ye are my disciples." By looking at you and seeing
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.220]   you loving one another, you will say, "What is this? We have never seen anything like
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:32.380]   this before. This can't happen amongst men as men. What is this?" And they will be driven
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:42.380]   to the only adequate explanation, "So shall men know that ye are my disciples." Or, as
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:47.700]   our Lord again put it in the Sermon on the Mount, "Let your light so shine before men
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:54.900]   that they may see your good works, but glorify your Father which is in heaven." In other
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:59.620]   words, the conduct of the child makes people think of the Father. They say, "Isn't he
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:04.220]   like his father? Doesn't he walk like him? Doesn't he behave like him?" You can't
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:08.860]   look at the child without thinking of the Father. Become imitators of God as children
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:14.500]   and beloved. Well, then, there are your reasons. But let me just ask a final question. How
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:20.220]   are we to do this? How are we to imitate God? The Apostle answers us. He tells us that we
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:30.300]   are to do it by walking in love. And walk in love, what does that mean? Well, it means
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:36.980]   that the whole of our conduct and behavior and conversation must be ordered in the realm
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:44.060]   and in the sphere of love. Again, there's no need to argue about this. If we are to
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:51.140]   be imitators of God and God is love, well, then we must walk in love. See, that's the
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:58.340]   inevitable logic of Christian truth. And what is this? Well, he's already hinted at it
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:03.260]   in the last verse of the previous chapter, "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted,
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:18.420]   loving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you." Become imitators
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:31.540]   of God. Do to others what God in Christ has done for you. What is this? Well, we had the
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:38.380]   exposition there in Matthew 5, in that section of the Sermon on the Mount, verses 43 to 48.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:43.580]   Here's our Lord's exposition of our text this morning. What are you and I to be like?
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.660]   Well, we are to order our conversation in love. What does that mean? "Be ye therefore
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:53.700]   perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." There it is, still more staggering.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:40:00.780]   Become imitators of God, says Paul. Our Lord says, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:08.700]   your Father which is in heaven is perfect." He says you should live in this way, that
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:14.420]   ye may be children of your Father which is in heaven. Well, how does he behave? Well,
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:20.860]   he behaves like this, he says, "He maketh his Son to rise on the evil and on the good,
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:27.580]   and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust." That's how God behaves. He doesn't confine
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:32.340]   his blessings to the good and the just. No, no, he gives them to the evil and the unjust
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:39.380]   also. Well, very well, what am I to do? Well, here it is, says Christ, "Love your enemies,
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:47.780]   bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:54.980]   use you and persecute you." In other words, you see, what he's teaching is that we must
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:41:01.420]   apply to others what God has done to us, and deal with others even though they're enemies,
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:06.020]   and are really dealing with us in a very cruel and most unjustifiable manner. We are to deal
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:14.420]   with them as God deals with his enemies, with the unjust and the vile and the evil. You
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:20.420]   see, in other words, what we are called upon to do as God's children beloved is this, to
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:25.820]   imitate God, and that means that we won't live an ordinary sort of life. Our life will
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:31.580]   be absolutely different. "If," says our Lord, "you love them which love you, what reward
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:37.380]   have you? Do not even the publicans the same." The publicans, you see, love those who love
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:41.260]   them. There's nothing clever about doing that. There's nothing extraordinary about that.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:46.620]   Even the publicans do it. And then he says, "If ye salute your brethren only, what do
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:54.580]   ye, more than others, do not even the publicans so?" There's nothing wonderful in all that.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:42:00.900]   That's the world's morality. "What do ye, more than others," says our Lord, which can
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:08.060]   be translated like this, "what is there special about that?" You see, our life is to be a
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:15.100]   very special one. You can't be a child of God without being a very special person, and
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:19.580]   your whole life will be unique and special. There's nothing ordinary about the Christian.
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:25.780]   He's extraordinary in every single respect, because he's a child of God, and he does things
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:30.340]   that nobody else can do. The publicans can't, these other people can't, he alone can. Our
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:39.780]   whole life is to be special. Because we are children of God, and so we put it finally,
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:49.100]   "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." "Ah, but you
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:54.100]   say he is in heaven and I am on earth. Can it be done on earth?" "It can," says Paul.
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:43:02.100]   Walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:08.100]   and a sacrifice to God as a sweet-smelling savour. I'm going on to that, God willing,
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.900]   next Sunday morning. It's one of the most glorious statements in the whole Bible. But
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:16.020]   here it is. Lest somebody might go out saying, "Ah, that's all right." It's very well to
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:21.380]   say, "Be ye perfect as your Father which is in heaven is perfect, but I'm walking the
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:26.740]   streets of this sinful world." It's all right. You've got a brother who's been in it, and
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:33.020]   he's walked the streets of this world. And that's how he walked in love. He gave himself
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:41.620]   for us an offering and a sacrifice. He gave his life, his body to be broken, his blood
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:51.380]   to be shed for his enemies, for sinners vile. And it went up to God as a sweet-smelling
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:58.540]   savour. And as you and I imitated God and imitated the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:04.620]   firstborn amongst many brethren, our lives and our activities will go up into the presence
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:16.500]   of God as a sweet-smelling savour. God will enjoy it. God's Father heart will swell with
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:29.500]   love and with pride as he sees his children imitating him in the sight of men. Become,
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:41.140]   therefore, imitators of God as children beloved. Amen.
