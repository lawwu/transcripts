[00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.440]   - Wait, bro, you keep your women's shit more private,
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.780]   but you rushed into a marriage, didn't you?
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.180]   - Yeah, I did.
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.060]   - Do you ever talk about that?
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.900]   My bad if you don't.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.820]   - No, no, I've spoken about it in the past.
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.820]   Like, you know, three months, four months of dating Paris
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.940]   for a Drake show, proposed, did the whole thing.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.480]   And I think I have so much, like, you know,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.960]   love and appreciation for how she was with me,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.680]   how much she helped me get to a place
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.420]   and see who I really am as a person
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.580]   and get me off that crazy train.
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.720]   And in reality, you know, I wasn't just grown up
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.180]   and adult enough to handle what comes with that.
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.220]   And I fucked it up and, you know, took years and years
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.340]   to be able to get to a place where, you know,
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.220]   we don't speak very often anymore,
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.060]   but it's nothing but love.
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.140]   I wish her the best.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.000]   I want her to be happy in life.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.680]   And like, it wasn't ever going to work out.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.820]   - How long was the marriage?
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.300]   - Maybe like a year and a half.
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.940]   But for me, like where I'm at now,
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.480]   are you not ready to get married?
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.900]   - I was married.
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.540]   - What?
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.160]   - Just, that marriage just ended recently.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.500]   - To the game or what?
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.480]   - That marriage just ended recently, dog.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.360]   - Yeah, bro, I'm at the point now--
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360]   - How do you give him some advice?
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.200]   He's going through it, bro.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.040]   - I mean, fuck, bro.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.640]   I'm at the point now where like, when I fall into love
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.240]   and I get into these relationships,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.020]   like the heartbreak of ending and who I turn into
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.280]   when it ends is like world ending for me
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280]   and world shattering, especially when I find somebody
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.500]   who is my best friend, who I do care about so much.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.240]   - That's the hardest part right there.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.500]   - And when it ends for me, I crumble.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.720]   Like I turn into a mute.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.280]   I hold myself up in my room for weeks and months at a time.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.660]   And I almost like lose in my brain, like how to even be myself
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.620]   or be a real person.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.920]   So like right now, it's very shaky thing for me
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.840]   and something that I want to steer clear from
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.500]   to the point where like, man, even when I'm on tour
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.380]   and you go to a party and there's 200 girls there
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.380]   and 30 or 40 of the boys, like I'm not interested
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.580]   really in the chase.
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.580]   Like, well, I've talked to some people here and there
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.940]   and like have a fun night every now and then.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.640]   But like, I'm not in that dog era, dog mentality anymore.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.940]   Like I want to be around my friends.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.140]   - How did he get over that?
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.940]   - Me and him got over it.
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.380]   - I mean, I think- - You got over it?
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.640]   - I think more than anything, I think more than anything, bro.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.140]   - You are the biggest capper ever.
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.340]   - It takes time, right?
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.440]   It takes time and like, you know, I really didn't get over it
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.860]   until I got around Drake and the boys and the crew,
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.620]   which for me, I have to go to a place where I know
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.100]   I'm the safest, I know I'm the happiest.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.640]   - How the fuck did that get you out of being a dog?
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.660]   - I mean, not necessarily.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.340]   Like I just, when you get into a relationship
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.260]   and you see what a vibe is with somebody
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.520]   and what the end goal of the game- - Oh, so being with Drake
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.720]   and then how does that make you want to be a dog anymore?
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.440]   - I mean, 'cause I just don't care to do it, bro.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.680]   When you catch a vibe with somebody
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.140]   and you're in a relationship with somebody
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.860]   and you see and have a future trip or a future vision
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.340]   of what you want your life to be
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.080]   and see a piece of yourself in the future.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.060]   Like, I think we all want kids eventually.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.660]   I think we all want family eventually.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.640]   You're not running.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.420]   You see these guys running around in the streets
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.240]   till they're 45, 50 years old.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.380]   That's not a life that looks enticing to me.
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.580]   - That part is scary.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.700]   So you obviously deal with heartbreaks tough.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.540]   Like you said, you hole up in the room.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.000]   How long does it take for you
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.920]   to like feel like a full like person?
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.800]   - Bro, this last one was the toughest one
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.100]   I've ever dealt with.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.800]   You know, still even having shutters
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.140]   and instances at times where I'm still dealing with it.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.280]   And you know, I think for me, like I said,
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.340]   I had to go to, I had to go sit at this high for five days
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.580]   and like sit in the places that I know to my core
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.960]   make me the happiest.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.260]   I had to go to Toronto and go to Drake's
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.100]   and to hang out and sit in the studio
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.560]   and listen to music and go to one of their parties
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.780]   where they're playing nothing but old Drake slappers
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.340]   and things that I would do when I was in my dorm room
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.180]   in college.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.180]   I have to call my sister every day.
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.180]   I have to call my mom and my dad and tap into my family
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.060]   and like really slowly find a way to try and get it,
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.100]   you know, out of my head.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.720]   And I think there's certain points in time
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.900]   where I have to go really hard drinking
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.940]   and fucking around to get my mind off it.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.180]   And slowly but surely as I'm around good people
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.860]   and I'm around the right people,
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.500]   my perspective starts to shift
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.360]   and I realize really deep down
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.660]   that as much as that did mean to me,
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.840]   there are other things in my world and in my life
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.560]   that have meant as much or more to me that like the music,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.060]   right, with Drake.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.560]   Like I would not go to sleep when an album would drop.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.020]   I would sit in my dorm room and memorize every word
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.900]   and write it down on a piece of paper
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.560]   until I knew every song of the whole album.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.680]   - Do you feel like--
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.520]   - Wait, how are you doing?
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.600]   Are you doing okay with your heartbreak?
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.120]   - Yeah, man.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.960]   - You okay?
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.800]   - I'm doing okay.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.640]   - How do you handle it?
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.680]   He goes to Drake's house, goes to the studio.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.100]   - I go to the gym, dog.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.180]   I go lift some weights.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.020]   - Yes, sir.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.860]   - Go get some shots up.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.780]   - On your end, you kick it.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.620]   - Hang out with my dog.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.460]   - Yes, sir.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.400]   - Kick it.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.940]   Do you, is the relationships ending
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.780]   because you are breaking up with this girl
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.880]   or she's catching you do some wild stuff and she's in?
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.540]   'Cause I feel like if you,
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.000]   if you break up with a girl,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.240]   that means you're pretty much over it.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.920]   But if she breaks up with you
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.580]   or catches you doing some wild stuff
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.920]   and she breaks up with you,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.940]   that's when it can be like tough.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.840]   - Oh, that's different.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.380]   If he breaks up with you, that's gotta hurt you.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.980]   - Are you in these relationships?
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.360]   - No, no, I'm really not.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.740]   I haven't been very much of the past
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.900]   of like an ender of the relationship very much.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.600]   Like when I go after somebody
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.260]   and I get in a relationship with somebody,
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.820]   like I'm in it for the long haul
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.760]   and it's what I want and I know it's what I want.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.180]   But like, you know, I think for me in my life,
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.360]   throughout times, like especially last year,
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.400]   like, you know, as I'm getting back into the public eye
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.020]   and I'm doing the podcast and I'm doing more interviews
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.700]   and the Netflix stuff and everything I've done,
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.220]   you know, it brings a lot of daily interaction
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.540]   with certain people that are usually all positive.
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.580]   But for sometimes for me, like I look back on everything
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.040]   with an immense amount of like shame and like, damn,
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.580]   I'm sitting there on Sundays watching Lamar
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.160]   and like all these guys that I've played with
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.460]   and against and stuff and I'm seeing what could have been
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.240]   if I would have been in a different place.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.540]   So I think for me, like last year, like I think I just ride
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.200]   through a wave of depression at times.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.120]   And when that wave comes, I'm not myself.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.000]   Like I'm not the fun flowing, energy filled, talk shit,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.700]   have fun kind of guy.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.760]   And it puts me in a little bit of a hole.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.320]   And for me, that comes with sitting on the couch,
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.440]   staying at home more, don't really want to leave
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.760]   or go out or go to dinner.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.860]   And like, you know, this relaxed relationship,
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.940]   I was the happiest I could have ever been
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.860]   just being with her and vibing at the house
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.060]   or just doing things solo one-on-one.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.480]   - Why'd she break up with you?
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.520]   - I mean, because I feel like I was just,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.680]   I wasn't myself, right?
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.760]   I wasn't taking care of the relationship
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.480]   the way that I should, wasn't taking care of myself
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.600]   the way that I should.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.740]   - Don't you feel like a good woman
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.120]   when you're in those places of like not being yourself,
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.160]   they should be able to see that
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.380]   and try to help you work through that.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.920]   - And that's a lot of it too, right?
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.620]   I think it got to a point where she was like,
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.400]   yo, I'm giving you everything I have.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.100]   I'm giving you unconditional love.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.040]   I'm giving you everything that I possibly can,
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.900]   chances and chances to try and like, yo, snap out of this,
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.400]   be yourself, be the person that I fell in love with.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.560]   And for me, it was just like really stuck.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.800]   And like, you know,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.840]   my mind and energy and effort was like all focused on it.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.600]   I'm aware that it's going on,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.740]   but like I couldn't get myself out of it.
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.180]   And, you know, tough man, tough.
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.360]   You know, this is a person I definitely saw and envisioned
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.780]   spending a lot in the rest of my life with.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.640]   And, you know, I look back at it now
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.400]   and it's taken me a lot of time and perspective shift
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.100]   to just be like, you know what?
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.340]   At the end of the day.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.980]   You could call me five years down the road and be like, yo, I miss you.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.980]   I love you.
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.340]   Let's try and make this work again.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.120]   And I would drop everything in my life for everything that I was doing to be able to do that.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.340]   Tell her you're in a better place.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.340]   You might as well.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.220]   I mean, bro, I want her to be happy, right?
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.820]   And whatever she's doing in her life and whatever she's doing,
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.880]   I wish the best for her.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.120]   If it's happy with somebody else or happy being on her own or whatever it is,
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.580]   like I'll always be there in any way that I can be and doing whatever I can be.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:08.680]   But, you know, I don't want to sit and squeeze my way into a situation
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.080]   or try and make things messy because, you know, if it's meant to be, it'll come back, right?
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.360]   If it's not, it's the most love for me ever.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.260]   And I don't think I handled things the right way whenever things ended.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.180]   I think I really pressed and tried to make it work and, like, you know,
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:29.360]   just kind of lost my marbles a little bit to the point of where I would have done anything to make it work.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.840]   And maybe it wasn't meant to be at that time.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.080]   So, you know, for now, I have other things to focus on
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.540]   and other things to try and do to keep my mind off it
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.880]   and to just try and just keep going.
