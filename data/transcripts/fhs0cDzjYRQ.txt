[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:13.480]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.040]   You have questions, we have answers,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.320]   we have experts, we have me and Duncan.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.240]   Ask the Compound show at gmail.com is the email.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.680]   Today's show is sponsored by our friends at Bird Dogs.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.000]   Duncan, I have a family trip planned for tomorrow.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.400]   We're going up to beautiful Mackinac Island,
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.360]   kind of an annual tradition for us now.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.640]   You have to take a ferry to the island
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.640]   and there's no cars on the island.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.480]   Right? - Sounds nice.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.300]   - It's on a horse and carriage,
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.140]   but there's also a lot of bikes.
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.400]   You bike around, it's pretty beautiful.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.920]   You go all the way around the outside of the island.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.180]   But I have to figure out what I'm wearing, right?
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.480]   I'm checking the weather.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.800]   And so I'm packing last night and guess what I packed?
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.840]   All Bird Dogs for my lower half.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.680]   Bird Dog shorts, Bird Dog pants.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.060]   And because I'm thinking I'm gonna be on a bike,
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.240]   I'm gonna be a little active.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.560]   But then I also have to dress nice
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.640]   because my mother's birthday is this weekend.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.660]   So we're going out to a nice dinner.
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.760]   So I have the nice seersucker ones, right?
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.880]   Then of course, when I'm on the bike,
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.120]   I don't wanna be uncomfortable
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.680]   and have the George Costanza with a wallet
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.520]   that I'm sitting on.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.960]   So the wallet's on the side.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.480]   So Bird Dogs has me hooked up.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.320]   I have a full suitcase, full of them.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.080]   I'm ready to go to be biking, walking,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.720]   versatile, but stylish, right?
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.160]   So if you go to birddogs.com/atc
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.120]   for ask the compound, obviously.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.360]   Get yourself one of these free tumblers,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.320]   Bird Dog tumblers, right?
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.200]   Pretty nice.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.920]   - You know what I did in my Bird Dogs other day?
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.280]   Some shorts.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.640]   Went for a run.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.480]   They were great.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.880]   - I've been working out of them this summer too.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.760]   It is, it's nice.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.120]   It's breathable, it's stretchy, right?
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.600]   It's very nice.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.440]   Birddogs.com/atc.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.520]   All right, a lot of questions today.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.640]   Let's do it.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.960]   - Okay, so first up,
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.000]   we have the following.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.720]   Can you guys speak to if you think the market
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.200]   is skewed towards benefiting the large players
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.600]   more than the small players,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.360]   if not being downright rigged against the small players?
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.280]   - Get this question a lot.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.560]   So they're pulling up here.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.720]   There was a movie coming out this fall
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.280]   about the GameStop saga.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.780]   Seems like it happened pretty quick.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.620]   They pulled it together.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.520]   It's called "Dumb Money."
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.440]   I watched the trailer.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.280]   It actually looks pretty good, I think.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.680]   - Yeah, I thought it looked good, yeah.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.160]   - So, and they have like a pretty good cast.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.800]   So Seth Rogen plays Gabe Plotkin,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.360]   the guy who shorted GameStop.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.200]   It's kind of funny.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.240]   In the past, he definitely would have been
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.300]   on the other side of this,
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.200]   but now he's playing the man.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.120]   Paul Dano is Roaring Kitty.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   Remember that guy, the YouTube guy who bought GameStop.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.200]   Pete Davidson is his brother.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.320]   I don't know if he actually had a brother.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.200]   They made it up for the movie.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.520]   Shanley Woodley is his wife.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.040]   Nick Offerman is playing Ken Griffin,
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.380]   which I never really would have thought,
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.600]   but based on the trailer,
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.920]   the premise here is the stock market
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.480]   is rigged against the little guy
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.560]   and in favor of the big whales,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.240]   like hedge fund managers like Ken Griffin
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.120]   and Steve Cohen and Gabe Plotkin.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.700]   Vincent D'Onofrio as Steve Cohen.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.080]   That was interesting, too.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.120]   But this is the story, a heartwarming tale,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.440]   about the little guy finally taking down the big guy, right?
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.660]   David beat Goliath.
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.440]   And I'm sure the movie would be fine,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.000]   if not a little bit embellished,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.360]   because it's the same guy who wrote the movie,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.880]   or the book that the Social Network was based on.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.940]   It's called The Accident of Millionaires,
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.900]   that Ben Mezrich guy.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.160]   Pretty good books, actually.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.760]   They're a little embellished.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.800]   So the problem is,
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.000]   Goliath is still doing pretty well these days.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.880]   I saw the following headline just last month on CNBC.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.640]   Michael Jordan is selling his stake
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.480]   in the Charlotte Hornets.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.280]   He's probably gonna bet it all on the golf course,
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.120]   and Blackjack Tables, I think he spent $275 million for it,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.280]   and he made $3 billion or something.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.760]   So I look in the fine print down there,
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.680]   and wait, who's buying his stake from him?
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.900]   Gabe Plotkin is poised to become a majority owner,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.640]   pending league approval.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.320]   So the guy who got taken down by the GameStop,
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.480]   Reddit people, is literally gonna be an NBA owner.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.000]   He's probably still worth hundreds of millions,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.460]   or maybe a billion dollars.
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.980]   They did force him into shutting his hedge fund down,
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.500]   but it does feel like one of those,
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.480]   oh wait, the guy lost a bunch of money on GameStop,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.480]   but he got to keep all the fees that he already made
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.000]   from his two and 20 hedge fund,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.960]   and they didn't get clawed back.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.440]   So it does feel a little bit like,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.900]   heads I win, tails you lose type of situation.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.040]   Even though in this situation, the little guy won,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.240]   the big guy still won.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.200]   They're fine.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.840]   I'm not sure that's gonna make it into the movie.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.040]   That probably wouldn't help with the story,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.760]   but it does kind of feel like the market is stacked
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   against little guys in some ways.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.340]   So there are some ways it is, right?
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.440]   So you're never gonna, as a little guy,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.280]   and I'm using this as just regular normal,
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.660]   I'm a little guy too, right?
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.800]   - Right.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.640]   - Literally--
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.460]   - I'm definitely a little guy,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.460]   and a much smaller guy after my 25% loss in early today.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.920]   - Tough break for you, Duncan.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   You're in a bull market too.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.200]   So the things of being a little,
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.520]   you're never gonna get the sweetheart deals
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.440]   like Warren Buffett got in the financial crisis
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.240]   with the Goldman Sachs and Bank of America deals.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.960]   You're not gonna be able to invest in the best hedge funds
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.480]   or venture capital deals or private equity deals.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.200]   You're not gonna be able to get two and 20
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.640]   and keep that 20,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.200]   even if you lose half of your investor's money.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.600]   If you try to take on Ken Griffin
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.080]   in the high-frequency trading,
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.640]   no matter which way your position goes,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.320]   you could lose 25% notely, or you could make 25%.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.080]   Ken Griffin's probably gonna make money either way.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.560]   So in that sense, it does feel like
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.180]   the markets are stacked against the little guys.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.840]   - We couldn't even buy the Constitution, you know?
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.680]   You had to come in and sweep in and take that, buy that.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.520]   - I forgot about that, yeah.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.640]   - You couldn't let the little guys have one win.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.040]   - It feels like the big guys win all the time.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.220]   But in other ways, the individual investor
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.400]   has all sorts of advantages over Wall Street, right?
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.640]   You get to invest in index funds, if you want to,
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.060]   with low fees that basically guarantees
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.360]   that you're gonna outperform 75 to 90%
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.640]   of professional investors in the stock market.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.880]   You can ignore short-term performance numbers if you want.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.640]   When I worked in the endowment industry,
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.960]   these funds, foundations and endowments,
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.740]   were set up, in most cases, in perpetuity.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.020]   They wanted to last forever and leave a legacy.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.640]   So their time horizons were measured
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.440]   in multiples of decades,
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.400]   yet they obsessed over monthly
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.360]   and quarterly performance numbers, right?
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.400]   As an individual investor,
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.720]   you don't have to have some made-up benchmark
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.680]   that you have to try to beat every month.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.520]   Your only benchmark that matters is,
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.920]   are you on track to achieving your financial goals, right?
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.320]   There's no investment committees to answer to.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   There's no outside investors
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.160]   that are breathing down your neck
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.380]   because you underperformed for a quarter or two.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.880]   There's no alumni or donors
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.640]   that are forcing you to make investments
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.080]   in managers that they roomed with in college
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.640]   because they want to keep things on the up and up.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.080]   So you can set it and forget it
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.320]   and ignore macro predictions
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.120]   and stop looking at your statements if you want to, right?
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.120]   Professional big guys cannot do that.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.280]   So I think probably the biggest advantage you have
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.720]   is just keeping a long time horizon.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.700]   So I use this in some of my presentations.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.880]   My time horizon, on a daily basis,
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.960]   the market is up a little bit more than it's down.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.920]   56% of all days, the stock market is up.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.120]   44% it's down.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.280]   But if you extend your time horizon
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.040]   one, five, 10, 20, 30, 40 years,
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.360]   you know, the probability of seeing a gain goes up.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.840]   And I love this chart because it shows
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.080]   that like Wall Street wants to play
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.400]   in the short-term sandbox.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.040]   You have the ability to play in the long-term sandbox.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.880]   Right?
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.560]   So I just, I think that's your advantage
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.480]   as the little guy in the markets.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.640]   If you try to play the short-term game of Wall Street,
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.400]   unless you get lucky,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.160]   let's be honest, the Roaring Kitty guy got lucky.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.860]   He made a great pitch on this stock, but he got lucky.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.600]   Throw up the chart here.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.420]   GameStop? - Well, that's the thing
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.920]   about Roaring Kitty that I actually always found interesting
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.860]   is if you look, he was much more nuanced.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.360]   Like his initial reason that he was buying a stock
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.160]   was like based on fundamentals and things.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.000]   - Yes, it wasn't a meme stock thing.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.120]   - He did a bunch of research.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.000]   He wasn't just like, I randomly picked a company, you know.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.240]   - The funny, so throw up the chart.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.760]   The funny thing is since pre-pandemic days,
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.600]   even though it's down 75% from the highs
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.560]   of a meme stock mania,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.740]   it's still up like 1400% since the start of the pandemic.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.600]   So it's still, I think he took a bunch of chips
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.440]   off the table.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.260]   I hope he did.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.340]   So anyways, in some ways,
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.200]   like the market's always gonna seem unfair
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.860]   and biased towards billionaires
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.340]   who seemingly win no matter what.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.540]   But I think that's just certain areas of life
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.880]   that's always going to happen.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.260]   But in other ways, I really do think
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.300]   that the little investor has the upper hand
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.980]   because you have the ability to invest in strategies
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.900]   and not pay two and 20 and be more tax efficient
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.620]   and not trade short-term all the time if you don't want to.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.500]   So I still think that you have an upper hand
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.260]   if you're willing and able to use it.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.460]   If you try to play the short-term game,
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.960]   they're probably going to beat you
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.160]   either through taking your fee,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.740]   either through taxes or some other way.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.320]   But over the long-term,
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.280]   if you're willing and able to play the long game,
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.040]   that's where Wall Street has a hard time
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.920]   sticking with that type of strategy.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.760]   - Right.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.140]   I feel like it's also gotten fair
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.540]   for the little guy with free trading, right?
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.100]   I mean, imagine back in the day,
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.200]   like I remember when I was first buying stocks
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.260]   back in college,
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.280]   I was paying like $8 to buy like one share
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.300]   of Microsoft or something.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.960]   It's like, that's stupid.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.480]   - You can buy fractional shares now.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   You can put anything you want in the market now.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   - The barriers for entry are way smaller now
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.520]   than they would have been in the past.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.400]   So in that way, it's not really stacked.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.900]   I think things have gotten appreciably better
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.720]   for the individual investor over the last 20 years
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.320]   than they have for the professional investor.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.160]   That's for sure.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.000]   - Right.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.160]   And also when a retail person goes up 80%
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.680]   on their small account,
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.840]   they're not like buying a Ferrari.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.520]   But like Ken Griffin can buy a Ferrari with his winnings.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.280]   And so I think it's more like ostentatious and showy.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.320]   I think that's what people hate
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.120]   is they just see these people
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.480]   that they see as like Wall Street succeeding
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.200]   and doing really well.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.040]   - Yes.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.880]   - And even if they do well, it's not gonna compare, right?
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.400]   Because the scale is so different.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.240]   - Yes.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.800]   Which unfortunately is probably always gonna be the case.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.640]   - Right.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.480]   - Right.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.300]   Let's do another one.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.140]   - Okay.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.840]   Up next we have a question from George.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.940]   How do you know- - Great name.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.960]   - Yeah.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.480]   - It's my son's name.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.480]   - Oh, right.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.400]   And my favorite Beatle.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.240]   Okay.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.080]   How do you know when US government bonds are cheap?
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.040]   I bought some during the US debt ceiling brinksmanship
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.880]   or brinkmanship.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.080]   I haven't heard that word.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.160]   I think it was a good time to buy when others were fearful,
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.880]   but they have gone down more.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.400]   Also, I noticed on Fred that from 1871 to 1932,
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.760]   US stocks were flat.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.360]   Same with the German market from 1872 to 1913.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.640]   And of course, Japan since 1990.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.280]   I think I've been lucky but foolish
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.400]   the last 41 years being 100% stocks.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.000]   Thoughts?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.840]   - This is a loaded question.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.240]   A lot to go on here.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.120]   Lots to unpack here, as I say on podcasts.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.880]   - Yeah, I feel like he's subtweeting you a little bit
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.940]   because you've said a lot about long-term horizons
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.960]   and things being good,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.680]   but he's showing us a 41 and 61 year horizon that-
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.440]   - You don't think I came prepared here, Duncan?
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.280]   Come on.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.720]   So the first one is fairly simple.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.720]   No one knows except at the extremes.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.640]   So I wrote a post in March 2020 saying,
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.720]   I was way more worried about bonds than stocks,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.560]   but that was pretty easy
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.040]   because rates were zero to 1% for treasuries.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.240]   That was pretty simple, right?
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.340]   I didn't know how it was gonna play out,
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.440]   but you knew that things in bonds,
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.720]   the outcomes weren't gonna be that great, right?
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.600]   Look at that.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.440]   Timestamp.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.480]   I didn't know that they were gonna go
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.360]   from 0% to 5% in a year,
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.540]   but you knew it was unhealthy.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.760]   I guess my problem with this question
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.120]   is that you're trying to play the bond market
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.280]   in the short term.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.880]   And bond market, it's way easier
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.240]   to predict the bond market in the long term
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.240]   because you take your starting yield,
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.900]   especially in government bonds,
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.900]   and that'll get you something like 95% of the way there
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.860]   for long-term returns, call it five, seven, 10 years.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.700]   But in the short run,
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.140]   you're dealing with changes in interest rates
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.220]   and inflation and GDP growth and Fed policy
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.540]   and expectations and all this stuff.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.420]   Unless you're a hedge fund manager,
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.580]   I would not think of bonds being cheap or expensive,
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.780]   especially if you're buying them for the yields now
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.860]   where you're getting five or 6% or whatever it is.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.700]   I wouldn't worry much about the short-term fluctuations
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.820]   'cause the yield is gonna win out over the long-term.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.180]   I think bonds are for patient people.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.180]   Bonds are not for like, are they cheap or expensive?
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.820]   I'm gonna be greedy even though there's a fear for whatever.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.700]   Like that doesn't work as well in the bond market
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.580]   as it does in the stock market.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.180]   For the second question,
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.860]   I will summarize what he said here in a few short words.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.020]   Stocks are risky, right?
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.500]   I'm not surprised at all that US stocks went nowhere
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.580]   from whatever, 1871 to 1932,
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.380]   because the year ending 1932,
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.260]   the stock market had fallen 85% from the highs in 1929,
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.100]   right?
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.380]   That's pretty, it had to be down after that, right?
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.620]   And there's plenty of periods
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.080]   where the US stock market has gone nowhere.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.060]   We talked about the lost decade a couple of weeks ago,
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.220]   but from the start of 1998 through February of 2009,
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.420]   the S&P 500 had a total return
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.260]   with dividends invested of negative 9%.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.740]   So that's like 11 years and change where stocks went nowhere.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.740]   All your returns back to 1998 were gone, right?
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.580]   That's pretty recent.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.140]   The total return for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.140]   since the start of 2008 through this year is up just 28%.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.220]   Essentially a lost decade and a half.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.140]   S&P is up 330% by comparison, just so you know.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.140]   So you don't earn the risk premium without the risk, right?
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.460]   I do wanna mention something about the Japan situation
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.620]   because it always irks me.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.480]   Every time I post a stat about buying hold
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.840]   or stocks for the long run,
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.540]   someone always shows up looking like Leonardo DiCaprio,
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.220]   like this, scratching their chin saying,
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.180]   "Now show Japan, I got you, I'm so clever."
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.020]   Right?
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.620]   I wanna debunk this.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.780]   MSCI Japan Index, 1990 to today is up 40% in total,
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.740]   1% per year.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.580]   So three decades and change where you lost out to T-bills.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.540]   I think T-bills were up 2.5% per year over that time.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.300]   So Japanese stock investors underperformed
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.340]   over three decades.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.100]   And people say, "See, stocks for long and ha, ha, ha."
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.320]   But is it a myth, right?
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.040]   These are the total returns from 1970 to 1989
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.260]   for the MSCI Japan Index.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:14.260]   6,000% total returns, 22.9% annual returns for two decades.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.980]   $10,000 in 1970 invested in Japanese stocks
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.300]   is worth $616,000 by 1989.
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.620]   Easily, I think the biggest financial asset bubble
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.460]   in history.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.740]   We can mash these two together.
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.420]   - Do you have those numbers in yen though?
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.780]   Can we have those in yen?
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.380]   - I did not do the currency calculation, sorry.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.660]   I'm pretending we're hedged here.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.680]   If we go from 1970 to today,
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.760]   we're talking an 8,600% total return or 8.7% per year.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.780]   Guess what stocks for the long run in Japan worked?
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.220]   You just had to go really long, right?
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.140]   And the reason that stock returns have been so awful there
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.860]   from 1990 is 'cause they were so unbelievable
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.300]   and you pulled forward all those returns
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.700]   and the P/E ratio got to 150 or whatever it was, or 100,
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.100]   and the bubble just ate up all the future returns.
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.700]   And so you had this period of 30 years
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.200]   where you had to work off that bubble.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.180]   The long, long returns are still pretty darn good,
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.360]   almost 9% per year in Japan, right?
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.180]   Stocks for the long run worked there.
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.420]   It just depended on when you started.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.440]   Now, back to the question at hand.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.500]   If you've been investing for 40 years, as George said,
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.100]   and portfolio has been 100% in stocks,
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.500]   he's done pretty well for himself, right?
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.780]   In the 40 years leading up to 2022,
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.820]   this doesn't even include this year
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.660]   where we've got a snapback.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.860]   The S&P 500 was up 11.1% per year.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.420]   MSCI World XUS was up 9% per year.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.220]   So whether it was lucky or foolish or whatever
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.960]   for keeping all your money in stocks,
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.500]   at this point, you probably won the game
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.220]   and it makes sense to diversify your portfolio.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.920]   That could be as simple as holding some cash,
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.420]   maybe some short-term bonds,
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.260]   just to see you through a few years worth of spending.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.140]   You could obviously hold some other asset classes
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.460]   or strategy, but the whole point is
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.280]   you've picked out these periods where you see
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.500]   the stock market can be very risky.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.020]   And I'm not here to pretend that I know
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.300]   if or when that's gonna happen again,
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.580]   but the whole point of diversification,
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.700]   especially when you're retired,
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.060]   is to avoid bad things happening
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.300]   at the worst possible moment.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.900]   And history has shown that bad things can
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.060]   and will happen in the stock market on occasion.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:05.980]   That's why you diversify
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.860]   and hold some other sort of asset class
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.660]   or something to see you through
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.540]   if you happen to be unlucky enough
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.820]   to live through one of those periods.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.340]   - Yeah, yeah, well, and like they point out,
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.380]   the market was all over the place throughout that time.
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.980]   So that was a very, very cherry-picked,
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.260]   as you guys say, but fair, fair for them to point out.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.020]   But yeah, it all happens, right,
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.780]   on when you would have been retiring,
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.420]   when you would have been withdrawing.
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.340]   And yeah, scary still to think about.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.700]   But yeah, that's why you diversify.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.700]   - Give a shout out to Duncan's mom in the chat again.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.540]   Pam, welcome.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.180]   And all the other regulars, we always appreciate it.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.500]   Everyone likes your new hat today, Duncan.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.660]   I didn't know we had more new hats.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.180]   - This is a one-of-one.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.140]   It didn't come out quite how we were wanting, so.
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.380]   - Oh, okay.
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.420]   So you're kind of like the team
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.420]   that lost in the NBA finals
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.100]   when they sent the shirts to Africa.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.060]   - Right, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.620]   We do have a new teacap hat, though.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.700]   It's a black hat with the full-color stitching.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.380]   So that's the one you can actually pick up.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.220]   - All right, next one.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.420]   - Okay, next one.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.940]   I'm gonna omit the name here
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.540]   just because of the nature of the question.
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.700]   But we've gotten questions from them before,
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.300]   so thanks for writing in again.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.020]   I'm 33 years old and have accumulated $1 million of SPY.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.820]   I can live a modest life on $40,000 a year
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.140]   here in Lithuania.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.020]   I've almost paid off my mortgage and have no other debt.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.060]   Thinking about the 4% rule, can I retire?
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.140]   I'm not saying I will, but is this an option?
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:30.980]   - I'm impressed.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.820]   This is the not-to-brag-of-the-day, obviously.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.100]   - I was just asking myself this question the other day,
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.660]   you know, I was just wondering.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.860]   - So $1 million in an S&P 500 ETF.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.700]   We don't know what else they have,
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.540]   but this is impressive.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.860]   So I could run all the numbers
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.580]   on the 4% rule that you want.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.360]   And if you wanna search 4% rule on my blog, you can.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.620]   I've written about it a number of times.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.620]   But I think this idea goes beyond the idea of investing.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.460]   Obviously, the returns and stuff are gonna be important,
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.500]   but I think a lot of it is also the financial planning
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.620]   aspect of retiring early.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.680]   And there's a lot more boxes you have to check off
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.740]   if you're gonna retire early at that age,
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.540]   at 40, than otherwise.
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.540]   So let's bring a financial advisor into the chat here.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.640]   Nick Sapienza, who is an excellent financial advisor
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.900]   for us at Riddles. - Hey, Nick.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.300]   - Representing Bayou down in Louisiana for us.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.620]   - Yep.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.460]   - Nick, there's obviously all sorts of different things
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.800]   you have to think through when you retire,
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.980]   but I think the calculus is a lot different
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.620]   if you're going from age 60, 65, 70, versus age 40, right?
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.220]   So what are some of the other,
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.420]   if you're a financial advisor and someone sits you down
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.300]   and says, "Here's the pile of money I have.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.820]   "Here's kind of how much I spend."
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.820]   And it just so happens that this person can live
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.760]   on the 4% out of the million dollars.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.500]   What are your thought process
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.780]   when you're having the conversation with someone
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.620]   where they basically say,
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.980]   "Am I gonna be okay if I do this?
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.000]   "If I take this leap, what do you think?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.380]   "Can I do it?"
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:56.380]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna go through the trade-offs first
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.700]   and some of the things that he might not be thinking about.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.540]   But first, I just wanna start off with some context
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.540]   about the 4% rule and it'll kind of lead into this.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.460]   So it kind of starts off with a story.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.460]   The 4% rule is an assumed withdrawal rate
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.340]   that should survive the worst possible 30-year period
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.540]   of market conditions.
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.980]   I think that's what a lot of people don't realize
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.420]   when the first study was done to show
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.100]   what's the floor here, not the average situation,
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.540]   but the 4% was used as this would allow you
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.940]   to see through the 1930s or whatever,
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.020]   whatever the worst possible, like we talked about earlier.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.700]   That's what it can see you through.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.540]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.220]   The example that Kitsis uses,
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.300]   so I go to basically Kitsis for a lot of research
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.940]   on the 4% rule or the 3.5% rule or the 3% rule,
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:39.880]   which will kind of tie into this.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.700]   But if you think about that,
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.180]   whether or not you wanna trust the data
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.140]   from this time period, you can say the world is different,
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.300]   but he uses the 1890s as an example, as a starting point.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.900]   In that 30-year period,
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.380]   there's a lot of differences in the world today,
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.520]   but maybe human nature is a constant.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.500]   There were two financial panics, a severe depression,
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.220]   the assassination of a president, the Spanish flu,
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.040]   the entirety of World War I.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.580]   And at the same time, we had no central bank.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.300]   We were still backed by the gold standard.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.860]   So less stability, more volatility, more bank runs.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.540]   You can read more from Jamie Catherwood on that.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.620]   It's a pretty fascinating topic.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.440]   But regardless, the 4% rule still worked
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.860]   in the most severe economic and financial times.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.220]   The average rate of return on that time period
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.020]   was actually like 4.7%.
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.520]   So yes, technically 4.7 versus four, the rule will still work
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.260]   but there's an extremely high possibility for failure.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.380]   And when you go more into the data,
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.820]   like for in this guy's case, he's 33 years old.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.300]   He has an extremely long runway.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.500]   As Paul Zoettner likes to say,
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.980]   more people die on the way down from Everest
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:46.820]   than on the way up.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.620]   And I think he stole that from "Into Thin Air,"
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.380]   but the same is true.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.420]   Like he's got one skillset for accumulation
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.740]   and it's a different skillset for decumulation,
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.220]   especially when it comes to
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.280]   how diversified his portfolio is.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.780]   So what matters above-
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.780]   - The funny thing too that I like about this example
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.260]   is I've done examples on my website
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.300]   where I talk about if you had a million dollars
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.820]   in the stock market, would it work?
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.700]   And most people don't actually have that.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.900]   This person actually does literally have a million dollars
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.820]   in the S&P 500.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.540]   So the diversification- - He's the textbook example.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.900]   - Yeah, the diversification piece
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.980]   obviously kind of worries me here
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.340]   that maybe you want to have some more diversification.
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.460]   But the other piece is if you try out 40,
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.860]   the 4% rule is looking at like 30 year time periods, right?
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.420]   You may have to let this last, you know,
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.980]   50, 60, 70 years potentially.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.580]   So I think that's what we have to think about
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.420]   is the time.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.700]   - Just imagine if they were leveraged,
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.060]   you know what I mean? - Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.900]   - I mean, well, to use a more relevant,
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.860]   a more recent example, you can look at .com.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.300]   Like if you retired at the peak of the market in 2000,
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.620]   which is everyone's greatest fear, right?
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.020]   You would have, in his case,
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.260]   you would have run out of money following the 4% rule
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.140]   in I think like 15 years.
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.780]   So mistakes compound, right?
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.940]   There's no, the savings spigot is turned off.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.180]   There's no additional shot.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.180]   There's no extra time to recoup.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.540]   It's, he's basically effectively like in 2000, 2003,
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.100]   he might've even doubled his withdrawal rate.
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.100]   So having 100% of your money.
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.260]   - If you're selling when stocks are crashing
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.740]   and you're keeping your amount of spending
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.580]   just as high, you're right.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.580]   You could easily spend all your money.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.740]   I think that's the biggest thing here is that
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.380]   this is why I think the financial planning aspect
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.940]   is so important because
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.740]   you have to be very flexible, I think.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.180]   And so if it's a really bad year
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.780]   or a bad stretch in the markets,
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.980]   you may have to rein it in a little bit
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.620]   and dial down your spending.
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.660]   And maybe when things are up
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.300]   and you have a great bull market,
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.940]   then you can go back a little bit.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.300]   That's hard for people to do, I'm sure though,
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.260]   is have volatility in their spending,
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.380]   just like in the markets.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.700]   - And look, people will make adjustments,
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.620]   but to cut to the chase,
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.020]   like, which is to the point that you're getting at,
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.340]   the earlier you retire,
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.820]   the lower that withdrawal rate needs to be
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.100]   just to give you more flexibility.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.060]   So in his case, like he's really towing the line,
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.660]   a million dollars, 4% rule,
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.380]   can live on $40,000 a year,
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.620]   but we're not accounting for taxes.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.500]   I don't know if Lithuania,
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.220]   I think they have like some sort of
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.740]   social security system in place,
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.260]   or maybe some sort of pension benefit,
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.300]   or maybe it's just for elder care
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.780]   and you're below the poverty level,
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.020]   not a person nailed down on that.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.980]   But the bottom line is like,
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.140]   he has such an extremely long runway.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.980]   There's two things,
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.060]   and Kitsis highlights this pretty well.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.460]   Like there's a, maybe a 10% chance
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.180]   that he retires and he's not prepared,
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.020]   and he doesn't make any adjustments,
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.580]   and he retires into a secular bear market.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.020]   Okay, and his sequence of returns,
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.780]   like the order in which he got that bear market,
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.260]   it's not a matter of if he's gonna experience
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.180]   a bear market, it's just a matter of when,
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.980]   or a period of like flat returns
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.780]   or sideways markets, it's when.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.900]   And if he front loads that,
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.780]   that's an extreme disadvantage for him,
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.780]   so he has to make adjustments.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.660]   So the key takeaway to answer this question
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.620]   is that he needs to start off with possibly,
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.620]   like he can do it.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.620]   It's not a matter of if he can,
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.220]   it's a matter of how.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.980]   Start off with like a 3% withdrawal rate,
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.460]   have a higher cash buffer,
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.180]   but also part-time work.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.220]   Like I like the idea,
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.100]   I'm not big on the idea of fire,
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.500]   lean fire, fat fire,
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.340]   but coast fire is kind of a new one,
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.460]   and that's where you would basically--
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.300]   - I've never heard of this,
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.140]   what does that mean?
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.500]   - So you retire,
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.700]   you have a job that you don't necessarily like,
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.500]   you're not gonna do it forever.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.340]   It's not, you know,
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.500]   it's just a means to an end.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.060]   You retire early,
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.660]   but then you go and you like start a vegetable garden,
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.500]   sell it out at a farmer's market--
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.420]   - Kind of like how all the fire people
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.340]   just start a blog and live off the blog.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.620]   - Exactly.
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.460]   Exactly right.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.300]   - The other thing is,
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.780]   this person has accumulated a million dollars
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.620]   in 33-- - It's impressive.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.500]   - At 33, and if they're talking about retiring at 40,
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.940]   they still have some time to save and invest
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.420]   and maybe grow that nest egg a little larger as well.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.260]   I think that-- - Yeah.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.180]   - So they obviously have very good financial habits.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.020]   - Yeah.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.020]   - But yeah, kudos to them anyway.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:37.860]   - Dynando's one,
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.860]   Dynando's chart,
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.860]   I didn't hear it referenced specifically.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.700]   - Yeah, chart on,
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.500]   there we go. - I got this, yeah.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.900]   - Growth of a million dollars in retirement,
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.700]   so this is breaking down the fact
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.140]   that he has a 10% chance of running out of money,
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.700]   and this is over a 45 year,
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.040]   or I'm sorry, 50 year time horizon,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.660]   so I think he's even a little further out,
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.180]   but a 10% chance that he runs out of money,
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.940]   but there's an equal chance that he ends up
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.900]   with 9.3 times what he started with,
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.900]   so he ends up with $9.3,
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.140]   and so you have to manage that upside risk too
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.580]   of all this money unspent
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.940]   and kind of towing it too close to the line.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.740]   So in his case, that dynamic withdrawal strategy
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.660]   is a fancy way to say that you just make adjustments
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.300]   every year or maybe even every quarter.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.860]   If the markets are up,
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.460]   you can maybe spend a little bit more
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.420]   or save a little bit more,
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.340]   put a little extra pay in the barn.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.020]   If markets are down, you cut back,
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.460]   and ideally you cut back permanently.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.420]   I don't like the psychology behind that
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.260]   of kind of your lifestyle ebbs and flows with the market,
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.380]   but that seems to be a reasonable adjustment
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.740]   to make an alternative
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.060]   that I've done with some clients as well
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.060]   is you look at the balance.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.220]   This is a guardrail strategy,
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.100]   so you look at the balance at the end of the year,
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.200]   beginning of the year.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.100]   What can we spend?
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.580]   What's sort of the ceiling and the floor?
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.780]   So we end up with a range rather than a hard and set 4%.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.740]   Well, 4% is just the starting point.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.780]   It's good that he knows about it,
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.300]   but his situation's gonna be much more nuanced than that.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.660]   - I like it.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.500]   - It's kind of like how Buffett
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.780]   gets a different breakfast sandwich
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.060]   depending on what the market's doing that day, right?
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.780]   - That's the exact analogy that I used, yeah, exactly.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.700]   The Buffett withdrawal strategy.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.980]   - All right, next question.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.620]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Jacob.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.260]   The worst-kept secret in my industry at the moment
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.180]   is that the private equity-owned tech company I work at
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.620]   is about to be sold.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:24.620]   Rather than granting RSUs or ISO or NSOs,
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.100]   like many companies,
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.340]   my company grants an instrument
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.100]   called profit interest, PIUs.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.460]   I'm granted these at a basis of $0,
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.780]   and I understand there's some tax advantage
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.620]   to this particular type of grant upon sale
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.020]   with some or all units being taxed
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.780]   at the long-term capital gains rate.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.920]   However, I find research on the internet to be very unqueer
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.120]   because they just aren't very common.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.700]   Can you help a confused tech worker
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.900]   understand his tax implications this year?
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.160]   - The chat right now is going nuts
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.700]   for people coming with different names for FIRE,
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:00.580]   so anyway, all right, I gotta be honest here.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.900]   I've never heard of the PIUs before either.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.220]   Obviously, the cost basis of zero sounds appealing to me,
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.540]   but, and this person thinks
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.860]   that this company is about to be sold,
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.300]   so I'm sure they're starting to count these as well.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.460]   So what are we dealing with here?
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.780]   - So this is an interesting thing.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.980]   We have a client right now
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.620]   that we were just working through this with,
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.700]   profits interest units.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.340]   So it's common in like RIAs, law firms, REITs,
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.500]   in this case, an up REIT.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.980]   So imagine that you own a real estate portfolio
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.140]   and that rather than selling it and realizing taxes,
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.940]   you can exchange it for units in the company
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.980]   in this capital account that has a zero balance.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.540]   So it's effectively worth $0 and you can defer taxes
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.680]   or get creative with your tax situation there.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.380]   In another way, it's a way to turn
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.900]   what would normally be compensation.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.580]   Like say that you make $500,000,
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.380]   you're a highly compensated executive
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.580]   at a publicly traded company, a REIT, for example,
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.700]   and 200 of that is in the form of PIUs.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.140]   There's some risks associated with that,
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.660]   but you can effectively turn that compensation
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.980]   into capital gains.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.180]   So that's the advantage.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.520]   And it follows under the carried interest rule
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.540]   because you own an interest in the future appreciation,
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.460]   potential appreciation of the partnership.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.300]   So there's other risks as well.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.700]   - See, this is why the big guy always wins.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.620]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.940]   They can sell their real estate portfolio to an up REIT
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.860]   and also their step up in basis.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.620]   - So that sounds, so you're going to capital gains taxes
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.560]   as opposed to income tax.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.220]   So that sounds like a pretty good deal then, obviously.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.300]   - It's a pretty sweet deal if all goes well,
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.460]   if you hit the performance metrics or time metrics
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.620]   and so on and so forth.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.340]   So, but it is being scrutinized or it has been,
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.900]   at least it was under the Inflation Reduction Act.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.160]   I guess we'll see where that ends up.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.180]   But so you own these units with a $0 balance
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.220]   and then whatever that appreciates to,
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.420]   and it can be exchanged for cash or stock.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.220]   In his case though, he's wondering,
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.500]   if the business gets sold this year,
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.540]   what happens to my PIUs?
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.040]   And you're not finding it on Google
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.460]   because you're looking in the wrong place.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.400]   Where you need to be looking is your plan document.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.220]   You can probably download this from,
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.480]   or get this from HR, for example.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.640]   Just open it up, search acquisition
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.900]   and see what that document spells out.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.920]   If it's not there, it might be in the other documents
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.040]   from the sale of the business or potential sale.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.620]   So I would talk to people there
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.360]   and see how that's going to transpire
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.160]   because the worst case scenario
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.760]   is that your PIUs are forfeited
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.480]   because of that acquisition.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.460]   - That would be tough.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.840]   - Yeah, that would kind of suck.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.880]   I mean, he didn't pay anything for them though.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.680]   And hopefully he filed an 83B
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.880]   to kind of mitigate some of these risks of forfeiture
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.180]   and like he started the clock early.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.440]   But, and sometimes you're forced to file the 83B.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.360]   But in his case, worst case, forfeiture.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.880]   Other cases, which would probably,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.060]   I would hope would be the situation
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.900]   was that you get to exchange them for either more PIUs,
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.740]   but potentially that might restart the clock.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.940]   Or you get to exchange it for stock.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.840]   And then how that's taxed is depending
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.600]   on how that all goes through.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.420]   If it's going to be a capital asset
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.800]   or if it's going to be income.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.160]   - You want to talk to an expert here.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.600]   - Yeah, you want to download this document
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.560]   and send it over to your CPA and say,
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.240]   "Help me interpret this."
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.560]   Because yeah, there's a lot of jargon in there.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.720]   - For our younger and new investors,
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.780]   can you just briefly explain why a company would issue these?
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.720]   What's the idea behind these?
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.560]   - With PIUs, so you don't have to come out of pocket
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.760]   for them, they're granted to you.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.600]   It's kind of like a stock appreciation, right?
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.920]   They're granted to you at $0.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.520]   You can file an 83B and pay zero tax.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.240]   You just pay postage to send it in through certified mail.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.920]   And then after three years,
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.480]   and it has to be three years instead of two,
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.680]   after three years, you can sell at a capital gains rate.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.200]   And it's based on essentially, I think like the spread.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.680]   So whatever that capital account balance is,
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.800]   if it's stock, if it's dividends, income,
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.640]   or just appreciation and growth,
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.600]   so it ties into performance.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.440]   - So the company's giving you a priority.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.760]   - Or tax deferred capital, right?
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.000]   - Yeah.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.820]   - It's another form of conversation
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.320]   that can help you defer some taxes.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.560]   And it sounds like a sweet deal.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.120]   - Especially if you're recruiting somebody
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.360]   from Zillow to come over and you work for a REIT
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.480]   and you say, "We'll pay 30, 40% of your compensation
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.160]   "in the form of PIUs and it'll be taxed at capital gains."
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.000]   - Gotcha.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.640]   - So Gabe Plotkin paying 15% carried interest
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.120]   on his 20% performance fees.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.640]   - Yeah, can Gabe use these to buy the Hornets?
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.140]   I'm just trying to understand this.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.880]   - Pretty sweet deal, unless you work for maybe Oatly.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.080]   - Yeah.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.920]   - Sorry, sorry Duncan.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.040]   - All right, twisting the knife.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.240]   All right, last question.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   - Okay, last but not least, we have a question from Colin.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.840]   "My wife and I bought our home in 2020
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.200]   "and walked in a low-fixed 30-year mortgage
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.380]   "for first-time homebuyers.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.980]   "We've been paying down the mortgage at a rate
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.200]   "where it would be off the books in 20 years
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.540]   "so we'd be mortgage-free at 45.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.420]   "With lower returns in traditional markets expected,
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.000]   "does this make sense or does it make more sense
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.180]   "to pivot and invest that additional amount
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.240]   "in our retirement accounts?
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.480]   "We've been fortunate enough to max out our Roths and HSAs
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.640]   "but haven't reached the max on our 401(k) contributions.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.920]   "We don't view our home as an investment
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.280]   "but we do view our time as one."
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.400]   - Yeah, I like that last line there.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.240]   That's pretty good.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.600]   So, low-rate mortgage, they wanna know if,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.480]   they're thinking lower expected returns
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.440]   in the stock market going forward because of valuations.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.880]   I don't know what the stock market returns
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.240]   are gonna be in the future, nor does anyone else.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.940]   I can give you educated guess based on current valuations
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.360]   and dividend yields and historical earnings growth,
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.400]   but the people who were doing those calculations
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.520]   in the 2010s were wildly off on what the returns would be.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.900]   So, Nick, I think one of the most important jobs
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.260]   for a financial advisor is setting expectations
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.800]   for future returns, especially when thinking
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.680]   through something like this,
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.640]   because you have not only the hurdle rate potential
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.980]   where you're saying, "Well, you probably have a three
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.820]   "or 4% mortgage, so it's a pretty low hurdle rate
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:57.440]   "to get over, and the house is illiquid, obviously,"
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.000]   but there's also the idea of setting expectations
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.460]   for like, "We have to plan about this
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.220]   "without knowing what the future returns are going to be."
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.480]   So, how do you handle this when dealing with clients
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.880]   in terms of setting expectations?
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.840]   You want it to be reasonable,
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.400]   but we don't know what they're going to be for sure.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.320]   - Yeah, I like to just be really clear
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.680]   and about what you could potentially see.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.640]   So, kind of stemming from the first question
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.080]   of there were these periods in the market
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.160]   where you had flat or negative returns, right?
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.200]   That very well could happen.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.480]   But what it comes down to is that the best advice
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.320]   is going to be the right advice for your plan
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.200]   and for long-term.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.620]   It's not always going to look great over the short-term.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.440]   So, we could say, "The best thing for you to do
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.160]   "in this scenario is to not pay down that mortgage
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.840]   "at 3% to invest," because we think long-term
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.400]   in an 80/20 portfolio, let's say 7% is your average.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.240]   That's a pretty good spread.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.080]   And I'll take that all day.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.800]   Plus, I've got the flexibility.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.640]   It's not a liquid.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.280]   And especially in this guy's case or girl's case,
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.080]   they're, what, 28 years old maybe at this point.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.520]   They started the mortgage three years ago
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.160]   and it could be paid off in 20 years.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.400]   I would be leaning more towards that,
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.200]   especially if valuations are lower,
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   returns are lackluster, it's a land grab.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.320]   I'm going to accumulate as many shares of VTI
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.000]   or whatever you choose to invest in over that time period.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.220]   But setting that expectation is to say,
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.700]   "Hey, there could be an extended period
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.800]   "where this is going to look like a really bad decision."
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.600]   But sticking with it long-term, it'll even itself out.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.000]   And then the growth years that follow will offset--
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.360]   - The other thing is that if they,
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.040]   sure, they want to be out of their house at 45
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.880]   and maybe retire early or something,
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.000]   but they can't touch the tax-deferred money anyway.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.680]   So I think at that point, you want to,
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.360]   if we have a bad period for them in their late 20s,
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.280]   that's a good thing for them.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.320]   They're picking up shares at a lower price.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.600]   So if they think returns are going to be lower going forward,
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.340]   you want to be investing that cash.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.100]   And I just think for young people,
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.260]   unless you just have an aversion to debt
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.620]   that's going to make you sick to your stomach if you have it,
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.760]   I don't see the point of giving up that low-rate debt,
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.780]   considering that the rate of inflation right now
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.660]   at 3% over the last 12 months
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.500]   is equal to those mortgage rates for most people,
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.860]   and you're earning more money in T-bills than you were.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.180]   I mean, you can earn 5.5% in T-bills right now
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.980]   as opposed to paying down that mortgage.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.700]   I would much prefer to let that mortgage stand
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.640]   and use that leverage now that we were given a gift
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.960]   of those low rates back then.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.700]   I would be in no hurry to pay that off,
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.380]   especially if inflation is going to be higher
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.900]   and rates are going to be higher or whatever going forward.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.740]   Who knows?
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.980]   You could always pay it off later,
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.460]   but I think the compounding effects
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.380]   from being in the stock market over the long-term
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.780]   far outweigh the ability to pay it on your mortgage
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:31.660]   and have it paid off.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.440]   - Yeah, I mean, so that's where you start.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.260]   With every question, this was a really popular question
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.660]   like over the last three years, right?
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.580]   So we start off with,
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.740]   there's an optimal versus reasonable scenario.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.180]   What is optimal is going to be
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.980]   what I give you on this spreadsheet,
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.740]   and what is reasonable is going to be
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:47.860]   how you feel about debt
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.400]   and if you want to be financially free,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.780]   or when you're 45 or if you want to retire,
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.740]   and then think about the difference between
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.100]   you're dumping, like in the scenario that I created,
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.060]   if the mortgage was five,
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.880]   if you bought a $500,000 house, put 100,000 down,
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.800]   and you put an extra 500 bucks a month onto the note,
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.100]   you'll pay it off in 20 years.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.620]   But instead of investing that 120 grand into your house,
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.800]   why not put it in the market?
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.740]   Like, look at that scenario.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.780]   Like, sure, you free up cash flow,
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.860]   but when you're 45, but then again,
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.900]   wouldn't you rather have that larger balance outside
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.820]   with more flexibility?
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.260]   And maybe it's not in a tax-deferred account.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.980]   Maybe this is all in a brokerage account,
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.700]   so we can kind of knock down the returns a little bit
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.620]   than just for taxes.
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.460]   But still, it's an optimal versus reasonable scenario
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.860]   depending on what his goals are,
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.440]   what the plan looks like.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.580]   So, that's where I end up with that one,
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.880]   and then just managing expectations.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.940]   Going back to sequence of returns to be specific.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:47.780]   - I think you wanna give yourself
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.020]   as much flexibility as possible.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.420]   If you're looking at something to do in your mid-40s
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.780]   or early 50s or whatever.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.580]   - And so many question marks about this case, too.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.980]   Like, he's planning on having,
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.740]   or she or they are planning on having kids.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.340]   I mean, you have two or three kids.
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.460]   Like, they might take all of your extra cash flow anyway.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.460]   They might all go to daycare.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.140]   So, this conversation is moot.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.020]   And I mean, when I bought a house at 25,
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.420]   I wasn't thinking that I would be there
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.260]   for 40 years or even 20 years.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.700]   So, there's a lot of different things that could change.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.600]   - Yeah, so you wanna give yourself a margin of safety.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.300]   - Are houses even built the last 40 years anymore?
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.120]   I don't even know.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:21.960]   - I don't think so.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.740]   They discontinued the packages from Stage, right?
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.820]   Or not Stage, Sears.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.660]   You can't buy a house
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.660]   and have it charted over on a trolley anymore,
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.500]   and it lasts for a decade.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.340]   - We'll check back in 40 years.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.220]   - Century, yeah.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.100]   - I sure hope so, Duncan.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.100]   - Yeah, I mean, you would hope, but I'm just saying.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.820]   I don't know, I have my doubts.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:39.660]   - All right.
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.620]   I wanna thank Nick for coming on
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.740]   and helping us with some pension planning questions.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.040]   We appreciate all your questions, as usual.

[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.820]   People yell at Duncan on the street sometimes.
