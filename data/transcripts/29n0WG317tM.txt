[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.240]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.080]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.480]   Today, my guest is Dr. David Linden.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.700]   Dr. David Linden is a professor of neuroscience
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.740]   at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.220]   His laboratory has studied neuroplasticity,
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.800]   that is, how connections in the brain change
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.560]   in response to experience.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.320]   Much of that work focused on a structure
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.960]   called the cerebellum,
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.540]   which is also sometimes referred to as the mini brain,
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.360]   because it looks like a mini brain
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.400]   in the bottom and back of the human brain,
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.120]   and it's responsible for an enormous number
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.520]   of basic functions that we use in everyday life,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.660]   including our motor behavior,
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.600]   that is, our ability to walk and talk,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.520]   but also dance, play instruments,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.200]   and it's responsible for an enormous number
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.300]   of basic functions that we use in everyday life,
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.200]   including our sense of balance,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.760]   our ability to learn new motor behaviors,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.720]   as well as our sense of timing.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.320]   Today, we will discuss the cerebellum and what it does,
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.640]   but Dr. David Linden will also teach us
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.040]   about the important sense of touch,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.000]   as well as what makes us different as individuals.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.840]   The reason today's discussion encompasses
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.640]   so many important topics is that Dr. David Linden's
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.120]   laboratory has focused on many of those topics,
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.080]   and he is also the author of five excellent popular books
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.980]   about neuroscience that focus on, for instance,
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.420]   our sense of pleasure and where it originates from
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.260]   and what controls it in the brain,
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.360]   as well as our sense of touch.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.160]   And today, we start off our discussion
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.820]   by talking about the recent discovery of a set of neurons
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.240]   that have been known about for a long period of time,
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.680]   but that only recently have been characterized
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.520]   that are involved in sensual touch in particular,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.260]   and it's a fascinating conversation, I assure you.
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.660]   In addition to that, Dr. David Linden informs us
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.080]   about what makes us individuals,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.120]   how each and every one of us
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.280]   perceives the same things differently,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.380]   and it's an absolutely fascinating conversation,
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.440]   which tells you, for instance,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.060]   why some of you think a smell is putrid,
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.260]   indeed smells like vomit,
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.580]   whereas others perhaps are not bothered by that smell,
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.820]   and why others still are attracted to that smell,
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.120]   or something that you look at or something that you hear.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.500]   We also talk about nature versus nurture
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.200]   and how we come to be who we are,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.140]   not just through our genes and epigenetics,
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.580]   but also through our early childhood experience
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.400]   and adult experience.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.200]   And then in the latter third of our conversation,
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.480]   we shift to talking about
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.460]   the so-called mind-body connection
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.980]   and the science underlying how our thoughts
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.020]   inform our bodily health, or lack thereof,
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.980]   as well as how the organs of our body
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.900]   control the chemicals, hormones,
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.100]   and thoughts within our brain.
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.140]   Then we shift to discussing Dr. David Linden himself
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.020]   and the fact that in 2020,
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.760]   he was diagnosed with a form of heart cancer
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.880]   that led his physicians to tell him
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.700]   that he had six to 12 months to live.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.260]   Now, obviously, because he was in our studio
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.220]   to record this conversation,
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.780]   he has outlived that prognosis,
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.840]   but he lives day-to-day with the knowledge
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.060]   that his death may very well come soon,
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.980]   although it isn't clear exactly
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.600]   when that day will come, of course.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.620]   He tells us how the initial prognosis of his cancer,
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.040]   as well as outliving that prognosis,
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.180]   has informed his day-to-day life,
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.740]   as well as his thinking and his relationships.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.260]   And that leads to a very direct
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.680]   and frankly emotional conversation
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.300]   that includes advice on how all of us
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.620]   can get the most out of our daily living
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.800]   and out of our overall life.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.860]   It's an extremely powerful conversation
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.160]   that I believe everyone,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.500]   regardless of age or health status, can benefit from.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   And it's one that makes clear
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.040]   that not only is Dr. David Linden a spectacular scientist,
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.180]   but also a spectacular educator,
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.420]   a spectacular popular writer,
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.080]   a spectacular family man,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.420]   including husband and father and friend
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.620]   to many people and his colleagues,
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.760]   but he is also a courageous
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.140]   and spectacularly generous human being.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.960]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.360]   that this podcast is separate
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.640]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.760]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.640]   about science and science-related tools
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.960]   to the general public.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.000]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.860]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.740]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.800]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.200]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.040]   The company was founded
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.020]   by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.440]   and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.660]   were designed with performance in mind.
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.480]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.320]   of the visual system,
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.760]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.400]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.640]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.240]   Roca understands those challenges
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.020]   and the biology of the visual system,
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.720]   such that they've designed sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.400]   that always allow you to see with crystal clarity.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.680]   Now, initially, Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.140]   were designed for sports performance,
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.980]   and as a consequence,
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.980]   all of their glasses are designed to be very lightweight
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.500]   and to not slip off your face if you get sweaty.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.520]   However, the design of the glasses
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.560]   includes some that are specifically for sport
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.040]   and others whose aesthetic
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.660]   really allows you to use them for sport
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.440]   as well as out to dinner or to work, et cetera,
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.760]   and that's how I use them.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.180]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.600]   you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.960]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.040]   to save 20% off your first order.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.400]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.880]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.680]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.300]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.840]   how different foods and behaviors affect your health
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.000]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.200]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.520]   One of the most important factors
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.000]   impacting your immediate and long-term health
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.680]   is the way that your body manages its blood glucose,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.340]   or sometimes referred to as blood sugar levels.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.920]   To maintain energy and focus throughout the day,
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.680]   you want to keep your blood glucose steady
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.680]   without big spikes or dips.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.440]   Using Levels, you can monitor how different types of foods
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.300]   and different food combinations,
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.900]   as well as food timing and things like exercise,
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.500]   combine to impact your blood glucose levels.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.920]   I started using Levels a little over a year ago,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.300]   and it gave me a lot of insight
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.920]   into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.520]   and then leaving me feeling tired
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.080]   for several hours afterwards,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.300]   as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.320]   was impacting my overall energy.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.640]   And in doing so, it really allowed me to optimize
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.620]   how I eat, what I eat, when I exercise, and so on,
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.320]   such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.860]   are stable throughout the day.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.700]   If you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.340]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.160]   go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.440]   Right now, Levels is offering
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.360]   an additional two free months of membership.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.240]   Again, that's levels.link, L-I-N-K/huberman
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.080]   to get two free months of membership.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.040]   We are always striving
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   to make the Huberman Lab Podcast better,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.060]   and to that end, we need your help.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.900]   Over the next month,
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.080]   we are going to be carrying out a survey.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.140]   The purpose of the survey
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.140]   is to improve the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.160]   according to your feedback.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.420]   We put together a brief survey
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.680]   to understand what you love about the podcast.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.580]   Hopefully you love a few things at least,
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.120]   or maybe just one thing,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.000]   as well as what you think could be improved,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.240]   or perhaps the many things that you think could be improved
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.120]   about the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.540]   Basically, what we are asking is to get your feedback
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.040]   so that we can improve any and all things
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.320]   about the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.220]   The survey does not take long,
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.260]   and every single response will be reviewed.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.320]   As a thank you for completing the survey,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.160]   we are offering two months free

[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.500]   Professor Linden, welcome.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.420]   - Thanks so much for having me.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.940]   - I've been looking forward to our conversation,
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.740]   and we have a lot to talk about.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.020]   - We do.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.380]   - Lots of different aspects of science,
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.020]   lots of different aspects of personal journey
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.520]   and what you're confronting now
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.840]   as it relates to your health and your future.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.460]   I want to start off with a question
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.780]   that I learned from the one and only
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.260]   the great Carl Deisseroth,
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.180]   who was the first guest on this podcast,
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.240]   my colleague at Stanford.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.040]   And for those of you that don't recognize Carl's name,
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.320]   he is a absolute phenom.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.780]   He's a active clinical psychiatrist.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.600]   So he's an MD, and he also is a bioengineer
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.160]   who's developed a lot of the modern tools
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.040]   for probing the brain.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.220]   And anytime I've met with Carl,
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.120]   the first thing he says is,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.480]   "What are you most excited about lately?"
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.320]   - That's a good question.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.380]   - It is.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.600]   So I'm gonna steal that approach and say,
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.260]   "What are you most excited about lately?"
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.760]   - Well, very, very lately,
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.780]   the most interesting thing that I read in neuroscience
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:06.780]   is the answer to a scientific problem
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.580]   that I think is really dear to a lot of people's hearts.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.580]   And that is, what are the nerve endings in the genitals
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.120]   that are responsible for sexual sensation?
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.920]   And if you think about it, right,
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.740]   people can feel sexy from being touched
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.440]   on lots of different parts of the body.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.480]   But there's something special about the genitals.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.640]   Doesn't matter male or female or intersex
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.480]   or gay or straight or bi or whatever you are,
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.100]   the genitals are a hotspot.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.240]   And why?
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.720]   And you'd think as biologists, we'd know this by now.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.780]   This would be something we could just answer.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.520]   But it's been a mystery for a long time.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.200]   And if you go back to 1860,
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.020]   there was a German neuroanatomist named Krauss.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.040]   And he cut thin sections of tissue
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.440]   from the penis and the clitoris.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.560]   And he looked at them under the microscope.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.040]   And he saw a particular kind of nerve ending there
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.840]   that has since been called the Krauss corpuscle.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.460]   And there were lots of them in these two places.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.620]   And so he thought, well,
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.240]   maybe this is the cellular basis of sexual sensation.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.540]   Maybe these are the particular nerve endings
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.840]   that are responsible for this.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.960]   But there were some things that were in favor of that
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.520]   and some not.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.500]   So these nerve endings are also in some other places
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.040]   that people can find more or less sexy,
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.580]   like they're in the nipples and they're in the lips
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.640]   and they're in the anus,
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.580]   all places that get popular in that domain.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.780]   But they're also in places like the cornea
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.400]   or the lining of the joints.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.540]   So the distribution doesn't quite make sense.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.760]   And so it was never known.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.240]   And so if you wanted to really test as a scientist
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.320]   whether these nerve endings are responsible,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.840]   you want to record their electrical signals
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.280]   while the genitals are being touched.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.960]   You'd want to inactivate these cells
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.400]   and see if you could interfere with sexual sensation.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.580]   And this in a preprint from David Ginty's group at Harvard
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.280]   is just what they have been able to do in mice.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.920]   They found a way to label and record from
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.840]   and activate and inactivate artificially
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.080]   the Krauss corpuscles.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.320]   And so you see a nerve ending in the skin,
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.880]   it could be conveying all kinds of information.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.200]   It could be tuned for hot or for cold or for itch
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.840]   or for pain or for inflammation
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.920]   or for mechanical sensation,
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.520]   stretching, vibration, indentation.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.800]   And sure enough,
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.160]   when they recorded from these Krauss corpuscles,
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.120]   they really are mechanical sensors,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.160]   as you would expect if they were involved
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.720]   in sexual sensation, so that was good.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.320]   And then the other thing,
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.740]   then what they did is they tried
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.400]   to artificially turn them on.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.200]   And so the way they did that is they used genetic tricks
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   to express one of Karl Deisseroth's molecules
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.880]   that activates neurons when blue light is shown on them.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.160]   And they found that if they express
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.320]   this artificial protein in the Krauss cells
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.760]   in a male mouse and then shine blue light,
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.280]   the mouse gets an erection.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.120]   All right, so far so good.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.680]   What happens if you turn them off?
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.800]   Well, if you turn them off in a male mouse,
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.160]   it's just as interested in females when they're in heat,
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.160]   but it won't mount and thrust and ejaculate as much.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.040]   And if you turn them off in a female mouse,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.360]   during the time of her cycle
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.260]   where she would normally be sexually receptive,
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.920]   you find that she is much less interested.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.960]   She's much less likely to let him mount.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.920]   She's much less likely to let him finish.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.880]   So this is the remarkable result
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   that finally after all these years, since 1860,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.540]   now we know what the nerve endings are
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.980]   that convey sexual sensation.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.900]   And like all good science, then there are a lot of questions
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.240]   that are really interesting to our everyday lives.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.360]   Like people like different things in bed
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.160]   and have different propensity for orgasm
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.880]   or like to be touched in different ways.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.700]   Well, is part of that reason because of individual variation
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.260]   in their Krauss corpuscle structure?
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:51.040]   We know that sexual sensation diminishes with aging.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.800]   Is that in part because Krauss corpuscle density
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.880]   is lost from the skin of the genitals?
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.520]   And that's a reasonable idea because we know, for example,
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.280]   that fine touch sensors in the fingertips,
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.840]   so-called Merkel and Meisner endings,
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.400]   also named after German anatomists like so many things are,
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.760]   are also lost with age.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.060]   So that's a reasonable idea.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.360]   So this finding from Ginty's lab
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.740]   has opened up a whole world of science.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.280]   And I've been, my own lab doesn't work on touch,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.760]   but I've been a fanboy of touch for many, many years,
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.780]   mostly because where I work at Johns Hopkins Medical School,
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.920]   there have been many terrific touch researchers.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.440]   It's been a world center for it.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.140]   And I hear about it over lunch and I got all fired up.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.120]   So years ago I wrote a book about it
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.680]   and I still follow the field.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.040]   And this is the most interesting thing
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.360]   in that field recently.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.200]   - And as I recall, Ginty was your neighbor at Hopkins
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.720]   before he moved to Harvard.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.840]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   He was one of the ones, Ginty, Stephen Shao,
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.200]   Michael Katerina, Xin Zhongdong.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.600]   There've been a number of world leaders
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.760]   in the cellular basis of touch sensation at Hopkins.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.780]   - Do you recall if in the pre-print that you were describing
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.880]   there was an experiment where they activated
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.800]   these Krauss corpuscles in females?
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.120]   - It's funny, you should mention that.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.920]   I sent that exact email to David Ginty
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.000]   and they said they are in the process
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.240]   of doing that right now and they don't quite know yet.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.520]   And so I asked him, I said, so for example,
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.720]   is erection of the clitoris even a thing in mice?
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.360]   And he says, well, we're really not sure.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.840]   So we're activating the Krauss corpuscles in female mice
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.920]   and we're just kinda staring at it
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.040]   and looking and see if anything happens.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.040]   Does the body change shape?
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.700]   Is there a color change?
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.680]   They don't even quite know what it is.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.540]   They're looking for it 'cause it's that much
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.520]   on the leading edge of things, but it's a good question.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.320]   - Yeah, or perhaps the female mice would be more willing
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.060]   to mate outside of the usual timeframe of receptivity
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.680]   if these Krauss corpuscles are stimulated.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.520]   - That's possible.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   My suggestion, my guess would be not
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.200]   because I think that the hormonal regulation of receptivity
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.440]   is like a sledgehammer and very hard to overcome,
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.380]   but they might be more willing to continue mating
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.080]   or mate for longer during their fertile time.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.480]   - And I just wanna remind people
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.320]   because we had a guest recently, Dr. Rina Malik,
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.400]   who's a urologist, reproductive and sexual health expert.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   She's an MD.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   And she made clear that the clitoris and the penis
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.460]   come from the same embryonic origin.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.020]   They are analogous tissues in different individuals.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.540]   I do have one more question about this sexual touch thing.
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.240]   These are peripheral nerves, right?
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.240]   So these are not of the brain and spinal cord.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.360]   They're in what we call the periphery.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.840]   And my understanding is that peripheral neurons regenerate
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.920]   and can remodel themselves extensively in ways
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.160]   that neurons within the brain and spinal cord
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.640]   tend to remodel less, especially as one gets older
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.480]   out of the so-called critical period.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.200]   Is it possible that these cross corpuscles
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.780]   and their patterns of innervation within the genitals
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.700]   change according to the stimulation that people experience?
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.700]   In other words, is sexual sensation experience dependent?
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.300]   - That is a great question.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.300]   And so we don't know because monitoring this in people
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:45.120]   is not technically possible, right?
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.860]   It requires cadaver tissue.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.820]   So you can only do it once.
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.440]   In animals, it will be possible.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.300]   And it could be for a couple of different reasons.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.900]   In other words, it could be, I think what you're imagining
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.060]   is that there's actual structural plasticity.
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.340]   If you looked at these cross corpuscles
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.260]   or that you would actually see them changing
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.420]   their shape or their size or their density
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.460]   as a result of experience.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.720]   But what can also happen is a phenomenon
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.100]   like desensitization.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.240]   That is to say when there's stimulation for a long time,
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:28.240]   then the receptors transiently can become
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.960]   less sensitive to touch.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.760]   And it's well known, particularly in males,
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.760]   that chronic masturbation can produce desensitization
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.760]   of sexual sensation in the penis.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.380]   And that could be as a result of a physical change,
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.680]   a morphological change in the cross corpuscles.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.080]   But it's more likely to be a change in their function
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.200]   that you wouldn't be able to simply see
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.300]   by looking at an outline of their structure
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.120]   in the microscope.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.480]   - Such an interesting topic.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.920]   Thanks for opening things up with that.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.200]   And I'll have to check out this preprint.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.400]   I'm also a huge fan of David Guinty's work and colleagues.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.640]   There are many people involved in that domain of work,
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.480]   of course.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:18.180]   I'd like to talk about your recent book
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:23.180]   and the sort of underlying basis of what led you to write it
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.480]   and what intrigued you about this idea
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.500]   of human individuality.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.080]   The book "Unique" is one that we'll provide a link to
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.140]   in the show note captions.
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:38.140]   And it's a very interesting idea that we are all different,
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.680]   especially coming from a neuroscientist who,
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.200]   we were trained at least similarly to learn that,
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.260]   sure, the bumps and ripples of the brain
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.920]   and the fine wiring of the brain is different
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.640]   and we are all unique and different.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.140]   We have different shapes, AKA morphologies,
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.720]   but focusing on human individuality is not something
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.080]   that modern neuroscience or classic neuroscience
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.700]   has really done much of.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.980]   It's really focused on how people do X
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.900]   or people do Y this way.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.040]   - Tell us about "Unique" and tell us
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.360]   about human individuality.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.260]   - Yeah, well, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.880]   So when I look at the experiments in my own lab,
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.940]   how do we do them?
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.580]   Well, we work on mice.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.700]   Do we work on mice with genetic variation?
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.700]   No, we work on highly inbred mice that are designed
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.120]   to be as genetically similar to each other as possible.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.040]   And then we raise them basically in prism,
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.340]   in little cells, which may not be a good idea.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.520]   And we try to give them as similar experience as possible.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.340]   - They are given toys and food and water,
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.840]   but I agree, it resembles a prison of sorts.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.620]   They aren't free to roam.
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.860]   - They have nothing like the experience of a wild mouse.
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.260]   Let me put it that way.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.300]   And yes, there are, as you said correctly,
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.140]   there are plenty of experiments
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.320]   where there's enrichment for mice and they love it.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.540]   So for example, in our lab, when we put running wheels
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.900]   in the cages or mice and let them run overnight,
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.020]   they're active at night, your average mouse
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.340]   will run two kilometers in a night for a little tiny mouse.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.100]   And some of the mice are so intense,
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.220]   they will run 20 kilometers.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.140]   Imagine a mouse doing 20K, but it will happen.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.420]   They really, really like it.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.800]   They don't like being in prison.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.260]   They want to exercise and they're really bored.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.600]   So yes, to get back to your general point,
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.400]   so much of science is designed to try to find
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   general principles of function of the brain,
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.020]   of physiology, of genetics,
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.360]   and to ignore individual variation.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.720]   But individual variation is so important
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   to our human experience and actually is so important
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.620]   to the process of evolution and natural selection
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:04.420]   and how species make their way in the world
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:09.420]   that it's something that requires a lot of attention.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.400]   And to me, what's really fascinating
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.400]   is that when you look at the variation
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.500]   in the way sense organs function,
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.680]   it's almost a miracle that we can agree
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   on a common reality at all, even within the human species.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:37.180]   And this is true of some senses more than others.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.040]   Obviously in your world, in the retina,
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.060]   we have various kinds of loss of color vision
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.260]   that are well known and some other more complicated
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.880]   phenomena having to do with impairments
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.140]   in the perception of motion or form.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.240]   But the place where this really happens
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.840]   is in the olfactory system.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   So we have approximately 400 functional receptors
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.960]   for different odorant molecule smells in our nose.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.720]   And if you sequence the genomes of many people,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.720]   you find that the DNA that encodes
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:25.040]   for these odorant receptors is unusually variable
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.560]   from individual to individual.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.560]   As a matter of fact, if you take two different people,
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.700]   on average, they will have functional differences
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.920]   in 30% of their odor receptors.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.840]   And if you do as Leslie Vosall and her colleagues did
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.880]   at Rockefeller University and give odor tests
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.920]   where they give people different things to smell
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.080]   and then they dilute them and find the threshold
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.680]   at which they can detect them,
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.800]   you find enormous changes from people to people,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.540]   both in general terms.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.480]   Some people are just better smellers than others.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.940]   But in terms of individual odors as well,
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.120]   there are some odors that some people can't detect
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.400]   and other people smell one way.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.840]   For example, there is a secreted hormone
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.360]   called androstenone.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.860]   Androstenone, there are some people who can't smell it all.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.080]   For some people, it smells like rather pleasant,
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.580]   like cut grass.
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.700]   And for some people, it smells foul, like urine or sweat.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.920]   And it just depends on genetic variation
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.240]   in one particular odorant receptor.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.520]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.960]   Another phenomenal researcher who studies olfaction,
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.620]   among other things, Catherine Dulock,
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.800]   I once heard say that some people have a gene
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   that for them makes the smell of microwave popcorn.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.680]   They experience that smell as vomit.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.760]   And other people who lack this gene
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.920]   like the smell of microwave popcorn,
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.460]   or at least for them, it's not aversive.
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.600]   So it can really be a binary response.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.420]   - Well, it can.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.340]   And actually, that's a very particular funny case.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.360]   So the relevant chemical there is butyric acid
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.440]   and also isovaleric acid.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.040]   And so there are researchers,
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.240]   I think Rachel Hertz is one of them,
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.120]   who have given a mixture of these two chemicals to people.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.020]   And if they say, "This is Parmesan cheese,"
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.400]   they go, "Oh, yeah, that's Parmesan cheese."
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.740]   And if they give it to other people and say,
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.440]   "This is vomit," they'll go, "Oh, yeah, that's vomit."
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.320]   And if they tell people, they give them one vial
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.440]   and say, "This is Parmesan cheese,"
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.280]   and they go, "Yeah."
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.100]   And they give them another one, they say, "It's vomit."
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:49.940]   They go, "Yeah."
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.120]   And then they say, "Well, actually, we fooled you.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.100]   "It was the same vial."
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:52.940]   They say, "No, you didn't.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.340]   "You must have made a mistake."
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.360]   They're convinced that they couldn't have been
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.360]   the same thing.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.440]   So this points out not only is there genetic variation
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.440]   that is responsible for how individuals perceive odor,
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:13.180]   but we are incredibly suggestible in terms of odors.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:18.840]   And we are very dependent upon them
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.620]   in terms of cultural context.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.960]   And this can be learned.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.440]   And this is central to our humanity
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.400]   in the sense that we humans
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.760]   are what I like to call the anti-pandas.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.860]   Pandas live in one spot in southern China,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:43.160]   and they eat one thing, bamboo, and that's it.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.400]   Humans are the opposite.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.880]   Humans can live in any ecological niche in the world
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.720]   from the tropics to the poles,
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.500]   and humans eat a wide, wide, wide variety of foods.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.600]   And as a result, it means that we have to have
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.480]   a very plastic olfactory system.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.380]   There have to be very few things
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:06.160]   that we find innately aversive.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.240]   There are only a handful of odors, rotting meat odors.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.020]   Molecules with the evocative names like cadaverine
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.080]   and putrescine are things that even babies,
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.560]   when they're newborn, find aversive.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.520]   But other things happen that they need to be learned.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.780]   For example, pretty much every adult
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.600]   finds poop odors unpleasant,
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.160]   but babies happily play with their own poop.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.240]   They have to learn that that's disgusting.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.240]   It's not 'cause babies have a different nose.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.720]   It's because they have to learn culturally.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.720]   - It's not innate.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.640]   - It is not innate.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.880]   There are only a few innate odor aversions
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.240]   and a few innate taste aversions that we're born with,
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.000]   and the other things are elaborated culturally.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.680]   And we can think about this in terms
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.460]   of how we talk about odors.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:04.240]   So for example, we might say vanilla smells sweet.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.040]   Well, that's weird.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.080]   Those are two different senses.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.200]   How can something smell sweet?
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.120]   That's like saying it sounds red, right?
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.340]   - It's a statement about synesthesia.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.240]   - Right, but how did it come to pass?
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.440]   And do people say that vanilla smells sweet
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.720]   everywhere in the world?
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.500]   Well, the answer is no.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:29.000]   So in places in the world where vanilla is used with sugar
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.340]   in sweet foods like desserts,
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.400]   then people say that vanilla smells sweet,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.020]   or mint, similarly, smells sweet
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.760]   if it is typically used together with sugar.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.580]   But if you go to a place like Vietnam
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.260]   where mint is mostly used in savory dishes,
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.620]   people won't say that mint smells sweet.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.280]   - So there's a paired association there
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.180]   that at least at our level of conscious understanding
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:02.420]   feeds back onto what we call olfactory or smell perception,
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.760]   but really it must be a paired association
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.300]   at some point in development.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.140]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.940]   It absolutely is a paired association,
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.980]   and it's something that goes on continually
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.080]   through your life, right?
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.780]   I mean, lots of people, for example,
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:21.080]   have stories of foods that they wouldn't eat as a child,
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.580]   but they came to like as an adult.
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.840]   A good example of that is coffee.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.080]   A lot of people have to overcome bitter aversion
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.300]   to become coffee aficionados.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:40.100]   So this feeds into the more general theme
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:46.100]   that there is no pure perception.
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.800]   Perception is inference.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.620]   It's not like there is a purely objective world
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.760]   that can somehow make its way through the senses,
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.900]   and we can perceive that as the truth.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.740]   All of our perception through all of our senses,
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.380]   both the outward-pointing senses of the world,
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.980]   like smell and taste and sight and hearing,
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.540]   and the inward-pointing senses,
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:16.540]   like balance and is my stomach full, and things like that,
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:22.220]   all of them are based on experience and expectation
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.580]   and the situation of the moment.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.500]   - As many of you know,
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.180]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.620]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.940]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.780]   that's designed to meet
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.020]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.640]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.940]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.180]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.860]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.820]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.580]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.760]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.560]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.100]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better,
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.300]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.100]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.900]   "If you could take just one supplement, what would it be?"
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.580]   I answer, "AG1."
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.280]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.740]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.500]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.160]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.820]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:26.580]   Are there any examples of uniqueness of visual perception
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.620]   that come to mind?
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.020]   I recently did a social media post
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.620]   that involved, it was essentially three rings,
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.620]   a blue ring, a red ring, and a blue ring in the center.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.500]   Or perhaps it was the other way around.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.580]   Excuse me, it was red, blue, red.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.140]   And I asked which ring is in front
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.380]   or are they all in the same plane?
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.440]   Now, of course, it's a two-dimensional image.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.380]   And interestingly, it splits out into about thirds.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.780]   Some people see the blue ring in front quite a bit.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.160]   Others see a red ring out in front.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.760]   Others see them all in the same plane.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.380]   And this, we think, has to do with differences
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.520]   in two things between individuals.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.680]   One is the distribution of the cone photoreceptors,
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.980]   which we know is essentially random between individuals,
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.660]   maybe even between the two eyes.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.820]   And then, and that gives rise to this phenomenon
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.700]   of chromatic aberration, which is the displacement
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.940]   of the visual image according to the wavelength
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:30.780]   of the light.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.300]   And we won't get into the physics of it now.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.680]   I'll soon do a post that hopefully distills it
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.740]   in a manner that's simple enough that people understand.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.220]   But clearly, some people see certain colors
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.800]   in front of others, and the person right next to them
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.340]   could see the opposite color in front.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.600]   And others say, "What are you talking about?
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.380]   All the colors are in exactly the same plane of vision."
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.780]   So that's the one that I know.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.500]   I'm guessing you know some others
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.620]   and perhaps some more robust ones.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:02.500]   - Well, I think perhaps this is maybe not
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.620]   what you had in mind, but one way in which experience
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.460]   modifies the visual world has to do with how much light
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:15.460]   you're exposed to in the first five years or so of your life.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:21.020]   And so kids that don't get outside
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:25.380]   are much more likely to be myopic.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.780]   And it actually is--
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.620]   - Near-sighted.
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:32.420]   - Near-sighted, yes, when they grow up
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.060]   than kids who got outside.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.840]   And we now know that at least part of the story
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.840]   is that light seems to stimulate the expression
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.600]   of a class of molecules called trophic factors
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.140]   that you're well acquainted with
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.680]   that actually change the shape of the eyeball.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.360]   So it's not really the structure of the retina
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.260]   or the lens of the cornea.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:58.260]   The actual degree of elongation of the eyeball changes,
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:02.200]   changing the way the retina sits relative to the lens,
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.600]   and that seems to be light-dependent early in life,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   and which gives rise to a higher incidence of myopia.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:17.540]   And to me, this is really, well, first of all,
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.360]   it's news you can use.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.280]   You should get your kids outside for all kinds of reasons.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.520]   - And you should get outside too,
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.720]   especially in the morning, set that circadian rhythm.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.160]   - I know that's a famous Huberman-esque point.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.880]   - They're going to be putting me in the grave, David,
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.840]   and I'm going to be telling people to,
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.820]   or maybe it'll be on my tombstone.
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.240]   He'll say, "Get sunlight in your eyes,"
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:43.480]   especially on cloudy days, 'cause there is still sunlight,
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.300]   even if you can't see the physical object of the sun,
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.260]   on cloudy days.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:53.260]   - Well, I think this whole idea of having traits
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.960]   that are dependent upon early life experience
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.940]   is fascinating, because there are a number of situations
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.500]   where you would guess that something is genetic,
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.420]   but it isn't.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.940]   It's actually dependent on early life experience,
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.200]   and there's an amazing story about this having to do
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.800]   with the early days of World War II.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.040]   So in the early days of World War II,
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.720]   the Japanese army just swept through Asia.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.560]   They defeated the British and Malaysia and Singapore.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.480]   They overran Thailand and Burma,
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.240]   and they were knocking on the gates of India,
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.480]   and everything was going great,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.880]   except the Japanese army had a problem.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.160]   There were an enormous number of their soldiers
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.000]   who became incapacitated with heat stroke.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.160]   They got, their core temperature got too hot.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.960]   And when the army doctors examined them,
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.240]   they found this was much more likely to happen
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.040]   in soldiers who came from the northern part of Japan,
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.680]   Hokkaido, where it snows in the winter,
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.560]   as opposed to the southern part of Japan,
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.440]   like Kyushu, which is a semi-tropical environment.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.320]   And the classical explanation the biologists like us
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.720]   would guess would say, oh, all right,
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.600]   well, this has happened genetically over many years.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.920]   You have a family that's been in Kyushu
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.440]   for many generations, and you've selected
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.880]   four gene variants that allow you
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.200]   to tolerate the heat better.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.580]   And we know actually what this is.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.820]   So if you're more heat tolerant,
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.700]   it's because you have more of a particular class
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.020]   of sweat gland called the eccrine sweat glands,
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.740]   the sort of saltwater sweat glands,
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:39.300]   not the lippety, stinky, armpit sweat glands
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.880]   called the apocrine ones.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.600]   The eccrine ones, you have a higher fraction of them
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.580]   that are innervated, meaning that the signals
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.680]   from your brain that say your core is too hot
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.600]   can then make you sweat.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.000]   So the total density of sweat glands
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.560]   between northern and southern soldiers in Japan
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.680]   wasn't different, but the southern soldiers
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.840]   tend to have a higher degree of innervation.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.740]   All right, so you say, okay, well,
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.320]   this happened genetically over many generations.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.660]   But if you look at those rare cases
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.720]   where you have soldiers from a long-established
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.720]   northern family and their parents move south
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.500]   and they grew up in the southern location,
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.840]   they had high sweat gland innervation.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.600]   They were well heat tolerant.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.160]   Conversely, if you had a well-established
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.500]   southern Kyushu family and they moved to Hokkaido
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.840]   and then had their child, that child developed
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.120]   the northern sweat gland innervation pattern.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.580]   - So meaning less nerve innervation of those sweat glands,
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.560]   as you mentioned before, just as many sweat glands,
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.920]   just less nerve innervation.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.440]   Therefore, those sweat glands could not be activated.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.500]   They couldn't dump heat as well.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.080]   Their heat tolerance was lower, correct?
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.880]   - Exactly right, and what's wonderful
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   is that this gives an advantage
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.720]   that you can't get through evolution
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.840]   and that it can happen right away in one generation, right?
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.560]   Evolutionary change is slow, right?
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.040]   And you can adapt as a species and as a family
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.840]   over many, many, many generations,
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.500]   but when you have a phenomenon that is set
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:19.080]   by early life experience, well, then you can benefit
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.480]   from that early life experience within your own life.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.880]   It's not that your great, great, great, great,
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.880]   great grandchildren will ultimately benefit.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.920]   You benefit.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.040]   Another wonderful example of this
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:35.200]   comes from field mice, voles, and we were talking earlier
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.520]   about how we both worked with the scientist Irv Zucker
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:44.800]   at Berkeley, who was a specialist in voles,
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.000]   and what people found is that
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.280]   if you take wild-caught field mice
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   and you have pregnant mothers and you have them in the lab,
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.200]   but you manipulate the lights
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.080]   so that you have artificial spring.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.560]   In other words, day length is getting longer
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.520]   day after day during the pregnancy.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.300]   Then what happens is when their pups are born,
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.760]   they will have a low density of fur
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.100]   anticipating summer temperatures.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:24.040]   If you, however, put them in artificial fall
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.240]   where day length is getting shorter,
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.680]   they will be born now with high density
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.560]   of fur anticipating winter temperatures,
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.040]   and of course, you can do this
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:38.120]   no matter what the season actually is in the world
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.600]   by manipulating these lights in the lab,
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.580]   and so like the sweating Japanese soldiers,
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.700]   this is a great example of early life plasticity
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.040]   and just the sort of trait that if you ask someone,
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.580]   they would probably guess is heritable,
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.700]   but actually is not.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.120]   - Thanks for mentioning Irv Zucker,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.640]   who, as you also mentioned, was an advisor to us both,
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.800]   who's done incredible work in circadian biology,
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.140]   seasonal rhythms, hormones and behavior.
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.080]   I have such reverence for Irv,
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.880]   and the experiment you mentioned made me smile wide
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.800]   because it's but one of, gosh,
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.160]   maybe hundreds of incredible studies,
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.500]   so if people are interested in seasonal rhythms
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.240]   and circadian rhythms and biology
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.480]   of the most interesting kind,
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.780]   definitely check out Irving Zucker's work at Berkeley.
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.560]   I'll provide a link to his PubMed there.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.800]   Since we've been taking a tour of individual variation
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.360]   in olfactory perception, visual perception,
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.160]   and now heat tolerance, I have to ask,
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.440]   are you aware of any examples off the top of your head
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.400]   in the auditory domain that particularly intrigue you?
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:50.360]   - Yeah, well, I would say one really interesting example
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   has to do with perfect pitch, so perfect pitch as a trait,
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.360]   that is to say, you have the ability to hear a note played
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.920]   and say, oh, that's a C sharp, right?
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.480]   This is a pretty rare trait,
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:09.040]   so even if you look among highly trained musicians,
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.600]   if you went to Peabody Conservatory at my university,
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.880]   Johns Hopkins, and tested people there,
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.280]   you would find a higher incidence of perfect pitch
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.880]   than you would in the general population,
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.760]   but still, maybe one in 10 trained musicians
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.520]   have perfect pitch, and parenthetically,
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.640]   having perfect pitch doesn't necessarily
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.600]   make you a better musician,
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.960]   but it's an interesting phenomena,
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.840]   and so the question is, well, is perfect pitch heritable?
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:40.820]   And the answer is, when you look at twin studies,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.280]   which is what we use to estimate heritability,
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.120]   the answer is, it's kinda low.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.560]   There's a heritable component,
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:51.440]   but it accounts for, my recollection is on the order
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.000]   of 30, 40% of the variability in perfect pitch.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.360]   However, if people receive ear training
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.600]   starting at a young age,
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.140]   the chance that they will develop perfect pitch
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.160]   can improve drastically.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.880]   - In your book, Unique, do you cover aspects
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.680]   of human individuality that extend beyond
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.180]   the perception domain into the cognitive domain?
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.060]   - Well, yeah, absolutely, and you know,
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.460]   I think it's good to set the stage here
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.580]   if we're gonna be talking about heritability
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.540]   and human individuality,
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.720]   and so if I can go off on a little bit of a riff
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:39.520]   for the benefit of your listeners and viewers here.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.080]   So if you look at human traits,
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:46.320]   whether they're behavioral traits like shyness
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.640]   or very straightforward morphological traits
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.740]   like height, what you tend to find
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:57.320]   is that there are very few traits
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.340]   that are entirely heritable,
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.940]   where all their variability can be predicted
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.280]   based on the gene variants you get
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.900]   from your mother and father,
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:09.760]   and there are a few traits that are absolutely unheritable,
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.720]   but that most fall in between.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.720]   So let me give an example.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:18.040]   Everyone in the world has either wet or dry earwax,
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.680]   and it turns out that this is determined
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.920]   by variation in the single gene.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.360]   The name of the gene is boring.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.760]   It's ABCC11.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.360]   It's an ion transporter,
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.000]   and there's a variation in this gene
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.080]   gives rise to either wet or dry earwax.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.800]   It doesn't matter how your parents raised you.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.680]   It doesn't matter what foods you ate growing up.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.140]   It doesn't matter what diseases your mother had
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.280]   when you were in the womb.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.940]   It's 100% heritable.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.540]   Well, does this mean that ABCC11,
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.440]   we should call it the earwax type gene?
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.000]   Well, no, because it's not there just for that.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.460]   Like this gene is expressed in cells
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.860]   in all parts of the body doing all kinds of things.
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.560]   Earwax is just something that we notice.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.040]   Genes don't code for traits.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.880]   They code for proteins,
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.800]   and so we have to be careful
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.320]   about how we refer to them in that way.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:22.320]   For example, the wet earwax variant of the ABCC11 gene
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:27.160]   also confers a slightly higher risk for breast cancer.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:30.880]   So clearly it's not just for earwax.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.920]   It's for a bunch of things,
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.020]   most of which we don't yet know about.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:39.200]   But in the case of earwax, this trait is 100% heritable.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.840]   At the other end of the scale,
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.560]   speech accent is 0% heritable.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.500]   It is entirely dependent upon the speech
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:51.100]   that you experience in your childhood.
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.280]   And interestingly, it's the speech of your peers
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.920]   more than the speech of your family,
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.080]   which is why the children of immigrants
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.760]   sound like the place where they wound up,
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.840]   not like their parents.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.260]   And there is no evidence for any degree of heritability.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.280]   Now just to be clear, I'm talking about speech accent,
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.320]   like whether you have a high or a low voice
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.560]   or it's nasal or more or less resonant.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.240]   These are physical things having to do with the vocal tract
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.240]   and they are in part heritable.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.960]   Okay, so we've got one thing that's 100% heritable
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.920]   and one thing that's 0% heritable,
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.060]   but where do most things fall?
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:26.800]   Most things fall in the middle.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:30.720]   One of the most heritable traits
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.240]   that we know about in humans is height.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.840]   And in the United States,
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.840]   height is about 85% heritable.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.960]   85% of the variation in the trait of height
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.300]   can be explained by what you inherit
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.440]   from your mother and your father.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.440]   Well, what's the rest?
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.200]   Well, it's nutrition, it's the diseases you fought off,
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.200]   it's also random variation,
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.960]   which we'll talk about a lot later.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.080]   Now, you might say, okay, well,
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.900]   that's an estimate for people in the US.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.220]   Is this true all over the world?
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.600]   Well, no.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:12.160]   If you go to a place where people routinely
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.620]   don't get enough nutrition
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:18.400]   and are routinely fighting off infectious diseases,
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.120]   like this has been studied in rural Bolivia,
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.440]   for example, or rural India,
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.120]   now height is no longer 85% heritable,
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.280]   it's only 50% heritable.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.280]   Why?
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.280]   Because people in these situations
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.980]   where they don't get enough nourishment,
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.300]   where they're fighting off these diseases,
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.520]   can't live up to their genetic potential for height.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.040]   If you want to make things better
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.700]   for the people of the world,
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:54.700]   then everyone needs to have basic things
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.140]   like the ability to learn and enough nutrition
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.840]   and decent medical care and schools
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.120]   in order to fulfill their genetic potential
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.880]   for positive traits.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.200]   And height I've used as an example
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.720]   because it is very uncontroversial,
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:20.020]   but we could apply the very same analysis
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.640]   to intelligence, general intelligence.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.960]   Now, there are people who argue about,
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.120]   do things like IQ tests really measure anything real?
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.440]   And there's been a lot of fighting
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.920]   in the scientific literature about this,
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.660]   but I think intelligence tests aren't perfect
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.080]   and they are sometimes culture-bound,
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   but they are actually quite predictive of later success.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:49.440]   And much more so than, say, SAT tests or GRE tests
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.200]   or MCATs or other standardized tests.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.640]   - But presumably those correlate in some way.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.760]   - They do, I do.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.560]   But the IQ tests are better, actually.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.960]   - You're talking about the classic IQ test?
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.080]   - I am talking about the modern variance
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.480]   of the classic IQ tests that are administered
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:13.840]   by trained psychologists and aren't just a paper form.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.160]   And so they're not perfect and no test will be perfect,
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.400]   but they're pretty good.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.880]   And so then if you ask the question,
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:25.880]   well, what is the heritability for IQ test score
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.840]   well, the answer tends to be different
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.040]   depending upon the population.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:38.040]   If you look again in countries like the US
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.840]   or in Western Europe that are fairly affluent
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.840]   where people tend to have good access to nutrition
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.040]   and medical care and schooling and kids get to play
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.660]   and they're not traumatized by war,
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:57.660]   then IQ test score is heritable in the ballpark of 60, 70%.
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:06.240]   But if you look at people who don't have those benefits,
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.720]   who are poor, and this can be in the United States as well,
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   if you look at communities that face discrimination
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:20.740]   and have consistently poor healthcare and schools,
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.400]   then IQ is less heritable.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.240]   Why?
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.440]   For the very same reason that it is in height,
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:31.440]   because people can't live up to their genetic potential
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.320]   when they don't have the basic things that everybody needs.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:40.760]   - So presumably if two identical twins,
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.520]   and I realize they aren't identical,
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.460]   but you're familiar with twins, you have twin children.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:50.460]   If two identical twins are raised separately,
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:56.420]   the correlation in their IQ, is it that only 60,
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:02.080]   I think you said about 66% of their IQ can be predicted
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.820]   on the basis of their genetic makeup alone?
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.980]   I mean, it makes perfect sense to me as to why
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:11.940]   if one of those twins went to schools that were demanding
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:14.460]   of a lot of different topic matter,
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.420]   and the other one went to schools
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:20.980]   where the instruction level was really deficient,
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.640]   that one would perform far less well on an IQ test,
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.740]   unless of course the IQ test
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:29.340]   isn't tapping into school-based knowledge,
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.900]   it's tapping into some other thermometer
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.500]   of so-called intelligence or IQ.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.900]   - Well, you know, the thing is that good schools
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.940]   correlate with many other things, right?
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.620]   So the students that go to good schools
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.540]   aren't just benefiting from good schools,
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.740]   they tend to also have good medical care
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.900]   and safer, less traumatizing neighborhoods,
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.900]   and they're more likely to have books,
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.380]   parents with books in the home,
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:58.860]   and a whole number of things that are all beneficial.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.700]   So when you try to do epidemiology on this,
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.420]   you have to be aware that things
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.700]   are very deeply interconnected,
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.600]   but you bring up a good point.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.020]   So it turns out that the way we get these estimates
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.900]   of heritability, there's two ways.
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:17.900]   One way is to compare so-called identical
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:22.400]   or monozygotic twins with so-called fraternal
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.740]   or dizygotic twins.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:29.740]   So the identical twins will share nearly 100%
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.420]   of their gene variance, and on average,
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:38.420]   fraternal twins share 50% of their gene variance.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.800]   And generally speaking, when people do these studies,
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.880]   in order to avoid confounds of sex,
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.840]   they'll compare same sex fraternal twins,
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.320]   so boys to boys and girls to girls.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:56.760]   And when you put these incidents into a formula
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.580]   called Fisher's equation, then you can come up
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:03.040]   with an estimate of the heritability of the trait.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   But there is an assumption present in that,
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.740]   and it's called the equal environment assumption.
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:14.900]   You're saying, well, two kids raised in the same family
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:17.180]   have the same environment.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.980]   Well, that's not always true, right?
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:25.980]   That can be violated by a number of different situations.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:29.460]   So it turns out that a more powerful
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:33.740]   but much more difficult way to estimate heritability
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:38.300]   is by looking at twins reared apart,
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.100]   either identical twins or fraternal twins reared apart.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:46.300]   And there was a landmark study called the Minnesota Study
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:51.200]   of Twins Reared Apart, which is abbreviated MYSTRA.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.220]   That is really the gold standard for assessing
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.300]   the heritability of many different human traits,
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:02.420]   both behavioral traits, but also disease incidents.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:06.180]   But of course, it's a small M, because the population
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.820]   of identical twins reared apart that you can get
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.980]   into the lab isn't that large.
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.060]   They had something, I don't remember the exact numbers,
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:18.800]   but they had something like 80-some identicals
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:23.800]   and 50-some fraternals in their sample.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.140]   But by doing this, they were able to come up
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.940]   with a lot of interesting estimates.
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:33.940]   And so, for example, most personality traits,
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:38.460]   what the psychologists use the acronym OCEAN to mean,
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.900]   openness, conscientiousness, empathy,
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.860]   agreeableness, and neuroticism, I think I got that right.
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.500]   - Spelled right, yep.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.680]   - That these traits, on average,
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.020]   tend to be about 50% heritable.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.220]   And so, okay, you say, right, well,
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.820]   50% of those personality traits is heritable,
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:01.220]   the rest has gotta be like how you were raised.
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.860]   It's gotta be in your family.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.860]   And so, everyone was shocked when they actually
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:11.860]   did the analysis and found that family
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.540]   has almost nothing to do with it.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:19.340]   What, are you kidding?
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.220]   It's got to.
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:24.160]   And I think the important thing to realize
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.460]   is these traits I just listed,
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.100]   we call these personality traits,
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:29.820]   but they are not the sum total
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.340]   of the way you are in the world.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.620]   Parents can inculcate many things in their children.
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:38.740]   They can demonstrate trades,
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.820]   so people are much more likely to go into an occupation
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.260]   if their parents did.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:48.260]   They can inculcate moral ideas and religious ideas,
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:54.740]   but in terms of these ocean personality traits,
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.260]   they have astonishingly little to do with it.
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.780]   So then, this brings up the question,
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:04.540]   well, if 50% of the variation in these personality traits
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:08.820]   is not from your genetics and it's not from your family,
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.820]   where does it come from?
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:14.780]   And the answer seems to be is that it comes
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:19.780]   from the random nature of the development
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:23.060]   of the body and the nervous system.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.140]   And this is a point that I think
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:28.100]   many people don't understand.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.220]   This is something that biologists know,
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:35.180]   but we've done a very poor job of communicating
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.140]   to the general public.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:43.140]   The genome, all your DNA, all three billion bases of DNA,
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.500]   all 19,000 or so genes in a human,
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:53.500]   don't make a blueprint for making your body and brain.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.100]   It's not a schematic diagram
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.380]   that connects everything to everything,
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.020]   particularly in the nervous system
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:01.940]   where we have these hundreds of trillions of connections.
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:05.780]   Rather, it's a rather vague recipe.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:08.300]   So the genome doesn't say, oh, okay,
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:10.900]   you glutamate using neuron in the brain region
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:14.860]   called the thalamus, grow for 200 microns towards the top
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:19.060]   and then cross the midline and then grow towards the ear
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.220]   for another distance.
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.180]   No, it says something like, hey,
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.340]   you bunch of glutamate neurons in the thalamus
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.900]   over here in this area, about half of you
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.620]   cross the midline.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.260]   And so what does this mean in terms of individual variation?
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:35.500]   Well, it means, well, for some individuals,
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.700]   40% of their axons will cross the midline of the brain.
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.700]   And for another individual, 60% will,
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.780]   even in identical twins.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.580]   And as you correctly said a moment ago,
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:49.980]   identical twins aren't really identical,
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:53.420]   either in their bodies or their temperament.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.940]   So if you take newborn identical twins
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.060]   and you give them a CT scan
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.660]   just to measure the shape of their organs,
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.300]   they're not the same.
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:04.300]   You might have one twin whose spleen
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.940]   is 30% larger than the other twins
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.060]   or whose liver is 30% smaller than the other twins,
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.340]   even though they have the exact same DNA
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.940]   and they're lying right next to each other in the womb
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.220]   and presumably have the same
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:21.100]   or very similar fetal environment.
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:24.660]   And the reason is the random, or as we say,
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:29.580]   stochastic nature of neural development.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:34.460]   A great way to study this is with nine banded armadillos.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.300]   I know we're getting weird here, but.
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.780]   - I love the armadillo because I've been told,
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:42.340]   tell me, I don't want to interrupt you too long,
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:46.780]   but as far as I know, the only animal in North America
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.460]   that carries leprosy?
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:51.700]   - That is true.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:54.940]   - And there's a lot of twinning going on
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.180]   in armadillos, right?
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.900]   - Well, what there is is actually quadding.
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:03.100]   So armadillos, or the nine banded armadillo in particular,
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.180]   and there are different armadillos.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.060]   I'm not really an armadillo specialist,
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:07.460]   so I don't know if this holds for all of them,
[00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:10.220]   but the nine banded armadillo
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.740]   is born as identical quadruplets.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:16.420]   - Awesome. - Awesome.
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:19.360]   So you can take these identical quadruplet,
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.780]   newly born armadillo.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.020]   I don't know if you think you'd call them pups.
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:24.640]   I don't know what a baby armadillo is called.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:27.140]   I'm sure there's some particular word for it.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:30.060]   - Someone will tell us in the comments on YouTube,
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:31.780]   what is the name of a baby armadillo?
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:34.220]   I know like a ferret, baby ferrets are kits.
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:38.020]   The moms are Jills, the dads are Bobs.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.140]   I used to be obsessed with this kind of naming.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.540]   You know, it's a business of ferrets
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:45.700]   or what is like a gang of raccoons or whatever.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.780]   So if you can tell us what the name is
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.460]   for the baby armadillos,
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:53.020]   as well as what do you call a group of armadillos,
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.440]   you win the pride associated with being right.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.540]   - That's right, right.
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:01.100]   One of my favorites is an ostentation of peacocks.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.260]   - Amazing. - Or a murder of crows.
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.340]   - Who comes up with this stuff?
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.740]   - Yeah, I know, it's a good- - Or a raft of otters.
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:10.100]   I think that's correct, but.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:14.420]   - So if you have four newborn identical
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.980]   nine-banded armadillos,
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.460]   then this is a great model system
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.660]   that biologists can use to study
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:24.940]   stochastic differences in development.
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:27.420]   And sure enough, their brains are wired
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:30.620]   slightly differently, their bodies are slightly different.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.540]   If you test them behaviorally,
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.420]   even very, very early in life,
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:35.980]   they have different propensities.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:37.940]   Some are bolder and will explore more.
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.740]   Some will tend to hide in the corner more.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:43.140]   And you know, we know this from the lab.
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:46.660]   You get a box of mice that are inbred from the breeder,
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:47.580]   and you pluck them out,
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:49.500]   and they're not behaviorally identical.
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.420]   Some might try to bite your hand.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:52.860]   Some will run away.
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:54.940]   Some will stand stock still.
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:57.400]   Where does this behavioral variation come from
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.540]   in mice that are nearly genetically identical?
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.620]   Well, it comes from a bunch of things.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:05.500]   They don't always have exactly equal experience.
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.780]   But mostly, it comes from
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:13.060]   the pseudo-random stochastic nature of development.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.180]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.860]   and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.220]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.700]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.260]   to help you better understand your body
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.140]   and help you meet your health goals.
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.460]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.800]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.020]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.600]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.620]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.520]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.660]   about hormones, and so on,
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.660]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:43.980]   With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.740]   that makes it very easy to understand your data,
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.660]   that is, to understand what those lipids,
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.640]   what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.940]   and behavioral, supplement, nutrition,
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.940]   and other protocols to adjust those numbers
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.180]   to bring them into the ranges that are ideal
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.900]   for your immediate and long-term health.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:01.180]   InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.400]   of both ApoB and of insulin,
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.040]   which are key indicators of cardiovascular health
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.620]   and energy regulation.
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.060]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.860]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:14.620]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.620]   - And is the pseudo-random stochastic nature of development
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.300]   one of the major, excuse me, driving forces for evolution?
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.780]   Because, you know, we hear about mutations,
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:31.700]   and we always think, or people tend to think, rather,
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.380]   that mutations are bad,
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:35.600]   but of course mutations provide the variation
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.820]   that can also subserve adaptive traits.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.980]   I mean, if you're a fan of the X-Men, as I am,
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:44.060]   huge fan of the X-Men, the entire series, every single one,
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.540]   including the Wolverine movies,
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.400]   you quickly come to learn that genetic mutation
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.960]   is at the heart of variation,
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.820]   which is at the heart of individuality,
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:53.300]   which is what we're talking about.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.240]   - Right, and so genetic variation
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.300]   is at the heart of individuality,
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:02.300]   but there is also, there are also these other things, right,
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.460]   that we've talked about.
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.540]   There's the effects of early life experience,
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.900]   and there is the stochastic nature of development.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.920]   Because if you, through the randomness of development,
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.780]   happen to have like a particularly great liver,
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.780]   you're not gonna pass that on to your children, right?
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.940]   That isn't in your germline.
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:25.360]   You won't pass that trait along.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.760]   - Just a brief insert here on germline.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.700]   We had Oded Rajshafi on the podcast
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.140]   who studies epigenetic transmission
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:37.140]   and an inheritance of, it's not Lamarckian,
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.460]   we have to point that out,
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:42.580]   but inheritance of sort of acquired traits does happen.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:45.300]   And the germline is the genes that are present
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.860]   in the sperm and in the eggs.
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.620]   All the other cells of your body have genes, of course,
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.240]   but the best way to put this is simply going to the gym
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.780]   and getting fit does not make your children more fit
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.540]   because the germline, as far as we know,
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:03.000]   is not modified in a direct way.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.500]   In other words, the DNA within sperm and eggs
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.900]   are not modified according to your behaviors
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.880]   in most but not all cases.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.720]   - That's right.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.940]   And as you correctly said about Oded's work
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.740]   and other people's work,
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.580]   there is what's called
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.380]   transgenerational epigenetic inheritance,
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.400]   which means that you can have traits that are passed
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.920]   not from one generation to the next,
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.500]   but even two generations to the grandchildren
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.660]   that don't require modification of DNA.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:36.420]   But to date, that has been shown very convincingly
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:40.680]   in worms and in plants.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.900]   The evidence in mammals is really not there yet,
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.180]   in my opinion.
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.460]   And most of the claims for that,
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.700]   and it's a very popular thing to say,
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.940]   I epigenetically inherited my grandmother's
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:55.740]   or great-grandmother's trauma.
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:02.180]   The evidence at present is poor, actually.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:05.740]   A lot of it comes from epidemiology,
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:08.620]   most of which came from famines
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.740]   in the Överkallik's region of northern Sweden.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.820]   And they had very good medical records,
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:15.940]   and they said, oh, well,
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:18.580]   if your grandfather went through the famine,
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.180]   then you're more likely to have this trait if you're male,
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:22.980]   or if your grandmother went through this,
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.500]   then if you're male, you'll have this trait,
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.100]   and if you're female, you'll have that trait.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.900]   And I mean, there are two problems.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.940]   One is that there's not a biological mechanism,
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.860]   but the other problem is that the way these things
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:37.240]   were discovered is by something called harking,
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:41.460]   or hypothesizing after the results are known.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:46.260]   They did very many statistical comparisons
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:48.660]   to try to find something significant.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.560]   And you know from your work in the lab
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.600]   that when you do many comparisons,
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.260]   you're gonna get some things that look significant,
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:59.900]   just occasionally, randomly through luck.
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.980]   And you have to apply a statistical correction
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.820]   called a Bonferroni correction
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:08.340]   when you make many particularly post hoc comparisons
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.240]   after the experiment comparisons
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:15.460]   to set the bar much higher for accepting that data.
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:16.820]   And most of those studies,
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:19.600]   they didn't apply that correction.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.060]   And I remain unconvinced
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:27.620]   of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.980]   Now, let's be clear.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:34.300]   Just because it hasn't been shown convincingly now
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:37.020]   doesn't mean that it won't be.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.500]   There are some good people working very hard on this,
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:45.500]   and they may well describe a mechanism
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.460]   and show this convincingly in the years to come.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.540]   But right now, you may well inherit
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.520]   your grandma's or great-grandma's trauma,
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.180]   but you're probably doing it socially,
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:59.340]   not through marks on your DNA
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:03.760]   that changes how your genes are expressed or not expressed.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.780]   - Yeah, so I subscribe to the idea
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.820]   that there is absolutely,
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:10.540]   certainly transgenerational inheritance
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.500]   of parenting and upbringing, right?
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.780]   I mean, your grandparents raise your parents who raise you.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.140]   Not always people can be adopted.
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.380]   In fact, I have adopted members of my family.
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:22.980]   But if I understand what you're saying correctly,
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:26.860]   the evidence that, for instance,
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.140]   some stress-related gene was modified
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:35.140]   during a trauma in my grandparents or great-grandparents,
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:38.740]   and the idea that that was passed to me through my parents,
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:41.580]   that the evidence there is far weaker.
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.960]   - Right, and when you think about it,
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.300]   well, like, how did that happen?
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:49.300]   That had to get into your grandparents' sperm or egg cell
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:53.700]   and then produce that effect in the brain of your parents,
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:56.800]   and then it had to get into their sperm or egg cell
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.260]   and then contribute to producing it in you.
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:03.300]   - But fragmentation of DNA in sperm or in eggs
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:07.660]   is a common thing, especially as people age.
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.040]   DNA, sperm and eggs fragment,
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.340]   and it's possible that some of those mutations
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.340]   still allow for viable embryos.
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.960]   So in theory, the germline could be changed
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.900]   by environmental events.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.760]   - Well, right, but now I think you're starting
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.660]   to talk about things that are heritable, right?
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.260]   You're not talking about marks on DNA.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:32.040]   You're talking about the structure of the DNA itself,
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:36.920]   and that is its own separate issue.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.500]   Now, I think I wanna be really careful about this
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:44.280]   because what is now, I think, fairly well established
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:49.280]   is that you can transfer things epigenetically
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.740]   over a single generation
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:56.420]   if, as a result of experiences
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:00.340]   that the mother has during pregnancy.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:03.820]   So for example, we know
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:07.940]   that during the 1918 pandemic flu,
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:14.280]   many women were pregnant and got the flu,
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.800]   and if you look at their children,
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.920]   you find interesting statistical anomalies,
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.120]   and those children, for example,
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.000]   the males wound up going into the army for World War II,
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.400]   and of course, the army does a complete physical,
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:29.540]   and the records are very good,
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.840]   so you can go into that database,
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   and you find that the male children
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:42.660]   that were in utero during the winter of 1918,
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.240]   during the pandemic flu,
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.200]   are on average a millimeter or two shorter.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.080]   You might say a millimeter or two, that's nothing,
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.920]   but in a huge statistical sample of millions of people,
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.160]   that's enormously significant.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.320]   More interesting is that the incidence of schizophrenia
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.840]   went up about fourfold,
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.080]   from about 1% to about 4%,
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.080]   and even though autism wasn't a term in 1918 yet,
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.860]   I think it came along later,
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:15.620]   what we now retrospectively would call autism
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:18.800]   also went up by about fourfold.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.800]   So there's something about mom being stressed
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:28.320]   and carrying the fetus at a particular stage
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.440]   that seems to impact brain development in a way
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.880]   that then makes that child more likely
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.520]   to be schizophrenic or autistic when they grow up.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.800]   - Do we know that it's stress?
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.920]   And my recollection of this,
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.640]   I believe this was the late Paul Sternberg's work as well.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.900]   I maybe have that name incorrect,
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.760]   but in any event, that it is,
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:54.760]   if pregnant mom gets the flu in the first trimester,
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:01.040]   you see this higher incidence of schizophrenia
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.140]   and an autistic offspring.
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.500]   But do we know that it's stress per se?
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.920]   Because it's stressful to have the flu,
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.740]   but the flu is a bunch of other things.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:13.380]   Could be fever, could be some breakdown
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.260]   in the immune barrier.
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:16.360]   I just want to open up the number of variables
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.200]   that this could be,
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.320]   or do we know that it's something
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.940]   in the hypothalamic-pituitary so-called stress axis
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.840]   that is adrenals,
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.480]   so hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.820]   like is it elevated cortisol,
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:32.620]   or could it literally be an immune neural interaction
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:33.660]   of some other sort?
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:35.700]   - It's probably the last thing you mentioned,
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.460]   an immune neural interaction.
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:42.460]   And the reason I say that is that Gloria Choi at MIT,
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:46.760]   together with her collaborators,
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.540]   has made a mouse model of this phenomena.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.500]   So she takes pregnant female mice,
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:54.380]   and she injects them with something that,
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:56.780]   she doesn't actually infect them with virus.
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:00.280]   She puts a chemical in that is on the coat of viruses
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.600]   that mimics viral infection.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:06.220]   And then what happens is that in a way
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.140]   that interestingly is an interaction
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:12.620]   with the bacterial content of her gut,
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:17.620]   produces a surge of a immune signaling molecule
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:21.860]   called interleukin-17.
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:26.860]   Interleukin-17 can pass through the placenta
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:28.680]   into the fetus,
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.500]   and if it's present,
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.280]   just as you said at a particular point in development,
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.660]   doesn't work anywhere during pregnancy,
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:38.180]   but during something that is sort of the mouse equivalent
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:39.540]   of the first trimester,
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.940]   if that occurs,
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.520]   it causes disordered development
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:45.840]   of the layers of the cortex.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.580]   Instead of it looking like layers of a cake,
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:51.780]   you see balls and clumps of cells.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.020]   And parenthetically,
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:57.420]   in some but not all post-mortem tissue from autistic people,
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.660]   you can also see those balls and clumps of cells.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.240]   - Are those balls and clumps of cells
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:07.100]   thought to reflect alterations in cell migration?
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:08.840]   - They are, yes.
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.780]   I don't know if it's entirely known
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:13.420]   how much of it is cell division or migration,
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.960]   but certainly migration is a part of it.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.240]   And it's very likely that that critical moment
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.460]   to disrupt this ordering of the brain
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:26.560]   and produce these increases in schizophrenia
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.460]   or autism vulnerability
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:34.240]   are coming at a point where neurons are migrating
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.720]   during development.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.120]   And so what Choi's group did
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.880]   is they did all the things you would want to do
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.820]   as a biologist.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:45.020]   So they gave things to block the function
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.980]   of this interleukin signaling molecule,
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.920]   and it blocked the phenomenon.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.540]   They artificially injected the signaling molecule
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:55.240]   into fetal brain when the mom hadn't been stressed,
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.380]   and they could reproduce it.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:00.980]   So I'm not saying that there aren't effects
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:05.980]   of stress hormones from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:09.120]   that are important that you mentioned,
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.520]   but in this mouse model system work,
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.180]   it seems that you can produce it
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:18.180]   through this immune signaling pathway.
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.100]   And so then the question is,
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:23.340]   well, are these mice autistic?
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.720]   Well, how do you know if a mouse is autistic?
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.740]   And the answer is it's actually a little vague, right?
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.860]   There are behaviors that neuroscientists say
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:36.400]   are analogous of human autism.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.820]   And one of them is if you give a mouse a marble
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:44.300]   in its home cage, it will bury it over and over again
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.400]   compulsively or bury many marbles.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.160]   And people say that that is somehow analogous
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.780]   to some of the compulsive behaviors you see in autism.
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:53.460]   It's a bit of a stretch, right?
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.320]   I mean, it's a challenge to interpret mouse behavior
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.320]   in human terms, but it's a reasonable first step.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.940]   - Incredible.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:08.960]   And I hope more will continue to be done
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.500]   as it surrounds the first trimester influenza hypothesis,
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.940]   'cause it's been around a while.
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:20.940]   And obviously there's a spectrum of what we call autism,
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:24.760]   Asperger's, and nowadays people refer to it
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.860]   as sometimes as neuroatypical.
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:29.540]   There's some high functioning people with autism.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.480]   There's some low functioning people with autism.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.240]   And for that matter, there's some high functioning
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.740]   and low functioning people who don't have autism.
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:40.740]   So, but it is something that I think demands our attention
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:44.680]   and that hopefully will be resolved at some point,
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.680]   because also influenza is but one immune insult.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.560]   And presumably pregnant women are being bombarded
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.360]   with all sorts of viruses and bacteria
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.800]   and fungal infections and fighting them off
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.040]   or not fighting them off.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.520]   And who knows what the variation
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.520]   in neuro immune interactions exist in there
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:11.680]   that give rise to good variation
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:16.320]   and let's call it debilitating variation.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.840]   - Well, that's absolutely right.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.000]   And so for one example is that we don't know
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   what the effects are on the children who were in utero
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.960]   while their mothers were fighting off COVID, right?
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.160]   We won't know for a while.
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.180]   - Or the common cold.
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:38.840]   - And there might, I mean, there might be nothing,
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.280]   or there might be something serious lurking there
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.280]   like there was for pandemic flu.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:49.280]   And it will be very interesting and important to find out.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.400]   - Agreed.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:56.600]   I'd love to talk with you about mind body,
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.480]   but before we do that, I would be totally remiss
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:05.480]   if I didn't ask for your broad top contour understanding
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:11.840]   of the mini brain, the cerebellum, right?
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:12.960]   The so-called mini brain.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.100]   And here's why I've been a practicing neuroscientist
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:18.040]   for close to three decades.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.440]   I know where the cerebellum is.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.280]   I've dissected a bunch of them.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.140]   I could tell you where a few things are in there.
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:28.960]   And I certainly have read about what the cerebellum does,
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.600]   but whenever I do a PubMed search on cerebellum,
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.760]   I see an ever expanding set of things
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.740]   that the cerebellum is implicated in.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:42.640]   Not just balance as most people here, but also timing.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.720]   Also cognition.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.160]   I hear about timing in particular of motor behavior,
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.920]   but then I also hear that it's involved in learning
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.000]   and not just motor learning.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.840]   And it certainly is involved in motor learning.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.260]   Perhaps that little mini brain is doing 50
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.120]   or a thousand different things,
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:02.400]   but how should we think about the cerebellum?
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.780]   What is it doing?
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.220]   And what are some of its core operations
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:09.580]   that inform both what it's doing
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:13.580]   and perhaps what other areas of the brain are doing as well?
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:14.920]   Because I can point to the retinas
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.820]   or the auditory cortex or the thalamus.
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.860]   And yes, there's some mysterious nuclei in the brain,
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:22.320]   but to me, the cerebellum is one of the most cryptic
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.100]   and complicated structures to understand.
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.540]   And I know you spent some time in there.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.740]   So what's the cerebellum do?
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:32.360]   - Well, cerebellar researchers like to joke
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.220]   that the cerebellum is a counterweight
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:36.340]   to keep your head from falling forward.
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:37.180]   - Oh, perfect.
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:38.240]   Well, with all the texting nowadays,
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.600]   people need bigger cerebellums.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.440]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.760]   Probably over many generations,
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.800]   then that will happen along with a expansion of the thumbs.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.720]   But of course, everybody's going to text with their minds
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:50.040]   in about another 10 years, right?
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.480]   You'll have Elon's implant
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.560]   and you won't need your thumbs at all.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.200]   - Yeah, or maybe just five,
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.460]   or my friend Eddie Chang is a neurosurgeon
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:59.680]   and works on the auditory system.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.980]   He's been on this podcast before.
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:04.240]   He was saying that in theory, and actually in practice,
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.640]   you could just record the neural output
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.960]   to the muscles of the speech system, essentially.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.260]   And you could just amplify that
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:18.260]   and you could text without actually speaking.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.440]   In fact, when we read, he told me,
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.600]   we are actually receiving the signals
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.200]   as if we were going to speak the words we're reading,
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.360]   but they don't quite arrive at the place
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:33.120]   where you could get a full-blown postsynaptic potential.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:36.200]   So you're not actually moving the vocal machinery.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.960]   So that means the motor signals are getting sent out there
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.080]   and so you're speaking what you are reading,
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.320]   but you just don't know it.
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.580]   - That's right, and it's very analogous
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:47.760]   to what happens during the REM phase of sleep, right?
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.880]   When you have commands,
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.920]   your brain is issuing commands to your muscles
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.740]   to do things like behave in your dreams,
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.880]   to run away or go here or go there.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:03.440]   But those signals actually are blocked in the brainstem,
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.440]   prevented from reaching your muscles
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:11.440]   because the nerves that don't go through your brainstem,
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.960]   like the ones that control your eye movements,
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.400]   aren't subject to that blockade.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.840]   That's why you can produce the rapid eye movements
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.760]   in REM sleep.
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.800]   But yeah, this is a general theme in the brain.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.980]   A lot of times you have the output,
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:27.080]   but then you shut it down.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.080]   And there are REM sleep behavior disorders
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:35.080]   where people thrash and move in their sleep during REM.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:40.180]   And it's because this outflow that's normally blocked
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.960]   isn't blocked.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.400]   - Have you ever had the reverse happen?
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.120]   I have, where you wake up
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.120]   and you're still in so-called REM atonia,
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.440]   you're still paralyzed.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.040]   And there's that split second that feels like eternity
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.360]   where you are wide awake and you cannot move.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.120]   And I'll tell you, it's terrifying.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.600]   - Yeah, sleep paralysis.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.680]   And actually, it's been known forever.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.400]   You can actually find ancient Greek depictions
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:06.120]   of people lying with a demon on their chest,
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.240]   paralyzing them.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.440]   And that is actually from sleep paralysis.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:15.280]   Later, Hogarth did a drawing of exactly that.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.600]   So yeah, this is a well-known phenomenon.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:21.280]   But to get back to the cerebellum as we started,
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:27.320]   so the cerebellum is, as you said,
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:33.520]   definitely involved in motor coordination.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:36.960]   So people who have damage to the cerebellum
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.880]   aren't paralyzed, but they tend to be clumsy.
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:43.120]   They tend to not coordinate their movements.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.000]   They have a disturbed gait.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.520]   If they're reaching for an object, they often overshoot it
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:51.480]   and have to make successive approximating motions
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.560]   to get back to their target.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.000]   So that's well understood.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.280]   But if you look through evolution,
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:03.840]   the cerebellum is connected to this brain region
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.840]   called the thalamus, and it's connected from there
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.760]   to many regions, including the frontal cortex,
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.760]   where phenomena like planning and decision making
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:22.880]   and moral sense and many aspects of personality
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.360]   seem to be encoded.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.600]   So then the question becomes, well, that's very far away
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.600]   from being clumsy.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.040]   What are these connections doing?
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.880]   And as time has gone on, I've been in this business
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.960]   for over 40 years now, I'm an old guy.
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.440]   And so initially we said, oh yeah,
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:43.360]   cerebellum movement control, motor coordination,
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.280]   that's what it's for.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.800]   As time goes on, as you correctly said,
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.840]   the cerebellum has been implicated
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.600]   in more and more functions, many of which are far removed
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.480]   from the motor system.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.960]   And if we're looking for a theme about what the cerebellum
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.960]   does is that it is there to predict the immediate future.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:10.840]   It's trying to determine what's gonna happen
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:15.840]   in the next second or two to best guide behavior.
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:21.240]   And as you can imagine, this kind of general computation
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.040]   could be applied very well.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.240]   You can see why it's important for motor systems
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.200]   and doing sports and if you're trying to hit a baseball
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.480]   and looking at what the pitcher is doing
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.880]   and trying to anticipate what the pitch is.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:36.200]   But it also comes up in a social realm.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.180]   If we're trying to read someone and predict
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:41.080]   what they are going to do, is this person friend or foe,
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.520]   which is one of the first things that we try to assess
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   when meeting someone.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.880]   Are they competent, which is the second thing
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:50.320]   we try to assess when meeting something.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.200]   A lot of this depends upon predictive circuitry
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.640]   and it depends in part on the cerebellum
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:59.200]   and it seems to be at least partially impaired
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:02.160]   in people who sustain cerebellar damage.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:07.160]   So it seems as if interestingly, the cerebellum started out
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.940]   for prediction related for motor control
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:14.540]   and through evolution, its basic computation
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:19.540]   has been applied to other non-motor behaviors.
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:23.220]   Now I'm speaking in generalities
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:28.020]   and a lot of the details of this remain to be worked out
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:31.900]   and understood, but I would say that is in a nutshell,
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:34.660]   the modern conception of the cerebellum.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.580]   - Thank you.
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:39.220]   Finally, somebody explains to me at a top contour,
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:43.940]   but highly informed way what the cerebellum does.
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:45.900]   I couldn't be more grateful.
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.100]   - My pleasure.
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:49.900]   In all aspects of biology and life,
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.320]   the term nature versus nurture is relevant,
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:58.200]   but never so much as when thinking about the nervous system.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.500]   And I know this firsthand
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.420]   because I've studied neural development,
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:05.700]   both the nature side, the so-called hardwired stuff
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:10.320]   that genes just set up, neurons wire up to that neuron,
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.180]   et cetera, the cerebellum is in the back,
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.680]   the eyes are in the front, the hardwired stuff.
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:20.580]   And then the softwired stuff, the nurture stuff
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:23.680]   is the stuff that can be modified by experience.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:26.180]   What are your thoughts on nature versus nurture
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:29.500]   and should there even be a versus in there?
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.020]   - Yeah, I don't think there should.
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:36.020]   And I have a lot of problems with nature versus nurture
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:38.820]   as an expression.
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:43.820]   It was popularized by Francis Galton in the 19th century,
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:48.580]   a colleague of Darwin's.
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:53.580]   And I think it's wrong in or misleading in a lot of ways.
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:57.900]   So of course the nature in nature versus nurture
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:02.720]   is meant in this case to mean inheritability, right?
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:05.540]   What you inherit in the gene variations
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.460]   from your mother and father.
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:11.380]   And nurture means like how your parents
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:13.480]   or your community raised you.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.600]   The problem I have with nurture
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:20.600]   is that it is too narrow a term,
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:24.820]   that really it should be replaced with the word experience.
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:28.660]   And experience in the broadest possible sense,
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:32.240]   not just social experience,
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.340]   but the foods your mother ate
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:39.880]   when she was carrying you in utero,
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:45.140]   the diseases you fought off or your mother fought off
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.780]   while she was carrying you in utero,
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:52.360]   the bacterial population of your guts.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:57.640]   So experience meaning anything that impinges on you
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.180]   starting from the earliest stages of fetal development,
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.400]   continuing to the last day of your life.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.020]   I think it should be very expansive,
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:10.180]   much, much more than social experience in the family
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:12.500]   or the community.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.700]   And as you mentioned, I have a problem with versus
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:19.060]   because there's this idea that these things
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:22.640]   are essentially in opposition.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   Well, is he that way because of his gene variants
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.900]   or is that way because of what happened to him?
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:36.100]   And I think the thing to realize is that
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:40.540]   experience and heredity interact
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:42.860]   in all kinds of interesting ways,
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.620]   some of which are oppositional
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:48.420]   and some of which are reinforcing.
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:51.780]   A classic one from genetics has to do
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:56.660]   with a genetic disease called phenylketonuria or PKU,
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:01.660]   which is an inability to metabolize
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:06.420]   the dietary amino acid phenylalanine.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:10.460]   And so in order to have this,
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:13.540]   you have to inherit broken copies of this gene
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:15.420]   from both your mother and your father.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:18.380]   So it's a so-called recessive trait.
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:21.640]   And here's where the experience comes in.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.060]   It only matters if you eat foods rich in phenylalanine.
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:27.120]   If you don't, it doesn't matter
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.480]   that you inherited these things, right?
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:32.460]   So that's a way in which genes and experience interact.
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:37.460]   An idea of ways in which then they interact positively,
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:41.460]   think about athletic ability, right?
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:46.460]   So a lot of athletic ability has a heritable component.
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:51.280]   If you are born fast, for example,
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:56.300]   then you're more likely to do sports and practice them
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.780]   and get better at sports as a result of your experience.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:03.540]   So here, genes and experience are feeding back on each other
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:05.060]   in a positive feedback loop.
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:09.260]   So there really isn't a versus at all.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.060]   And then of course, the last thing
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:13.500]   is that this isn't the entirety.
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:18.500]   So we talked earlier about the pseudo-random nature
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.860]   of development, stochastic development.
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:26.420]   And so if I were to take the phrase nature versus nurture
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:29.660]   and reconfigure it, I would change it
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:34.660]   to read heritability interacting with experience
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:37.900]   filtered through the random nature of development.
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.620]   Now, that doesn't fall off the tongue
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:44.300]   as elegantly as nature versus nurture.
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.540]   You know, nature versus nurture is like,
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.900]   if the gloves don't fit, you must quit.
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:53.040]   You know, it's got that kinda snappy snare drum beat.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.580]   But I think it's a more accurate.
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:59.580]   - So heritability interacting with experience
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:02.940]   filtered through the randomness of development.
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:05.460]   So we can shorten that up
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:10.460]   and we'll just call it the Linden hypothesis.
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:14.580]   - You know, I don't think I can take credit for that.
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:15.740]   It belongs to other people.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.500]   - Sure, but there's a long history in science
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:22.300]   of things being shortened up and coined
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:24.460]   and that's as important.
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:27.720]   I'm not, we're not trying to rob attribution here.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:32.820]   And the good news is perhaps you can't call it
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:35.220]   the Linden hypothesis, but I can.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:37.940]   And what I've found is as with the Galpin equation,
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.580]   which is now out there as a hydration,
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:44.660]   it's a formula that gives broad
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:47.140]   but research-informed parameters
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:49.980]   as to how much water one should drink
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.800]   in order to maintain proper hydration.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:56.020]   For physiologists, Dr. Andy Galpin, who's a PhD in physiology
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.620]   and an expert in all aspects of exercise science,
[01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:00.500]   there's the Galpin equation, there's the Sobert principle.
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:04.200]   So I'm naming these things left and right where appropriate.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:09.200]   And so I'm naming these things sparingly
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.420]   and where appropriate.
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:14.660]   So from here on out, heritability interacting
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:17.000]   with experience filtered through the randomness
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.140]   of development is the Linden hypothesis.
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.740]   And I'll be damned if anyone's going to rename it
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:25.320]   faster than I'm going to propagate it.
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.300]   - All right, well, I think all the geneticists
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:31.380]   will be gnashing their teeth about this being named
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:33.320]   after someone who isn't actually a geneticist.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.160]   - Quite all right.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:35.780]   And their dentists will thank me.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:38.500]   Let's talk about mind-body.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:39.340]   - Okay.
[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:44.220]   - I'm fascinated by this for a couple of reasons.
[01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:45.580]   And I promise to keep this brief.
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:47.700]   But when I was growing up, I was very interested
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:50.300]   in animals and biology and my father's a scientist
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.660]   and I got very interested in neuroscience early
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.940]   as people perhaps know.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:31:00.020]   And so much of neuroscience as I was coming up
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:05.020]   through the mid 90s, 2000s, 2010 to 20 stretch
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:08.860]   was focused on the brain piece, very little on the body.
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:10.460]   There was nothing about gut brain access
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:13.000]   in the early discussions and coursework.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.140]   In parallel to all of that, I've been interested
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:18.620]   in mental health, physical health, and let's just call it
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:22.180]   performance and got interested in meditation,
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:25.340]   respiration based practices, things like yoga nidra,
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:29.580]   things that by way of experience, I understood immediately
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:32.540]   had a profound influence on the nervous system,
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:33.960]   states of mind and body.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:36.460]   Nowadays, there's an entire institute
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:38.620]   at the National Institutes of Health
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:42.180]   for complementary health and medicine, essentially,
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.660]   exploring things like yoga nidra, respiration practices,
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:48.220]   even supplements and things of that sort.
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:51.060]   And there's this understanding that, oh my goodness,
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:54.800]   the nervous system extends into the body
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:57.260]   and the body sends neural signals back into the brain.
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:00.420]   And so this whole notion of mind body has fortunately
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:05.420]   migrated away from kind of California counterculture,
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:10.860]   Esalen Institute only, you know, hippie new age,
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:17.060]   magic carpet stuff, by the way, that's not what I believe,
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:19.660]   but that's often how it was looked at in the past.
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:23.780]   And now people at every level of science and medicine,
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:27.440]   at every major university and in every scientific journal
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.740]   are starting to publish papers about the interactions
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:33.400]   between bodily organs, like the breathing apparatus,
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.700]   the diaphragm lungs, the heart, heart rate variability
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:41.900]   we hear about, the liver, the gut brain access in particular
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.300]   and so mind body, the idea that our thoughts
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:48.100]   could influence our body and that our bodily state
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:51.300]   could influence our thoughts is fortunately
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:56.300]   not just understood, but it seems to be both accepted
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.380]   and appreciated.
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:01.560]   So what are your thoughts on mind body?
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.260]   What does that mean to you?
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:06.160]   And what do you think is the potential
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.140]   of the mind body interaction?
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:11.540]   It seems to me we've just barely scratched the surface.
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:12.940]   - Yeah, well, I'm glad you asked
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:17.820]   'cause I think it's a really fascinating situation
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:21.620]   and where things are changing very, very quickly.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:24.440]   And I think to me, the most important thing
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:29.440]   for people to understand is that when you have a hypothesis,
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.660]   let's say you have a hypothesis
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:38.660]   that meditation can attenuate chronic pain.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.700]   Attenuate chronic pain, all right?
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:47.700]   Well, there is a temptation to think that this operates
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:51.660]   outside the realm of science and biology,
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:56.100]   that is in some airy-fairy realm in the clouds
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:34:00.260]   that this happens and I mean, for good reason,
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:02.800]   there are a lot of people who will describe it
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.300]   in exactly that way with auras
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:08.560]   or they co-opt scientific terms like resonance
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.600]   and energy but they don't actually use them
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:11.660]   in scientific ways.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:16.380]   So there's a lot of very fuzzy language that surrounds this
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.960]   but it shouldn't obscure the fact
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.060]   that when you have a hypothesis that say,
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:27.060]   some mental state like meditation or guided breathing
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:33.660]   affects some process in the body
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:37.300]   that you should be trying to understand this
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:40.180]   in terms of a biological hypothesis,
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:45.180]   not in terms of some indistinct realm that is different.
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:51.220]   - Like manifestation.
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:55.000]   - Yeah and I really learned this initially from my father.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.280]   My father was a psychiatrist, in fact,
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:02.500]   kind of a talking cure old-fashioned psychoanalyst
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:06.540]   who had his practice in Los Angeles
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:10.020]   and we would have dinner together every Wednesday night
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:14.580]   and he would always tell me about his patients.
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:16.980]   He was very careful to keep confidentiality,
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:20.180]   he wouldn't break confidentiality but I would say,
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:21.980]   oh, yes, how's your narcissist?
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:23.500]   Oh, he had this dream.
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.620]   So this was normal conversation
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:29.900]   when I was 14, 15 years old with my dad
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:32.340]   and one day I said, dad, it's really clear to me
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:35.220]   that through this talking cure,
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:37.380]   a large fraction of your patients feel better
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.620]   and they conquer their depression
[01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:41.980]   or their obsessive thoughts
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:44.380]   or things that are blocking them.
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:46.540]   How do you think it works?
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.900]   And he says, well, we don't really know the mechanics
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.920]   but ultimately when it works,
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:53.540]   it's not working in some airy fairy realm,
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:56.220]   it is working by changing the biology of the brain
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:36:01.420]   and when he said that, it was like a lightning bolt
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:04.440]   went off in my head and I thought,
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.220]   well, I don't have the kind of personality
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:10.000]   to be a talking cure psychiatrist,
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.140]   I'm not nearly nice enough
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:15.540]   but I could understand the underlying biology,
[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:16.700]   maybe I'll do that.
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:22.220]   And so as you've correctly pointed out,
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:25.320]   when you say the phrase mind body,
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.500]   you're talking about two directions.
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:31.780]   You're talking about mental functions affecting the body
[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:35.140]   and then you were also talking about how phenomena
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:38.980]   in the body affect the mind
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:42.500]   and we're understanding so much more
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:45.540]   about how that happens
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:49.660]   and I think the general thing for your listeners
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:54.660]   to appreciate is that we have some culprits here, right?
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:01.800]   And generally speaking, there are two classes of culprits.
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:06.900]   So if you want to get signals about the body to the mind,
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:08.080]   there's two ways to do that.
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.920]   One of them is through neurons
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.940]   that reach out into the body and sense things
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:18.240]   and this is referred to as introception, right?
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.120]   So as opposed to extraception, your outward pointing senses,
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.480]   these are the senses that monitor your own body
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:27.960]   and while we can consciously be aware
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.440]   of a lot of that information,
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.820]   a lot of it is happening subconsciously.
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:35.020]   Like your breathing is happening automatically
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:37.080]   most of the time without you thinking about it
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:42.080]   and that depends upon sensors about your blood chemistry
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:45.480]   and the state of your lungs and a number of other things
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:48.080]   that are regulating that process
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:49.680]   and it's all happening in the brain,
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.360]   usually below the level of your conscious attention.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.920]   In addition to the neural signals,
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:00.920]   there is also a whole realm of hormonal
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:04.980]   or diffusible immune signals
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:08.080]   and what these are is that these are chemicals
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.040]   that are released into the bloodstream
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.160]   and that move throughout the body
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.520]   and that can activate neurons in the brain
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:18.600]   or in other parts of the nervous system
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:23.600]   to produce changes in mental function
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:27.800]   and I think the real thing that is exciting
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:29.440]   a lot of people right now
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.200]   has to do with immune signaling molecules.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:36.240]   So there's a class of molecules called cytokines
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:39.740]   and cytokines are basically the signaling hormones
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:42.520]   of the immune system and they can flow
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:46.040]   through the bloodstream and through lymphatic fluid
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:49.200]   and reach many parts of the body.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.160]   We've known for a number of years
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.440]   that the specialized receptors for these cytokines
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.600]   are found throughout the brain
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:01.320]   and yet we know very, very, very little
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.920]   about what they do
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:08.920]   and that's gonna be an astonishingly fruitful area
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.660]   of scientific research.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:14.320]   But to give one exemplar,
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:18.160]   there are a lot of things these days
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:23.160]   suggesting a link between inflammation in the body
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:28.280]   whether it be in the gut or in other places to depression.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:31.280]   Well, how might that work?
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.280]   Well, it could work either through inflammation
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:37.160]   sensing neurons sending electrical signals to the brain
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.960]   or and it's not either or, it could be both,
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:44.960]   it could be immune signaling cytokine molecules
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:47.340]   produced at the site of inflammation
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:50.220]   that then travel through the bloodstream
[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:52.900]   and the lymphatic system to then reach the brain,
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:55.840]   bind receptors and have effects.
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:00.840]   And so one of the mysteries about depression
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:05.900]   is that it's not that tractable to pharmacological therapy.
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:10.800]   So if you look at people who suffer with depression,
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.280]   about a third of people see significant benefit
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:19.280]   from modern SSRI and related antidepressant drugs.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:24.400]   About a third see very tiny benefit
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:27.860]   and about a third see no benefit at all.
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:31.140]   And part of the reason is because maybe our term depression
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:32.580]   is too big a bucket.
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:35.580]   Depression is actually many different biological disorders
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:40.140]   and only a subset of those are helped by SSRIs
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.600]   and will need different therapies for the other ones.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.520]   That's certainly part of it.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.980]   But part of it might actually have to do with inflammation.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:50.940]   So if you think that inflammation
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:53.540]   is a risk factor in depression,
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:55.500]   well, you could do something very simple, right?
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:59.060]   You could gobble an ibuprofen, right?
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:01.660]   There's a whole bunch of anti-inflammatory drugs
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:03.900]   that are very well understood.
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:05.700]   And so, well, what if you just say,
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:07.980]   all right, let's have a study
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:09.920]   where we have a bunch of depressed people
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.380]   and we have them all eat anti-inflammatory drugs
[01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:15.280]   for a few weeks and we see if this relieves their depression
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:19.700]   and the answer seems to be no, it doesn't.
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:24.200]   Well, and that's a little bit hard to understand
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.520]   because there are definitely links
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:28.640]   between inflammation and depression.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:31.200]   So for example, one of the early treatments
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:36.100]   for hepatitis C that's since been superseded
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:37.600]   by more modern drugs
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:41.800]   was a pro-inflammatory cytokine molecule.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.360]   And when you gave it to people to treat their hepatitis C,
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.200]   almost everyone became depressed on this drug.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.820]   So you say, oh, well, this really seems like a link.
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:57.140]   Likewise, there are certain neurological diseases
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.680]   like multiple sclerosis.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.000]   It turns out the incidence of depression
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.120]   as a comorbidity in multiple sclerosis is enormous.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:06.960]   And you might think, well,
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:07.840]   there's a trivial reason for that.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:11.360]   If you're paralyzed from MS, you're bummed out about life.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.200]   And that's the reason.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.780]   But if you look at people who have spinal cord injuries
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:18.320]   from accidents, they actually have major depression
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:21.020]   at a rate from people who are uninjured.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:22.240]   So that doesn't seem to be it.
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.460]   It's not just that you're bummed out from being paralyzed,
[01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:25.960]   although of course it's reasonable
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.960]   to be bummed out about being paralyzed, but that's not it.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.060]   So what happens in MS?
[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.720]   Well, there's a bunch of cytokines,
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.840]   including one called interleukin-6, IL-6.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:39.560]   That's elevated massively if you take a spinal tap
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.720]   and you look at cerebral spinal fluid.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:44.800]   And so that could be causative for depression.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.720]   So all these real reasons to think
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.400]   that inflammation is involved,
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:51.400]   but yet the idea is still a little messy.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.280]   So now what if instead of looking
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.820]   at the general population of depressed people,
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:58.500]   you look at the subset of people
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:02.600]   that don't respond to SSRI antidepressants?
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.920]   Are they helped by anti-inflammatories?
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:09.880]   And there's a bit of a hint that maybe they are.
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.240]   It's not definitive yet.
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.960]   There are a couple of studies.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.340]   It's right on the edge.
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:19.000]   But I think this is a really good example
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.960]   of how we are gonna see progress very soon
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:28.960]   in the body-to-mind part of mind-body medicine
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:34.380]   that is going to be of enormous benefit to people.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:36.800]   - So interesting.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.600]   Could I get your thoughts on one candidate hypothesis
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.720]   that I've been thinking about?
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.180]   I've covered depression on a few episodes,
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:48.720]   and I've had Robin Cardart-Harris from UCSF
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:52.480]   and Dr. Matthew Johnson from your very own John Hopkins
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:54.720]   University, both of whom work, run laboratories,
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:57.800]   studying psychedelics for the treatment of depression.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:01.800]   The clinical trials on psilocybin.
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:04.560]   And to be clear, psilocybin is still illegal.
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:06.100]   It's been decriminalized a few places,
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:07.740]   but we're not talking about recreational use.
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:10.280]   We're talking about several therapy sessions
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:12.200]   and then two, without psilocybin,
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.920]   then 2.5 gram, approximately,
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:18.240]   dosages of psilocybin given separately,
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:19.680]   again, with therapists present,
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:20.980]   and then follow-up therapy sessions
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:24.080]   seem to lead to relief of depression
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:29.080]   in approximately somewhere between 65 and 80% of people,
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:30.460]   in some cases, total remission,
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:32.840]   in some cases, some relief without remission.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:36.200]   Okay, so we can kind of set that result on the shelf.
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:39.160]   It's been repeated a number of different times.
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:41.240]   Compare that to the results of SSRIs,
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.960]   which seem to help a third of people,
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:46.440]   a third minimally, and a third not at all.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.460]   And of course, there's the side effect profiles
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.400]   of the SSRIs and associated drugs,
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:53.720]   not just the SSRIs, but bupren and the other antidepressants
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.440]   that are taken in prescription drug form.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:58.740]   And then there's this inflammation piece.
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:03.740]   So could we hypothesize that relief from depression
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:06.240]   has something to do with neuroplasticity,
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.300]   rewiring of neural circuits,
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:13.300]   and that psilocybin, we know, can encourage neuroplasticity,
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:18.900]   and that perhaps SSRIs can encourage neuroplasticity
[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:21.220]   in some people, not all,
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:24.480]   and that inflammation is a barrier to neuroplasticity?
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:27.960]   To me, this is the only thing that can reconcile
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:30.640]   the current status of the results.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.160]   And then there's ketamine-based therapies,
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.040]   and so we have to also kind of set that on the shelf,
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:35.540]   but let's set that aside on the shelf
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:36.840]   for now to keep it simple.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:41.160]   It seems to me that based on the time course
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:43.100]   over which SSRIs work,
[01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:45.960]   the fact that they increase serotonin very quickly,
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:48.080]   but the relief from depression comes from much later.
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.360]   The fact that neuromodulators like serotonin
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:52.560]   are intimately involved in neuroplasticity,
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.600]   they can, in some cases, gate neuroplasticity,
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.880]   that it all centers back to changing neural circuits.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.060]   And so what we're really trying to do,
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:01.080]   whether or not it's transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.440]   or now we can throw ketamine in there,
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.960]   or psilocybin, or SSRIs,
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.060]   that treating depression is about rewiring the brain.
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:10.520]   It's not about chemical A or B per se,
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.380]   although serotonin seems involved.
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:17.740]   To me, what I'd love to see are more studies
[01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:21.120]   about the interaction between neuroplasticity
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:22.440]   and inflammation.
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:24.720]   And are we seeing that kind of work out there?
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:28.320]   And because these results sort of sit as disparate,
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:29.360]   somewhat conflicting,
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:33.120]   but it seems like inflammation is anti-neuroplasticity.
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.400]   And broadly speaking here,
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.180]   I realize there are many interleukins.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:38.520]   There are many, you know, some of which are inflammatory,
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:40.260]   some of which are anti-inflammatory,
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:43.040]   but is that a meaningful hypothesis?
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:47.140]   And do you think there's any hope whatsoever
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:48.560]   to actually cure depression
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:53.560]   if we sort of start to unify the results
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:55.080]   in these different camps?
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.640]   - Yeah, I think it's a completely reasonable hypothesis,
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:58.680]   and I would be broader.
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:00.440]   And I would say, honestly,
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:04.520]   the relief of any neuropsychiatric condition ultimately
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:07.160]   is from neuroplasticity in some form or another.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:10.700]   And I think it's worthwhile to step back a bit
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:14.240]   and talk about what neuroplasticity means.
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:19.240]   To date, there has been a focus on synapses,
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:21.560]   on the contacts between neurons
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.640]   as the site of neuroplasticity.
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.920]   And that's warranted.
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.200]   Synapses are plastic.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:29.380]   They change as a result of experience,
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:31.760]   as a result of hormone changes,
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.360]   as a result of exercise,
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.920]   as a result of lots of things.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:39.280]   But synapses are not the be all and end all
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:40.820]   of neural function.
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:45.200]   So for example, neurons work by sending electrical signals
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:49.400]   along their lengths and between neurons
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:51.840]   and interconverting those with chemical signals.
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:56.320]   And the processes of generating those electrical signals,
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:58.640]   the ion channels that are involved,
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:00.320]   that are embedded in membranes,
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.040]   that are involved in that are also plastic.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:06.360]   They can also change as a result of experience.
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.920]   That's what we call intrinsic plasticity
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:12.000]   as opposed to synaptic plasticity.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.840]   In addition, there are literal morphological changes.
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:19.660]   So when we talk about the wiring of the brain,
[01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:21.940]   sometimes we're talking about literal wiring,
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:24.380]   like cell A wasn't connected to cell B
[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:26.700]   and now it is and that changes.
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:29.220]   And then sometimes, well actually cell A
[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:32.220]   was connected to cell B but cell B wasn't responsive enough
[01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:33.720]   and now there's a change in cell B,
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.940]   so now cell A can fire cell B.
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:38.420]   And that could have been a result of a change in its synapse
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:42.460]   making it more receptive to a transmitter release from cell A
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:44.580]   or it could be something intrinsic in cell A
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:47.060]   that makes it fire its electrical signal,
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:49.840]   let's spike more easily.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.840]   I think that one of the key cell types
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:49:00.140]   that's going to be important for your hypothesis,
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:06.220]   linking inflammation to synaptic plasticity
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:09.700]   is going to be a cell called the microglial cell.
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:12.840]   And microglial cells are non-neuronal cells in the brain,
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.420]   they're motile, they can crawl around,
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:20.420]   they have long processes and they can gobble things up.
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:23.520]   They can literally sort of chew away
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.740]   and digest bits of the extracellular scaffolding
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.740]   that surrounds neurons and synapses
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.900]   and thereby renders them plastic.
[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:37.900]   They can destroy synapses and there is a lot of indication
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:40.620]   that certain disease states may involve
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:44.940]   over exuberant microglia pruning synapses
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.580]   to a degree that they shouldn't.
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:52.020]   And we know that microglia are chock full
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:56.860]   of cytokine receptors and so are responsive
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:59.560]   to inflammatory signals.
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:01.620]   When we're talking about inflammation
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:03.240]   and we're talking about drugs,
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.820]   it's worthwhile to mention that there are a lot
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:10.060]   of behavioral things that also can influence the signaling.
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:13.820]   So we know, and I know you've discussed on your program,
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:17.740]   the incredibly salubrious effects of physical exercise
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:19.260]   on mental function.
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:23.620]   So exercise is about as good an antidepressant
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:28.620]   as SSRIs are and the side effects are only good side effects
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:32.500]   as opposed to the bad side effects of SSRIs.
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:36.340]   And again, this isn't working through some airy fairy realm.
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:40.060]   The reason that exercise works to relieve depression
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:41.980]   and the reason that exercise works
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:46.260]   to maintain your cognitive function as you age
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:49.020]   is because of biological pathways
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:50.500]   that we are now uncovering,
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:55.380]   some of which will involve microglial cells and neurons
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:57.020]   and other types of cells in the brains,
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:00.980]   some of which will involve not the neurons
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:03.780]   in the brain at all, but the brain's vasculature.
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:07.460]   So we know that exercise is very salubrious
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:10.060]   for keeping blood flowing to the brain.
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:12.820]   And when you're young, you have a super abundance
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:13.980]   of blood flowing to your brain.
[01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:16.220]   So it doesn't matter if it's reduced,
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:18.380]   transiently, you're fine.
[01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:22.740]   But as you get older, your blood vessels become more occluded
[01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:27.740]   and less elastic and you're closer to the trouble spot.
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:32.260]   And if you exercise regularly,
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:35.580]   you can dilate and make your blood vessels,
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.860]   including those in your brain, more elastic.
[01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:41.220]   And that is almost certainly protective
[01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:46.220]   against both depression and cognitive decline as we age.
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:50.480]   - Well, I am a fan of exercise,
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:52.720]   but I'm fortunate that I enjoy running
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:55.560]   and some forms of resistance training.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:59.020]   So I always assumed that the good side effects
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:00.820]   were just the positive mood effects
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:04.320]   until the recent literature that, as you mentioned,
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:09.320]   improve vasculature blood flow and reduced inflammation,
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:10.780]   if not during the exercise
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:13.320]   when inflammation actually increases,
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:15.440]   decreases inflammation.
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:18.280]   I'm delighted to hear you say the word microglia.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.520]   And my postdoc advisor, the late Ben Baras,
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:22.880]   would be especially delighted.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:23.840]   People can look up Ben.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:27.240]   I'll provide a link to his biography
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:28.200]   in the show note captions,
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:31.760]   because he really championed, to the point of,
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.600]   I don't know if champion's even a sufficient word.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:35.940]   I mean, Ben was beating the drum saying,
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:37.220]   "We have to pay attention to glia.
[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:38.400]   We have to pay attention to glia."
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.720]   For the longest time, glia were relegated
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:42.920]   to these other journals.
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:44.060]   They even had their own journals.
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:45.880]   And in the last, what is it, 10 years,
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:48.840]   there's been a kind of explosion of research
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:51.580]   exploring the role of microglia in other glial cell types.
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:56.200]   And it's really fantastic to see that this,
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.360]   actually the most abundant cell type in the brain
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:00.440]   is the glial cell,
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.960]   are getting the attention they deserve.
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:04.920]   - It's absolutely true.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:08.880]   And, you know, we scientists like to think
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.360]   that we're very rational creatures
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:11.960]   and we're not subject to fads,
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:14.300]   but we totally are, right?
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:18.580]   When I started out in this field in the early '80s,
[01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:21.440]   everything was about opioid peptides.
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.120]   And then there was a period where gaseous neurotransmitters
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:27.160]   like nitric oxide were all the rage.
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:29.820]   And, you know, right now glia are in the spotlight,
[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:30.660]   for a good reason.
[01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:33.500]   I'm not trying to say that it isn't worthwhile.
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:37.580]   But there is this phenomenon of things being faddish
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:40.140]   and people jumping on bandwagons.
[01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:43.840]   And it happens both in terms of the subject we study,
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:48.200]   but also in terms of the techniques we use.
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:53.200]   And right now, the technique that is most faddish
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:59.040]   involves single cell expression profiling.
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:02.880]   That is, creating a list of what genes are turned on
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:06.020]   and how strong they're turned on in single cells
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:08.680]   and seeing how that changes in different cell types
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:09.940]   and with experience.
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:13.140]   And it's a very valuable technique,
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:18.140]   but one could argue that it is perhaps a bit overused
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:21.500]   in that 15 years from now, people will go back and say,
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:24.940]   "Gosh, those folks in 2023 were really overdoing it
[01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:27.040]   with the single cell profiling."
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.220]   - Yeah, and if anyone's thinking about getting into
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:32.020]   the field of neuroscience or another area of biological
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:34.020]   or other research, I can just tell you that
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:36.140]   if you're starting your PhD or your postdoc,
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:38.540]   take a look at whatever fad is happening now
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:39.940]   and just know that in five years,
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:40.940]   it will be something different.
[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:43.540]   And it takes you about five years to finish your PhD
[01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:45.620]   or postdoc, so pick something different
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:49.500]   than what's faddish now and you'll land right on the money.
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:50.760]   - There's always a lot to do.
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.900]   You don't have to do what everyone else is doing.
[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:56.740]   - And indeed, the deletion test becomes relevant here.
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:54:58.900]   The deletion test, as it was described to me
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:01.980]   by my colleague, E.J. Cichulinski at Stanford is,
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:05.980]   if you look around and you see one or more groups
[01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:07.900]   doing what you want to do very well,
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:08.860]   just pick something else.
[01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:10.900]   Your life's gonna be a lot more pleasant.
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:15.980]   - Absolutely, I agree with E.J. on that entirely.
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:18.340]   - Let's get back to mind-body.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:21.860]   There are a bunch of different domains of mind-body
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:25.020]   as you so aptly pointed out, it's bi-directional.
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:27.480]   Mind informs the body, body informs the mind.
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:32.800]   But we could probably break this down into respiration.
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:37.060]   So breathing, conscious patterns of breathing,
[01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:39.380]   emphasizing inhales or emphasizing exhales,
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:41.720]   cyclic hyperventilating, et cetera.
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:44.980]   Could also be thought patterns.
[01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:46.300]   A little bit harder to break those down,
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:50.340]   but many, not all, but many forms of meditation
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:53.400]   involve having a very still body, not all,
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.780]   there's walking meditation, et cetera,
[01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:58.420]   but still body focused mind.
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:01.820]   Kind of a, not a state that we are in a lot of times
[01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:03.220]   unless we direct that state.
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:08.940]   There are still other mind-body patterns of communication
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:12.260]   through very still body, deep relaxation,
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:14.880]   things like yoga, nidra, non-sleep, deep rest.
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:18.720]   There's hypnosis, there's touch-based
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.940]   body-mind communication.
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.740]   If we're gonna talk about mind-body,
[01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:26.820]   also we should refer to as body-mind,
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.900]   how do we dive in and think about this?
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:31.020]   Because this is involving clearly
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:32.540]   a thousand different neural pathways,
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:34.620]   not just the vagus nerve.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:36.180]   Typically people just kind of hang their hat on.
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:37.540]   Mind-body must be vagus nerve,
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:38.820]   and of course it involves the vagus,
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:42.260]   but the vagus is an extensive set of pathways.
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:45.860]   So how do you like to frame up mind-body?
[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:47.100]   And what's most intriguing to you
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:49.700]   about mind-body communication,
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:53.260]   both in terms of the biology and its practical applications?
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:55.700]   - Well, I think just as we talked about
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:57.980]   how there are two potential pathways
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:00.560]   in conveying signals from the body to the mind,
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:03.060]   there are also two potential pathways,
[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:04.780]   at least two potential pathways
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:09.780]   to conveying signals from the brain to the body.
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:14.060]   And they are the neural signals
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.540]   that are conveyed by neurons that actually get there.
[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:20.500]   And they are hormones and neurotransmitters
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:24.100]   and cytokines that are released from the brain.
[01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:26.020]   I should mention that hormones
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:28.140]   are actually produced by neurons,
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:30.640]   including, for example, some of the hormones
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:34.440]   that you think about as being produced as sex hormones,
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:36.960]   like estrogen is produced by neurons
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.360]   in your brain, for example.
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:44.740]   So let me give an example that I think is a bit out there,
[01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:48.780]   but I think is really, really fascinating.
[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:53.780]   And this comes from the cancer world.
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:59.220]   And so melanoma is a bad cancer.
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:00.780]   It kills a lot of people.
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.100]   It can spread.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:04.580]   It's highly metastatic.
[01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:09.580]   And we know that melanomas often become innervated.
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:13.680]   That is to say, they become contacted by neurons
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:16.300]   and are wrapped and receive signals from them.
[01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:20.220]   And we also know that if a melanoma becomes innervated,
[01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:25.220]   then the prognosis for that patient is worse.
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:27.500]   It's more likely to grow.
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:29.740]   It's more likely to spread.
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:31.220]   Well, how does that happen?
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:35.160]   Well, recently, there have been some reports
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:40.160]   that show that neurons that innervate the melanoma
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:45.740]   don't act directly onto the tumor cells.
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:49.980]   Rather, what they do is they secrete a signaling molecule
[01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:54.820]   that has a receptor on immune cells
[01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:59.160]   that are patrolling the edges of the melanoma tumor
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:02.220]   and nibbling away at it.
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:07.220]   And when that signaling molecule is released from the neuron,
[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:12.980]   it shuts down or reduces that immune patrolling function.
[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:20.060]   And then as a consequence, the tumor can grow and spread
[01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:22.820]   and butt off more readily.
[01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:24.740]   - So the signal that comes from neurons
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:27.620]   is sending the ambulances home, so to speak.
[01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:29.060]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:31.020]   And the signal is something called
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:35.720]   calcitonin gene-related peptide or CGRP.
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:40.240]   - I'm familiar with CGRP from the domain of touch
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:44.580]   and its involvement in, I think like itch perception.
[01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:47.300]   - Pain perception and itch perception, right.
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:48.140]   - Interesting.
[01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:49.980]   - Yeah, and so, all right.
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:54.980]   So if neurons can affect the progression of cancer
[01:59:54.980 --> 02:00:03.340]   through their activity, and these neurons in the periphery
[02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:05.420]   are ultimately connected to the brain
[02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:08.580]   through a couple of different hops,
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:14.260]   then is it reasonable to hypothesize
[02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:19.260]   that mental processes could affect cancer progression?
[02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:22.860]   So let's say we have a hypothesis
[02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:25.980]   and it's a wild hypothesis and I want to just emphasize
[02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:28.360]   that there is not evidence for this,
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:31.180]   but let's make the hypothesis that says
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:34.180]   that through meditative practice,
[02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:39.180]   you can slow the progression of certain tumors
[02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:45.360]   that tend to get innervated, right.
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:49.540]   Well, right now, this is just kind of a wild idea,
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:53.020]   but I think the important thing, as I've said before,
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:57.540]   that this is a wild idea with a biological substrate.
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:00.380]   It's not like you meditate and magic happens
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:04.100]   and force fields open and the angels sing
[02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:07.620]   and then your tumor shrinks.
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:11.760]   This is, we are saying that activity in certain areas
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.020]   of the brain is increased by this meditative practice
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:17.380]   and that this sends signals to this neuron
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:19.440]   and this neuron that actually go to the tumor
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:22.640]   and make something happen through this biochemical pathway
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:25.220]   that we have defined, right.
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:27.940]   And to me, this is speculative,
[02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:32.940]   but it's also extraordinarily exciting, right.
[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:38.580]   It opens a kind of investigation
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:41.920]   of mind to body signaling
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:46.920]   that has received very little attention up to now.
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:49.780]   - Incredible, and I say incredible
[02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:54.680]   because while you're giving an example of CGRP
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:59.300]   and nerve innervation and metastatic tumors,
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:05.680]   I absolutely love the idea that a phenomenon
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:09.300]   involving some practice that could be put under the umbrella
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:10.820]   of mind-body or body-mind
[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:14.860]   becomes something entirely different
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:17.300]   when we're trying to hang that
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:19.820]   on the hook of a biological process.
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:22.620]   It's like something fundamentally changes there, right.
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:27.240]   It's amazing to me, for instance,
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:30.620]   that early on, psychedelics and breath work,
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:33.420]   conscious breath work, were lumped together,
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:35.800]   cost people their jobs at major universities.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:36.940]   I won't name the universities
[02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:39.020]   'cause you work at one, I work at another,
[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.320]   and there's a third one called Harvard.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.580]   I guess I just named them.
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:45.000]   But nowadays, there are laboratories
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.280]   at every single one of those institutions
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:50.240]   studying deliberate respiration on health,
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:55.240]   as well as psychedelics and meditation for that matter
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:58.560]   with the goal of understanding what cytokines,
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:00.560]   what neurotransmitters, et cetera,
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.080]   change through defined pathways, including vagus,
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:07.520]   but phrenic nerves and frontal cortex
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:10.520]   and all the stuff that is considered
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.160]   classic rigorous neuroscience.
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:14.880]   So I do think we've entered a new era.
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:17.280]   So it's not costing people their jobs anymore,
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:20.440]   it's actually giving people their jobs.
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:21.960]   And it's federally funded,
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:25.240]   which itself is also fantastic, in my opinion.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:28.060]   So we are in a new era.
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:31.040]   - What do you think needs to be done
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:35.040]   to really nail down the idea
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:38.020]   that how we think influences our biology,
[02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:39.680]   even though it's a total duh,
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:42.800]   because everyone knows that chronic stress, for instance,
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:44.040]   can be detrimental.
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:47.100]   Short-term stress can actually be beneficial.
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:48.960]   And stress is a mental process
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:52.260]   that essentially deploys chemicals in the body
[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:55.320]   that then create other issues in the body
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:58.820]   that then create shifts in mental processes.
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:01.840]   It's so obvious when it's spelled out,
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:03.720]   but it's just remarkable to me
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:05.700]   how this has just been lumped in the category
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:08.280]   of like woo science.
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:11.900]   And I can't quite figure out what needs to be done
[02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:14.180]   in order to convince people that their nervous system
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:16.520]   includes stuff outside the skull and spinal cord.
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:20.000]   And of course, of course, of course it would work this way.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:20.840]   - Well, right.
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:25.840]   I think it is the job of biomedical researchers right now
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:32.880]   to reclaim a lot of this from the realm of nonsense.
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:39.600]   And the problem is there has been a lot of nonsense.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:44.040]   And, you know, there's sort of a visceral reaction.
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:46.680]   You know, when someone says, oh, yeah,
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:50.920]   well, you can do breath work and it'll realign your chakras
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:55.920]   and that is, you know, what will reduce your anxiety
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:59.040]   or your gut inflammation.
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:01.020]   And I'm tempted to just go, oh, shut up.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:02.680]   - But what if the chakras are collections
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:05.320]   of nerve innervation, of bodily sphincters,
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:06.760]   and, you know, it could make sense.
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:10.720]   - Right, it could, but there's gotta be some biology.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:15.040]   In some cases, these analogies are rooted in something real.
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:20.040]   And in some cases, they're just made up bullshit, right?
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:25.200]   And I think the challenge is to have really rigorous
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:31.200]   scientific tests of these things to take it back
[02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:33.400]   and to be willing to say, all right,
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:36.120]   there have been a lot of claims, for example,
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:39.960]   made about how mental processes can influence the body.
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:42.160]   And only a subset of those are gonna be true.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:48.120]   And of that subset, it is our job to understand
[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:51.080]   how they work, both to rationalize them,
[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:55.040]   but also to optimize them and make them better.
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:06:00.000]   I mean, there's no question that mental processes
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.240]   affect the body.
[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:05.480]   I mean, we know, for example, that if we just keep you awake
[02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:08.240]   and don't let you sleep long enough, you'll die.
[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:09.320]   And what will you die from?
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:13.000]   You'll die from sepsis, because the barrier between
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:18.000]   your gut contents and your peritoneum will break down.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.960]   Right?
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:24.280]   Well, so how does that happen, right?
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:26.120]   We're just starting to understand.
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:29.280]   There's a really dramatic example,
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:32.480]   but there are gonna be many more subtle examples.
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:35.520]   So you've mentioned breath work a couple of times,
[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:38.680]   and I think this is really interesting.
[02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:43.680]   My colleagues who are interested in respiration
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:49.240]   tell me that you can record in many different places
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:51.880]   in the brain, many different places in the neocortex
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:55.520]   and in other regions, and find a signature
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:58.520]   of the breathing rhythm sort of as a background
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:00.920]   to neural activity.
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:02.320]   You can find it in the cerebellum.
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:04.760]   You can find it in the frontal cortex.
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:09.320]   You can find it in the habenula, which is implicated
[02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:11.320]   in many things, including depression.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:13.520]   You can find it lots of places.
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:18.520]   So the idea that conscious modulation of your breathing
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:24.600]   could have manifold effects on neural function,
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:29.600]   I think is reasonable, given that kind of observation.
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:31.240]   Here, here.
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:36.920]   Let's talk about you a bit more.
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:41.360]   You've been so gracious in covering this wide array
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:43.560]   of topics and with such eloquence.
[02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:46.400]   And I must say, I've been delighting in all of it.
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:50.440]   You are in a unique position these days,
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:53.440]   because if I understand correctly,
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:57.560]   you've been diagnosed with a fatal illness.
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:07:58.840]   I suppose we've all been diagnosed
[02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:00.200]   with a fatal illness of sorts,
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.080]   because we're all going to die sooner or later.
[02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:06.720]   If you're willing, could you tell us the story
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:09.760]   of how that diagnosis came to be,
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:14.760]   what your initial reaction was, and where things stand now?
[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:18.840]   And then perhaps we can explore some of the,
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:22.360]   well, let's just say pleasant surprises that have emerged
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:24.280]   since that initial diagnosis.
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.600]   - Well, sure, I'd be happy to.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:31.600]   So in the summer of 2020,
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:34.560]   in the dark days of COVID,
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:37.640]   when things were looking really bad,
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:41.640]   I developed profound shortness of breath.
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:43.600]   I couldn't get up a flight of stairs
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:47.080]   without huffing and puffing.
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:48.440]   And I thought, oh, well, I've got COVID,
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:52.520]   but I took COVID vests and they were all negative.
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:53.920]   I thought, oh, I must have COVID.
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:55.760]   I've got the symptoms of COVID.
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:57.360]   I have respiratory issues.
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:58.200]   I'm feeling weak.
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:08:59.920]   It's gotta be COVID.
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:01.600]   And after a while, when this didn't go away,
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:03.560]   my wife said, you gotta go into the doctor.
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:04.720]   This is crazy.
[02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:06.480]   You gotta find out what's going on.
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:07.320]   And I did.
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:10.800]   And they hooked me up to an electrocardiogram.
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:15.000]   And they said, oh, you've got atrial fibrillation,
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.040]   meaning that your heart is doing two beats
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:19.920]   every time it should do one.
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:21.640]   So I have a very high heart rate.
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:23.440]   And when the heart beats that fast,
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:24.920]   it can't work very effectively.
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:28.760]   It earns enough time to recharge before the next beat comes.
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:31.760]   Now, it turns out that there is
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:35.640]   a very straightforward therapy for this.
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:39.480]   Atrial fibrillation comes from electrical signaling
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:42.480]   in the heart sort of swirling about in a circle
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.320]   and reactivating part of the heart muscle
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:46.520]   faster than it should.
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:49.920]   And so if you thread through a catheter
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:54.920]   in your groin up through blood vessels,
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:57.280]   you can put in a little needle and use that
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:01.000]   to cauterize and to ablate a tiny little strip of cells
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.480]   in the heart that will produce a barrier
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:06.920]   that will prevent that aberrant return
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:10.280]   of electrical activity and will cure atrial fibrillation.
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:13.680]   So I had that process, that ablation surgery.
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:18.680]   And sure enough, it cured my atrial fibrillation.
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:21.640]   I was feeling terrific.
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.720]   And they said, oh, as a follow-up,
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:27.320]   come back a few months later and we'll do an echocardiogram
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.560]   to see how your heart looks.
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:32.240]   And they did, and they went, oh my God,
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:35.560]   there's this huge mass pressing against your heart.
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:37.960]   It's like the size of a Coke can.
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:40.960]   Oh, here's what we think it is.
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:42.760]   We think it's a hiatal hernia.
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:44.560]   We think your stomach is poked up through
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:47.800]   the diaphragm muscle and it's nestling next to your heart.
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:50.280]   So the way we diagnose this, it's kind of humorous.
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:54.240]   They say, chug this can of Dr. Pepper
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:56.960]   and then quickly get up on the table
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:59.920]   and we'll do the echocardiogram.
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:02.320]   And in the echocardiogram, we can see a signature
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:06.240]   of the popping CO2 bubbles in your soda.
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:07.760]   And if we see those in the mass,
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:09.400]   then we know it's your stomach.
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:11.040]   So I did it, I chugged it, I got up there,
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:13.640]   oh, nope, it's not your stomach.
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:15.040]   They said, oh, okay.
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:20.040]   Well, what we think this is is a teratoma.
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:24.960]   And a teratoma is a developmental anomaly
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.520]   that you carry usually from fetal life
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:29.640]   where there's a group of different cells
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:31.160]   that gets in a place where it shouldn't
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:33.000]   during development and then grows.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.280]   You've probably heard about people
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:36.160]   who sometimes get like a tooth
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:38.280]   that grows hair in their abdomen.
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:40.480]   Sometimes women have these around their ovaries.
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:43.440]   And they're not malignant, they don't spread.
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:44.440]   It's a fairly easy thing.
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:47.280]   But I had this enormous Coke can pressing on my heart.
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:50.480]   It may have, we don't know, have been the source
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:52.680]   of my atrial fibrillation to start with.
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:55.120]   But in order to deal with this,
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:57.000]   I had to have open-heart surgery.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:02.000]   So I had the surgery and it was a big, hairy deal.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.680]   I was told it would last about five hours.
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:07.680]   It turns out it lasted two days.
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:08.940]   - Wow.
[02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:11.180]   - They had me on the heart-lung bypass machine
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:12.740]   longer than you're supposed to
[02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:15.720]   because you're very likely to throw a clot and get a stroke.
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:17.300]   Fortunately, that didn't happen.
[02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:20.480]   I had very skilled surgeons at Johns Hopkins.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:23.560]   It was bleeding so much that they couldn't close the chest.
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:24.620]   So they had to do all the surgery
[02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:27.780]   and then just leave me anesthetized with my chest open
[02:12:27.780 --> 02:12:29.520]   until the bleeding stopped.
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:31.700]   So the surgery was a bear.
[02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:35.480]   And then I'm waiting to get the pathology report
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.980]   back on the tissue they removed.
[02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:38.780]   And it came back and it was bad news.
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:42.360]   Sorry, it's not a teratoma, it's not benign.
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:45.760]   It is a kind of cancer called synovial sarcoma.
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:48.960]   And synovial sarcoma is a moderately rare cancer
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:52.240]   and it usually affects the synovium,
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:56.080]   which is the lining of the joints or some other places.
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:59.880]   It's pretty rare to have it happen in the heart.
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:01.380]   There are a few examples.
[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:03.460]   If you look in the biomedical literature
[02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:07.920]   for common cancers like testicular cancer or breast cancer,
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:09.840]   there are huge tables of statistics
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:12.520]   from millions of patients on what's been tried
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:14.760]   and what works and what the prognosis is.
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:16.940]   For synovial sarcoma of the heart,
[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:18.680]   there are only individual case reports.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:21.520]   Oh, there's a guy in Kenya and he got him, is what happened.
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:23.960]   There's a woman in Minnesota
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:25.800]   and this is what happened with her, right?
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:29.200]   There are no statistics because it's that rare.
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:31.660]   And the oncologist said,
[02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:36.660]   "Well, I think you've got six to 18 months to live."
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:42.840]   Now, this was about now 27 months ago.
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:51.120]   So I've fortunately exceeded that lifespan estimate.
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:54.320]   And I think we gotta be clear also that, you know,
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:56.360]   being an oncologist has gotta be a terrible job
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:13:58.120]   for many reasons.
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:00.500]   But one of them is that you gotta give a lifespan estimate
[02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:03.080]   even if you really don't have the data to do it
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:05.240]   in a very informed, you can't just say I won't do it, right?
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:07.200]   You gotta do it, people expect it.
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:08.680]   So, you know, I'm not saying like,
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:10.440]   oh, the oncologist was incompetent
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:12.220]   because I've outlived my estimate.
[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:13.800]   You know, he was trying to do something
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:16.640]   based on very little information, made his best guess.
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:22.800]   So, you know, I got this information and I was furious.
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:28.320]   I was so angry.
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:31.280]   Heart cancer, who the hell gets heart cancer?
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:32.240]   Is that even a thing?
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:34.040]   Have you ever heard of somebody with heart cancer?
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:36.480]   - Not until now. - No, heart cancer.
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:37.760]   What the F?
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:40.560]   I've got heart cancer, this is crazy.
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.960]   Time I was 59 years old, I was like, I got a lot to do.
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.000]   I can't have heart cancer.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.000]   And what was I think transformative for me
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:15:00.160]   is that at the same time that I was feeling white hot angry
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:05.960]   with the universe, I was also feeling a deep sense
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.280]   of gratitude for what I've had.
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:11.300]   I've had a terrific life.
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:13.720]   I'm not that young, I've had a lot of it.
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:18.480]   And I had great parents, wonderful friends growing up.
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:20.940]   I've had a good career.
[02:15:20.940 --> 02:15:24.940]   It's been a fairly easy run of it.
[02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:31.760]   And I think the ability to have a job
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:36.100]   where you follow your own curiosity every day,
[02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:37.100]   there's nothing like that.
[02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:41.220]   So few people in the world get to live that way.
[02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:43.960]   I feel incredibly grateful.
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:45.620]   And I feel incredibly grateful for my family.
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:47.320]   And I have a wonderful wife named Dina
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.160]   and she's just the best.
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:50.140]   How do I deserve this?
[02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:52.660]   I don't deserve her, honestly.
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:57.440]   So in neuroscience, we often think,
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:01.180]   oh, well, you have a state, you have a set point.
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:04.280]   Are you anxious or are you relaxed?
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:07.200]   Are you fleeing or are you approaching?
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:09.000]   It's like a single axis.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.060]   Well, but it isn't.
[02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:12.640]   And I think most people understand that.
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:16.900]   But me, I didn't until that moment really understand
[02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:20.040]   that I could feel profoundly grateful
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:25.040]   and profoundly angry in the very same moment.
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:32.580]   And having cancer and getting the kind of treatments,
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.400]   the chemo, the radiation, it's famously deeply unpleasant.
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:39.480]   And I had all that and it was just as unpleasant
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:43.640]   as anyone's cancer story that you've heard.
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:45.520]   The radiation burned my esophagus.
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:46.960]   I couldn't eat for weeks.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:48.100]   It was months.
[02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:49.800]   It was painful to swallow.
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:50.640]   Bad stuff.
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:55.040]   Lots of people have had to have bad stuff like this.
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:59.720]   And what I realized,
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:04.720]   this is, it's a deeply unempowering situation
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:08.000]   to be a medical patient,
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.760]   particularly when there's something serious.
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:12.440]   You have a limited sense of agency.
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:14.880]   Things are being done to you.
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:18.320]   Drugs go in you that make you feel really bad.
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:21.600]   And there isn't that much to do.
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:25.640]   And I realized that for me,
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:30.640]   the sense of agency came from being curious,
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:35.400]   from being a total nerd about things.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:40.360]   And part of what it made me curious about
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:44.240]   was my own mental processes as they related
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:47.740]   to my cancer and my cancer diagnosis.
[02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:51.720]   So for example, I'm getting the chemo
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:55.760]   and I should just say as background, I'm fortunate.
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:58.980]   I don't have a tendency for depression.
[02:17:58.980 --> 02:18:00.600]   I'm a pretty upbeat guy.
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:02.060]   I don't take any credit for that.
[02:18:02.060 --> 02:18:07.060]   I think I was just born lucky and raised lucky, right?
[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:12.560]   But day after day of feeling bad in your body from chemo,
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:15.340]   boy, it's hard to be positive.
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:16.180]   It really is.
[02:18:16.180 --> 02:18:17.440]   I could not overcome it.
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:20.600]   My mood got really, really low.
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:23.840]   And I could tell myself, this is gonna be over.
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:25.280]   It's not gonna go on forever.
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:27.760]   You won't feel this way forever.
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:30.200]   And you would think that as a rational person,
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:33.280]   I could talk myself out of that mood, but I couldn't.
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:36.920]   Probably because my brain was awash in interleukin-6
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:38.840]   and I couldn't overcome it.
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:39.680]   I felt really low.
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:41.960]   But at the same time, I was sort of out of remove
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:43.620]   being a nerd about going like, huh,
[02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:46.160]   I bet these cytokines are messing me up right now.
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:47.400]   I bet that's what's going on.
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:50.920]   And that gave me some sense of agency in a time
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:54.360]   where otherwise I really wouldn't have it.
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:56.200]   Another thing it really brought home to me
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:59.000]   is this issue that we were discussing earlier
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.680]   about how malleable perception is
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:05.560]   and perception of time in particular.
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:08.200]   If someone had said to me, when I was healthy,
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:11.960]   before I was diagnosed, you're gonna die in five years,
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:13.920]   I would have gone, oh, no.
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:15.520]   No, no, no, no, no, I'm 59 years old.
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:17.080]   I should get way more than five years.
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:18.480]   I got a lot of things to do.
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:23.000]   Professional things, personal things, family things,
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.040]   I got a lot of things to do.
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:25.080]   No, that wouldn't be right.
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:27.160]   I'd be very upset.
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:32.160]   But if you told me after my diagnosis of six to 18 months,
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:36.240]   oh, you get five years, I'd be like, five years?
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:37.640]   Yeah, that's pretty good.
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:39.520]   I can do a lot in five years.
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:43.960]   I can finish up in the lab and I can do some good work
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:46.200]   and I can spend time with my family and travel
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:49.560]   and savor life's pleasures and do all kinds of things.
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:50.720]   Five years, great.
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:53.840]   And of course, it's the same five years, right?
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:57.000]   The only thing that's different is the context.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:03.680]   But I think the thing that really I realized the most
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:11.120]   is that I really couldn't and still can't
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.560]   engage with the idea of myself being gone.
[02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:19.640]   So yeah, I can do practical things.
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:21.360]   I can update my will.
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:24.360]   I can write letters for my people in my lab.
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:27.420]   So if I kick off, they've got that
[02:20:27.420 --> 02:20:28.760]   to take to their next job.
[02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:31.520]   I can do all these nuts and bolts things.
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:36.520]   But in terms of genuinely engaging with my own demise,
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:42.680]   I really find that as much as I try, I really can't do that.
[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:46.680]   And at first I thought, well, that's just your own
[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:48.800]   lack of imagination, Linden.
[02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:53.300]   It's just because you're not very good at this.
[02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:56.480]   But the more I thought about it, I thought,
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:00.220]   actually, no, this is a human thing.
[02:21:00.220 --> 02:21:02.600]   This is a fundamental human thing.
[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:05.580]   And one of the things, when I look back
[02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:08.100]   on the 40 plus years I've been doing neuroscience
[02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:11.600]   that's different is that when I was first trained,
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:14.340]   the brain was really described as a reactive structure.
[02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:16.060]   Something happens in the world.
[02:21:16.060 --> 02:21:17.380]   You know, it comes to your sense organs,
[02:21:17.380 --> 02:21:18.300]   your eyes, your ears.
[02:21:18.300 --> 02:21:19.260]   It goes into your brain.
[02:21:19.260 --> 02:21:20.740]   It triggers some things.
[02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:23.780]   You think, you make decisions, and then you make an action
[02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:28.780]   that goes out to your muscles, and that's the loop.
[02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:30.820]   And that's what the brain does.
[02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:34.020]   And what we have known in more recent years
[02:21:34.020 --> 02:21:36.340]   is that actually when the brain is waiting
[02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:38.860]   for something to happen, it's not just idling
[02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:42.540]   and spacing out, that the brain is at every moment
[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:45.380]   subconsciously trying to predict the near future.
[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:51.180]   Predicting the near future is predicated on the idea
[02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:54.220]   that there will be a near future.
[02:21:54.220 --> 02:21:56.900]   That is to say that you won't be dead and gone, right?
[02:21:56.900 --> 02:22:00.180]   That there'll be a future for you.
[02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:05.180]   And so I think that my ability, which I think is actually
[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:09.740]   a human, I mean, not my ability, my failure,
[02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:11.400]   which I think is actually a human failure
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:15.300]   to truly engage with my own demise, is a feature.
[02:22:15.300 --> 02:22:20.300]   It is a side effect of the fact that the brain
[02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:23.540]   is always trying to predict the future.
[02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:28.540]   And so that was interesting to me just as a way
[02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:32.160]   that my illness was revealing something about the brain.
[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:34.060]   But it also made me think a lot
[02:22:34.060 --> 02:22:37.020]   about the world's religions, right?
[02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:38.580]   Religion is everywhere in the world.
[02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:41.820]   If you ask anthropologists, is there any society
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:44.980]   that doesn't have religious ideas, they'll say no.
[02:22:44.980 --> 02:22:46.580]   They say they don't always have the word religion.
[02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:48.420]   They might just say, well, yeah, in this place,
[02:22:48.420 --> 02:22:51.220]   everybody knows that the world's on the back of a turtle,
[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:53.980]   and this and this happened, there are these rules.
[02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:56.860]   They may not call it religion, but every place
[02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:59.900]   in the world has religion, not everyone is religious,
[02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:03.500]   but it is a cross-cultural universal.
[02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:06.900]   And most religions, not absolutely every single one,
[02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:11.460]   but almost every single one, has stories of afterlife
[02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:15.580]   or reincarnation in which your consciousness endures.
[02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:16.840]   Well, why would that be?
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:20.260]   And in many religions, they've got a deal, right?
[02:23:20.260 --> 02:23:23.140]   Follow these rules in life, and then you'll be rewarded
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:28.060]   in the afterlife, and that's a very general idea.
[02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:29.220]   - Or punished in the afterlife.
[02:23:29.220 --> 02:23:31.580]   - Or punished in the afterlife, right.
[02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:36.580]   And in some religions, you meld with the divine.
[02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:42.220]   In other religions, you're reincarnated as this or that.
[02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:43.140]   Heaven or hell, right?
[02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:45.780]   There's variance, but they share
[02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:48.180]   that your consciousness endures.
[02:23:48.180 --> 02:23:51.220]   And so why is this so popular all over the world?
[02:23:51.220 --> 02:23:56.220]   Well, I would hypothesize that it is a side effect
[02:23:56.220 --> 02:24:00.140]   of the fact that the brain can't help
[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:02.620]   but always trying to predict the future.
[02:24:02.620 --> 02:24:07.620]   When we can't imagine the world without us in it,
[02:24:07.620 --> 02:24:13.000]   then we are forced to concoct stories of the afterlife.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.920]   - Fascinating.
[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:21.180]   - And makes me want to ask about this feature
[02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:22.480]   of time perception.
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:28.840]   My undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc advisors
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:33.840]   all sadly died early, really, by pretty much any standard.
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:38.900]   And I was fortunate enough to be in communication
[02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:43.460]   with the last two as they were going through that process.
[02:24:43.460 --> 02:24:48.460]   Both of them described a heightened sense of gratitude,
[02:24:48.460 --> 02:24:51.920]   especially for things that previously
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:54.700]   they had not paid attention to.
[02:24:54.700 --> 02:24:57.300]   So we call this noticing the little things.
[02:24:57.300 --> 02:25:02.300]   But that makes me conclude that something
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:06.020]   about the knowledge of one's impending death,
[02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:11.020]   however far off that might be, shifts our attention,
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:15.100]   at least temporarily, leads to this sense
[02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:17.060]   of slowing down a bit.
[02:25:17.060 --> 02:25:18.820]   Because in order to shift our attention
[02:25:18.820 --> 02:25:21.600]   to quote unquote the little things
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:23.600]   or things that we previously overlooked,
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:26.140]   there's this sense of slowing down.
[02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:30.180]   And we know from basic videography, photography,
[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:33.380]   that slowing down means an increase in frame rate.
[02:25:33.380 --> 02:25:38.900]   Shooting at strobe frame rates
[02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:41.600]   gives you the perception of a strobe.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:42.980]   Shooting at very high frame rates
[02:25:42.980 --> 02:25:44.940]   allows you to see things in very slow motion.
[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:46.820]   You're noticing subtle variations
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:48.180]   that normally you overlook.
[02:25:48.180 --> 02:25:51.960]   I'm not trying to be overly reductionist
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:56.080]   about this process of enhanced gratitude
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:26:02.620]   that you described and how it was alongside intense anger.
[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:07.420]   But have you noticed a shift in your perception of time
[02:26:07.420 --> 02:26:09.860]   because you were given initially this,
[02:26:09.860 --> 02:26:12.220]   okay, X number of months.
[02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:17.220]   And then now with the, you're still here, fortunately.
[02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:20.700]   And with this kind of open-ended,
[02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:23.020]   well, it wasn't the prediction
[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:24.620]   that was given to you by your oncologist,
[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:28.060]   but it's unclear how long you're going to be here, right?
[02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:31.240]   Which is how most of us exist.
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:34.020]   You have the sense that it's sooner rather than later,
[02:26:34.020 --> 02:26:35.600]   but you don't really know.
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:38.300]   So I'm curious as to how the idea that,
[02:26:38.300 --> 02:26:40.380]   okay, you have 12 months more to live
[02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:44.540]   versus more than 12 months, but not infinite.
[02:26:44.540 --> 02:26:45.960]   But of course I know that I have,
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:49.060]   hopefully I have more than 12 months, but it's not infinite.
[02:26:49.060 --> 02:26:54.060]   So this idea of the finish line, the cliff,
[02:26:54.060 --> 02:26:57.780]   leaving aside whatever might happen afterwards,
[02:26:57.780 --> 02:26:59.380]   I don't know, haven't been there,
[02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:03.360]   it changes what we notice
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:05.560]   by way of changing our perception of time.
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:11.780]   I mean, this is a profound tuning of our perception.
[02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:13.280]   What are your thoughts on that?
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:16.240]   And do you notice that each sip of coffee,
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:17.620]   you probably don't notice each step
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:19.580]   across the kitchen floor in the morning,
[02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:22.500]   you're probably paying attention to your lovely wife
[02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:24.260]   and kids and things that day,
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:28.340]   but presumably it's dynamic,
[02:27:28.340 --> 02:27:31.700]   but what is your perception of time like now
[02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:33.040]   with the understanding that yes,
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:35.360]   you made it through the past the gate that was predicted,
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:39.340]   but what lies ahead is uncertain.
[02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:41.260]   - Yeah, so that's really interesting.
[02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:46.260]   And I would say definitely my perception of time is slower
[02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:50.840]   and it seems like an age since I was diagnosed.
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:55.840]   But I think part of that is because it's been action packed.
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:59.580]   In other words, since I was diagnosed,
[02:27:59.580 --> 02:28:04.580]   so many emotionally salient things, non-trivial things
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:06.580]   have happened.
[02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:10.980]   So many intense discussions with my wife and my friends
[02:28:10.980 --> 02:28:12.840]   and the people in my lab.
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:15.860]   My wife and I have taken a lot more vacations
[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:19.140]   than we normally do, so we're running all over the world
[02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:22.500]   and there's a certain sense of packing it in
[02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:25.560]   that I think influences time perception.
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:29.580]   But I would say actually for me personally,
[02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:32.940]   the gratitude isn't about the little things.
[02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:37.940]   The gratitude is about the very biggest things.
[02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:43.200]   The gratitude is gratitude for being a sentient being
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:46.980]   and having that blessing.
[02:28:46.980 --> 02:28:53.060]   The gratitude is for being able to have a life
[02:28:53.060 --> 02:28:58.200]   where I can follow my own ideas and creativity
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:03.840]   and my gratitude is for, choke up,
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:10.960]   the profound love that I've felt from my wife
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:11.800]   and my children.
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:15.400]   You know, it's not the little stuff.
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:19.720]   It's the big stuff that I think about
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:21.000]   when I think about gratitude.
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:26.000]   It's not noticing the sip of tea, it's the big issues.
[02:29:26.780 --> 02:29:31.780]   And for me, I want to delay my death
[02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:37.740]   as much as possible, of course.
[02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:43.800]   But when I think about it,
[02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:50.240]   the part that makes me upset is leaving people behind.
[02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:55.340]   It's not for myself.
[02:29:55.340 --> 02:29:57.120]   I've had a great life.
[02:29:57.120 --> 02:30:00.720]   I've had a lot of it.
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:02.400]   I'm 61.
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:05.160]   I'd like to go longer, but that's a pretty good run.
[02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:08.520]   I've gotten to do lots of things in those 61 years
[02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:13.440]   and have wonderful, loving, interconnected experiences.
[02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:17.440]   And so the negative part is about what I leave behind.
[02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:24.160]   - Certainly what you've left behind is enormous.
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:29.360]   And has been the consequence of actions
[02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:31.260]   long before your diagnosis,
[02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:34.340]   which I think is a clear lesson to everyone.
[02:30:34.340 --> 02:30:38.540]   I can't speak for you, but don't wait for the diagnosis.
[02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:44.040]   You've mentioned the sense of agency that you felt
[02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:48.100]   by being able to pay attention to
[02:30:48.100 --> 02:30:49.880]   and explore your experience of,
[02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:53.120]   let's call it what it is, impending death.
[02:30:53.980 --> 02:30:57.660]   And at the same time, as you mentioned,
[02:30:57.660 --> 02:31:02.080]   you've amplified and accelerated the number of things
[02:31:02.080 --> 02:31:04.120]   that you've put into the world recently,
[02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:08.300]   writing incredible articles about your experience
[02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:09.640]   of life and death.
[02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:11.520]   And we will, of course, link to those
[02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:12.760]   so people can read them.
[02:31:12.760 --> 02:31:16.620]   I've read them all and they are profound
[02:31:16.620 --> 02:31:19.440]   and they don't just feel important.
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:22.300]   They clearly are important.
[02:31:22.300 --> 02:31:26.260]   So very few people have your insight
[02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:29.520]   into the nervous system at the mechanistic level,
[02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:31.440]   but also at this more holistic level
[02:31:31.440 --> 02:31:33.760]   that you've clearly displayed to us here
[02:31:33.760 --> 02:31:36.100]   and in your research and in your book writing
[02:31:36.100 --> 02:31:37.320]   and public speaking.
[02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:44.580]   I think it's a risky thing to ask somebody for advice,
[02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:47.340]   but I can't help myself
[02:31:47.340 --> 02:31:52.220]   because I think it's a real opportunity
[02:31:52.220 --> 02:31:58.340]   if you had advice to give to any and all of us
[02:31:58.340 --> 02:32:02.620]   based on the whole experience,
[02:32:02.620 --> 02:32:06.480]   all of it from go, as they say.
[02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:09.920]   If you're willing and feel free to pass,
[02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:13.760]   but if you're willing, what is your advice?
[02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:18.760]   Well, I would say the advice that is really universal
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:23.840]   is what everybody already knows and is a bit trite,
[02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:26.440]   but I'll say it anyway.
[02:32:26.440 --> 02:32:29.840]   And that is appreciate what you got while you got it.
[02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:34.840]   And this isn't any big secret and everyone knows it.
[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:39.220]   I would say for a subset of people,
[02:32:39.220 --> 02:32:42.240]   the way of the nerd is very empowering.
[02:32:42.240 --> 02:32:46.200]   I don't think that's the case for everyone.
[02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:50.120]   I think for a subset of people
[02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:55.120]   who are deeply curious as their nature,
[02:32:55.120 --> 02:33:00.200]   turning that curiosity to your own mortality
[02:33:00.200 --> 02:33:03.700]   and your own medical situation
[02:33:03.700 --> 02:33:08.700]   can be empowering and useful.
[02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:14.240]   But I don't think that should be broad advice.
[02:33:14.240 --> 02:33:16.220]   I think that's only, for a fraction of people,
[02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:18.560]   that's probably the worst thing they could do.
[02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:20.720]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:23.780]   Everybody's different, right?
[02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:26.520]   Not everyone should adopt the way of the nerd,
[02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:28.680]   but for a fraction of people,
[02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:32.240]   it's a really, really good thing to do.
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:35.720]   - This is normally the portion of a conversation
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:39.000]   with a guest where I list off the many, many things
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.800]   they've done and how grateful I am
[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:43.500]   and all of that is absolutely true
[02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:45.460]   in the case of you being here today
[02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:46.400]   and the work you've done.
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:48.400]   But I think it's self-evident
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:51.420]   how much you've not just accomplished,
[02:33:51.420 --> 02:33:54.940]   but how much knowledge you've put into the world
[02:33:54.940 --> 02:33:56.840]   and not just scientific knowledge,
[02:33:56.840 --> 02:34:00.300]   but knowledge about the human experience
[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:02.680]   of others and of yourself.
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:07.680]   And so I just want to extend a giant thank you
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:10.480]   on behalf of the listeners and viewers
[02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:13.680]   and myself, thank you for coming here today.
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:15.420]   Thank you for doing what you do.
[02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:19.240]   And so great to still have you here
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:21.060]   and to have this conversation.
[02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:26.060]   And I hope it goes longer and no matter when it ends,
[02:34:26.060 --> 02:34:29.120]   you've done an enormous service to humanity.
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:30.440]   - Well, thank you, that's very kind.
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:34.320]   It's been a pure pleasure to have this discussion with you.
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:35.600]   - Thanks, David.
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:36.960]   Thank you for joining me today
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:39.320]   for this discussion with Dr. David Linden.

[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:12.000]   Not on today's podcast,
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.360]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:15.780]   we discuss supplements.
[02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:17.920]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:20.040]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:23.500]   for things like improving sleep, hormone support, and focus.
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:24.780]   The Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:26.440]   has partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:28.160]   If you'd like to access the supplements discussed
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:29.780]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:35:29.780 --> 02:35:32.300]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:35.280]   so it's livemomentous.com/huberman,
[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:37.440]   and you can also receive 20% off.
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:41.640]   Again, that's livemomentous, spelled O-U-S, .com/huberman.
[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:42.840]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:44.620]   to our neural network newsletter,
[02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:46.000]   our neural network newsletter
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.360]   is a completely zero cost monthly newsletter
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:50.940]   that includes summaries of podcast episodes,
[02:35:50.940 --> 02:35:52.720]   as well as protocols.
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:55.280]   That is short PDFs describing, for instance,
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:58.800]   tools to improve sleep, tools to improve neuroplasticity.
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:01.620]   We talk about deliberate cold exposure, fitness,
[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:02.900]   various aspects of mental health.
[02:36:02.900 --> 02:36:04.560]   Again, all completely zero cost.
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:07.320]   And to sign up, you simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:09.100]   go over to the menu in the corner,
[02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:11.280]   scroll down to newsletter, and provide your email.
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:13.640]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:15.560]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:18.000]   I am @hubermanlab on all platforms.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.960]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, Threads, LinkedIn,
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:23.560]   and Facebook, and at all of those places,
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:25.560]   I talk about science and science-related tools,
[02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:27.120]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:28.220]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:36:28.220 --> 02:36:30.440]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:31.640]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:34.860]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
