[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Let's start with an easy question about consciousness.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.760]   In your view, is consciousness something that's unique to humans, or is it something that
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.760]   permeates all matter, almost like a fundamental force of physics?
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.920]   I don't think consciousness permeates all matter.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.320]   Panpsychists believe that.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.320]   There's a philosophical...
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.320]   How would you tell?
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.320]   That's true.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.320]   That's a good point.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.320]   I believe in the scientific method.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.920]   I don't know about your mind or anything, but the scientific method is like, if you
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.040]   cannot test the hypothesis, then you cannot reach a meaningful conclusion that it is true.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.280]   Do you think understanding consciousness is within the reach of science, of the scientific
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.720]   method?
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.200]   We can dramatically improve our understanding of consciousness.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.160]   You know, I'd be hard-pressed to say that we understand anything with complete accuracy,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.280]   but can we dramatically improve our understanding of consciousness?
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.400]   I believe the answer is yes.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.960]   Does an AI system, in your view, have to have consciousness in order to achieve human
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.000]   level or superhuman level intelligence?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.960]   Does it need to have some of these human qualities like consciousness, maybe a body, maybe a
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.680]   fear of mortality, capacity to love, those kinds of silly human things?
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.680]   It's different.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.120]   You know, there's the scientific method, which I very much believe in, where something is
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:36.280]   true to the degree that it is testably so, and otherwise you're really just talking about
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.280]   preferences or untestable beliefs or that kind of thing.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.200]   So it ends up being somewhat of a semantic question where we are conflating a lot of
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.240]   things with the word intelligence.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:01.400]   If we parse them out and say, are we headed towards a future where an AI will be able
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.480]   to outthink us in every way?
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.540]   Then the answer is unequivocally yes.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.340]   In order for an AI system that needs to outthink us in every way, it also needs to have a capacity
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.760]   to have consciousness, self-awareness, and understanding.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.200]   It will be self-aware, yes.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   That's different from consciousness.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.680]   I mean, to me, in terms of what consciousness feels like, it feels like consciousness is
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.520]   in a different dimension.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.000]   But this could be just an illusion.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.700]   If you damage your brain in some way physically, you damage your consciousness, which implies
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.120]   that consciousness is a physical phenomenon, in my view.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.720]   The thing is that I think are really quite likely is that digital intelligence will be
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.440]   able to outthink us in every way.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.600]   And it will still be able to simulate what we consider consciousness to a degree that
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.520]   you would not be able to tell the difference.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.120]   And from the aspect of the scientific method, it might as well be consciousness if we can
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   simulate it perfectly.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.960]   If you can't tell the difference, and this is sort of the Turing test, but think of a
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.080]   more sort of advanced version of the Turing test.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:26.520]   If you're talking to a digital superintelligence and can't tell if that is a computer or a human,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.000]   like let's say you're just having a conversation over a phone or a video conference or something
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.840]   where you think you're talking, it looks like a person makes all of the right inflections
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.760]   and movements and all the small subtleties that constitute a human and talks like a human,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.240]   makes mistakes like a human, and you literally just can't tell.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.000]   Are you video conferencing with a person or an AI?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Might as well.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Might as well.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Be human.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.660]   Be human.
