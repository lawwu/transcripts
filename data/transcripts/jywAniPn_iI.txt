[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Walter asks, do you think it's possible to push past the four hour a day limit for deep work?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Yeah, Walter, it's possible.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   The four hour limit comes from research of professional musicians.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Four hours is roughly probably a cap on really intense deep work,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   but most knowledge workers don't get anywhere near that level of intensity.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   So that number came from the study of I think it was professional violin players.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   You see similar numbers for professional chess players as well.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   They do very intense training where they're trying to solve puzzles.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Here's a position puzzle, and it takes really intense concentration.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   There's only so much of that you can do, maybe around four hours.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Most people doing knowledge work are not anywhere at that level of intensity.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   What's actually happening in their brains, they're going up and down, focusing really hard,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   then relieving that pressure for a while, then focusing really hard.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   So yes, you could spend, and people do spend more than four hours working on things deep.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   The only addendum I would add is why?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I mean, if you're spending more than four hours locked in on one thing,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   really trying to push yourself past where you're getting good returns,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   the question is maybe you should just slow it down.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Good work day after day after day, let that break up.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So yeah, you can do it, but I wouldn't build a professional strategy around,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   let me spend 10 hours a day working on one thing.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I don't think you're going to end up in a much better place than spending three hours a day,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   but working on it day after day after day, that's probably going to get you to some better work.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And I don't know that you're going to save time heroically trying to fill your day anyways
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   because that brain is going to tire out.
