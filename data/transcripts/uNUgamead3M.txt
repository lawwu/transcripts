[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   I want to talk about a rule that we've talked about on the show and that's the 4% rule.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.880]   Yeah, this is the granddaddy of all rules of thumb and this is the idea of the 4% rule
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.820]   is this is the amount of your portfolio that you can withdraw each year during retirement.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.800]   So if you have a million dollar portfolio in the first year of retirement, you can safely
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.440]   withdraw $40,000 or 4% of that number and you can have a very high confidence rate that
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.920]   money will last you throughout your retirement.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.040]   And there are a bazillion different caveats that going into solving the what level can
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.280]   I really retire at, the length that you're going to be living off your portfolio matters.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.880]   There's something called sequence of return risk, meaning that the first few years after
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.440]   you retire, what the market does or your rate of return really impacts that.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.920]   There's also you have to factor in what are interest rates during the period that you
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.240]   retire for the 4% rule I think is a fantastic study point, but when you're actually making
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.440]   a "should I retire" decision, there's a bunch of other factors you need to consider.
