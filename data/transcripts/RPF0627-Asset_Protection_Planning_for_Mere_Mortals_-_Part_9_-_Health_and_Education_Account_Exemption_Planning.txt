[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:25.300]   I'm going to talk to you about health savings accounts in a moment where you can put $7,000 a year into that. Well, $7,000 a year for somebody who's making $100,000 a year can be a very meaningful contribution of 7%. $7,000 a year for somebody who's making $20 million a year is not at all meaningful. It's not that they can't still make that contribution. It's just that it simply is irrelevant.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.320]   and the risk of creditors. That's the common accepted use of this term. And so then in part two, I zoomed in on that. We talked about the

[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:22.140]   And those rules are very technical. For example, who is the beneficiary of the five to nine plan when it was when you were putting money into it? When was the contribution made? Was it 365 days before the bankruptcy court at seven ruling or set seven hundred days before the bankruptcy court.

[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:11.780]   strategy there is that you accumulate
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:11.780]   money in the health savings account and
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:11.780]   you save and document all of your medical
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:11.780]   expenses but you don't immediately take the money out of the account when you incur the medical expenses rather you use other sources of income other savings to pay for those medical expenses you
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:11.780]   you don't immediately take the money out of the account when you incur the medical expenses you
